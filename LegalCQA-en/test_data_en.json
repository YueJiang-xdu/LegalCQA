{"question":"In the current case of Dominion v Fox News, we saw that text messages from Fox News hosts have been admitted as legal evidence in court.My understanding was that text messages either had to be turned voluntarily, or they had to be forcefully retrieved by law-enforcement if they have a warrant.Either scenario seems somewhat unlikely to me : I cannot imagine Fox News hosts to voluntarily hand over incriminating texts, and I also struggle to see how they would have been forced to enforce it, given how hard defamation is to prove in the US.Does anyone have more details on how these text messages were obtained, and accepted in court?","answer":"Because the hosts are part of the defendants.A party in a lawsuit can demand documents to be turned over to them from the opposing party. That is called  and participation is mandatory. Not turning over the documents requested and not providing a good reason why they should not be turned over is contempt of court.Discovery under the Federal Rules is very broad. According to Rule 26(b)(1), &quot;Parties may obtain discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense.&quot; The federal rules also provide several tools that can be used to get information from other parties, including interrogatories, depositions, and requests for admission. A party may also compel other parties to give them access to documents, real property, or other things for review or testing. See The Delaware rules of Civil Procedure mimic the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure very closely, and . Especially interesting here is:Del. R. Civ. P. Super. Ct. 26 (b) (1) In general. - Parties may obtain discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition and location of any documents, electronically stored information (EST), or tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial.  [...]The hosts are employees of the defendant, the phones contain EST that is regarding the matter and relevant to Dominion's claim, and disclosure is proportional to the needs of the case. As such, The employer has to make them comply with discovery requests by the opposing party and hand over the text messages."}
{"question":"Overview: My partner has been going through a very drawn-out battle against the Portland police, mainly in regards to a single police officer. This officer had used various police resources and people to access personal information about my partner despite those inquiries having no lawful purpose. They also pulled information about family close to my partner too, which has been their own standalone case. This information gathering continued to happen on and off for years, some of which even took place after we told the city that we were concerned this may be happening  this was affirmed through an audit and investigation that took place.This particular officer has also had a past of other misuse of police resources, some of which they've been punished for or put their job at risk of termination. Throughout our research, their action clearly violates policies and some of the guidelines deem these repeated actions as being immediate grounds for termination. However, the feedback we've gathered so far suggests that this officer not only wasn't terminated or adequately punished, but that they've continued to retain full access to these systems that were abused.We're suspicious that there may be quite a few people in cahoots that is allowing this officer to avoid necessary punishment. Some of this suspicion comes from numerous contradictory claims in their communication compared to the documentation we received; the lack of transparency and effort when they were forced to report to other agencies (even ones above them); and that they have repeatedly went well beyond the deadlines of numerous statutes, resulting in some opportunities of tort to be impossible (we found these out afterwards, of course).It's worth noting that we've contacted a few lawyers. Some claim this case doesn't align with what they practice or is much bigger than they can handle; others have claimed that it may not be financially feasible to fight.Questions: If we went after the city (or state) for something like negligence (or whatever term fits the broad issues above), is it likely that we can recover monetary damages (and\/or attorney fees) since they seem to have sided with the officer?My partner has diagnosed PTSD as a direct result of these ongoings.This case impacted my partner's ability to continue with college and they needed to drop out. They intend to re-enroll as soon as financially possible.Are there any laws that force the police bureau to only retain quality officers for the public's best interest?Essentially, does the police bureau need a good reason for keeping this officer despite the guidelines saying they should be terminated?","answer":"Direct legal advice is off-topic here (as well as illegal - read the right sidebar), but two things you can do are:1) Keep looking for an attorney. You need to find one who feels strongly about your case and doesn't have conflicts of interests with the police department or city departments you will be up against. Write up a letter and send it to as many firms as you can in the Portland area. You may get a referral to a firm outside of Portland. An attorney will know what might be possible in terms of damages and awards, and a lawyer is pretty much required in a case like yours rather than trying to fight city hall yourself.2) Try to get a local newspaper or TV\/radio station to look into your case and do a story. 'Bad cop' stories are always interesting to the media, and such stories sell papers and bring web traffic. You may get a referral to someone outside the Portland area, too, if a local journalist feels they don't have the distance from a case like yours, or feel intimidated by the police department."}
{"question":"I currently work for a large company (>50 employees) that is denying my eligibility for FMLA because I reside in a state that has only 15 employees in that state. The company I work for does not have a physical office (I actually work from home) and claims the client site to be the office location. The client site actually has many locations across the US which would more than qualify me for FMLA. Is my understanding of the following exclusion correct?ii) any employee of an employer who is employed at a worksite at which such employer employs less than 50 employees if the total number of employees employed by that employer within 75 miles of that worksite is less than 50.My assumption for this exclusion is to protect a small business that could be negatively impacted by one or more employees taking FMLA due to the difficulty of finding a temporary replacement within 75 miles of the office.If the assumption above is correct, what if the position is able to be filled nation wide since it is a work from home position?","answer":"Unfortunately your employer is right. The rule says that in order for FMLA to apply to you, you must work at a location with 50 or more employees within 75 miles. Your client is not your employer, even if your employer considers it a place of business.This is outlined in :  (1) Commerce  The terms commerce and industry or activity affecting commerce mean any activity, business, or industry in commerce or in which a labor dispute would hinder or obstruct commerce or the free flow of commerce, and include commerce and any industry affecting commerce, as defined in paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 142 of this title.    (2) Eligible employee &nbsp;(A) In general The term eligible employee means an employee who has been employed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) for at least 12 months by the employer with respect to whom leave is requested under section 2612 of this title; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) for at least 1,250 hours of service with such employer during the previous 12-month period.    (B) Exclusions The term eligible employee does not include &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) any Federal officer or employee covered under subchapter V of chapter 63 of title 5; or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) any employee of an employer who is employed at a worksite at which such employer employs less than 50 employees if the total number of employees employed by that employer within 75 miles of that worksite is less than 50.So if you had 50 workers within 75 miles of you (regardless of state borders), then you would be eligible, unfortunately since you do not have that, you are not eligible for FMLA. The number of workers at the office that are not employed by your employer do not count.You are right that the reason for the 50 employee rule is to lessen an undue burden on an employer without adequate resources to cover your absence, but you don't have a case since you are not defined as an 'eligible employee' by law."}
{"question":"I have an uncle in China who is trying to make some investments in Canada. As you may know, there are foreign exchange controls in China, but everybody goes around them. One easy to do it is to match up money coming into China with money going out of China. I'm trying to help him move the money out (+$1 million USD). It seems the transaction would need to go through my Hong Kong bank account. I would then need to wire it back to the US into my US account. Then to the project. Would helping him this way violate any US laws?","answer":"As long as you don't lie in the course of these transactions, and you comply with U.S. tax rules, you will not be breaking any U.S. laws.If you do something like this in your personal accounts you will have personal reporting liabilities to the IRS.  (Though if you have a Hong Kong bank account you already have that obligation.)  The IRS may demand more information, and you may have a tax liability depending on how you explain the source of the funds.  An accountant could detail all of the IRS and tax implications.When you tell your U.S. bank that you want to wire in a large sum from an off-shore personal account they will alert you to whatever 'anti-money-laundering' requirements would apply.

{"question":"John Smith is over 18 but under 26. He lives with his parents in California. He has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder with possible comorbid psychological disorders.John has been hospitalized several times for psychotic episodes but more recently has been reasonably stable on medication. He receives health insurance under his parents' plan, but his parents refuse to pay for his co-pays, hospital bills, and other out-of-pocket costs. He currently receives disability money which allows him to pay for his co-pays.John is only marginally able to take responsibility for his own healthcare. He often does not schedule psychiatrist appointments until he has run out of medication (due to the nature of his medications, he must see the psychiatrist before every refill). He frequently misses scheduled appointments and spends more money on missed-appointment fees than on co-pays. He will discontinue new medications in as little as a week, without consulting with a doctor, if he believes he is experiencing any negative side effects. He refuses to take his medications at consistent times every day, and forgets to take his morning or evening meds at least once a week.John's parents do not take responsibility for his healthcare. They do nothing to make sure that he keeps his medications filled or takes his medications on time, nor make any effort to help him schedule or attend appointments.If John is unable to take care of his own medical needs, and his parents do not assist him in managing his medical needs, is it possible for a third party (e.g. a friend or parent of a friend) to assume responsibility for his medical care (e.g. scheduling appointments, picking up medications, administering medications)? Would this be termed Healthcare Power of Attorney (which is commonly associated with the elderly) or something else?If a non-family-member assumes responsibility for John's medical care, does the law still require that he (as an adult under the age of 26) be covered under his parents' healthcare plan?","answer":"As a preface, while the best course of action isn't always clear and the reality of implementing some solution is often rocky, the bipolar diagnosis situation you describe is probably the single most common situation in which legal arrangements must be made for an adult child, and is almost as common as the need for children to make legal arrangements for the care of their declining parents. You aren't the only one going through situations like these. Probably 0.5%-2% of people in any given area experience bipolar, usually starting in adolescence or young adulthood, and difficulties managing it of the kind that you describe are the rule and not the exception.Also, just ignoring the problems you describe is a very bad idea. Premature death either from suicide or bad judgment related to the bipolar diagnosis is all too common in these situations. It is serious business, not something that should be thought of as bad character, or futile to do anything about, or blameworthy. It just is, and if someone doesn't do something when the plan gets off course, serious consequences often follow. There are really several intertwined issues present here. Realistically, given the nature of the concerns expressed, a limited guardianship may be necessary to accomplish the goals expressed.What Are Medical Powers Of Attorney?A healthcare or medical power of attorney gives the person who holds it (who is called an 'agent' or 'proxy') the authority to make medical decisions for someone called the principal (i.e. John Smith) when the principal lacks the capacity to give informed consent at that very moment to do so. This is because a power of attorney is an inherently revocable document expressing the wishes of the person writing it. You generally can't bind yourself in the future without court approval or a contractual relationship with a third party which a power of attorney is not.It isn't uncommon for medical personnel to decide on the spot when to and not to listen to someone with a medical power of attorney based upon how mentally competent the patient seems at the time on a decision-by-decision basis. For example, they might defer to the medical power of attorney agent when the patient is unconscious or heavily drugged, and listen to the patient when the patient is conscious, not drugged, and not acting erratically.Parents, incidentally, do not automatically have this authority, nor do spouses.A medical POA is a document that allows the agent to say 'yes' when the patient (i.e. John Smith) cannot. Another name for a document that is very similar and sometimes used is a 'health care proxy.'It would typically cost a few hundred dollars to $1,000 to have a medical power of attorney drawn up after discussing the situation and the principal's needs in a meeting with a lawyer and might take an initial meeting and then a second one at which the document is signed after it is prepared following the initial meeting. Other lawyers might manage this in a single meeting and draft it while you wait.If all you need is a power of attorney, don't be penny wise and pound foolish by doing it yourself, unless the form is provided to you by the health care provider you will spend most of your time dealing with and they prefer their own form. Otherwise, the likelihood that you will have to pay more to a lawyer later cleaning up your own mistakes probably exceeds any money that you will save.Other Kinds Of AuthorizationsMany medical providers will allow someone to act on behalf of a patient in matters other than matters that call for the kind of medical decision that would normally require the informed consent of the patient, even when the patient is not manifestly incapable of making medical decisions at that very moment. This could simply be a note in the file that the patient has given that person authority to do so, it could be a written authorization to access HIPAA protected personal health information of the patient, and it could be a variety of other things (e.g., authority to make financial arrangements). Some of this is often incorporated in the same document as a medical POA.Picking Up Controlled SubstancesA Medical POA may, or may not, necessarily be sufficient to authorize someone to pick up a controlled substance on behalf of a patient if the patient is physically able to do so, without the presence of the patient. I don't know what the true rule of law under the controlled substances acts and pharmacy regulation is, but I do know that practice in real life varies quite a bit. The best practical solution to the issue of picking up controlled substances would be to ask the usual pharmacist what they require and to comply. (A legal guardian would generally have the power to pick up controlled substances for a ward.)Guardianships and Limited GuardianshipsWhat Is a Guardianship?A guardian of the person is someone appointed by a court who has the authority to make medical decisions and other personal life decisions for their ward (i.e. John Smith), even contrary to their apparent stated wishes. A guardian has the authority to say 'yes' and also to say 'no' to the expressed wishes of the ward, overruling the ward. A guardianship of an adult can be general, or can be limited on a customized basis.A guardian must be appointed by a court with jurisdiction over these cases, usually in the county where the ward resides. But, a guardianship can be requested by the ward as opposed to contested.Realistically, a court would be unlikely to grant a full guardianship or a contested guardianship in these circumstances, but might grant a limited guardianship with the consent of the ward in these circumstances. The parents and possibly any siblings, would have a right to notice of the proceedings and to object or to seek to be appointed instead.What Process Is Involved In Having a Guardian Appointed?This would realistically be a proceeding that should ideally involve a specialist lawyer (with experience in mental health or elder law and guardianships) and at least one medical professional's statement (probably a treating psychiatrist or psychologist). There would also probably be a court investigator or guardian ad litem appointed at the ward's expense, to confirm that the facts represented in the petition to have a guardian appointed really reflect the ward's intent. Usually, a proposed guardian selected by the adult ward during a lucid interval would have priority for appointment.The medical professional and lawyer should be able to provide good suggestions regarding what the scope of the limited guardianship needs to be, although don't ignore or fail to give full credit to your own layperson's practical understanding of the situation either.The guardian would have to provide information to the court in connection with the petition showing eligibility to serve (e.g. criminal record check, credit check, CV, nomination by ward). Often the guardian would have to demonstrate good intentions towards the ward in some way, especially if the guardian is a third party and not someone who serves as a guardian as a livelihood. Some courts would require the guardian to have insurance for liability in connection with the task or a surety bond up to some dollar amount.The final decision would usually be made in an in-person hearing at which the ward, the proposed guardian, the proposed guardian's lawyer, the medical professional, the guardian ad litem or investigator, the judge, a court clerk, a court reporter, and any family members who chose to appear (with their lawyers, if any), were present. If the guardianship was granted, perhaps with modifications requested by the judge to the terms of the guardianship, then the Court would issue what are called 'Letters' that formally appoint the guardian to the post.Once appointed, the guardian would have to file periodic status reports with the court and would also be subject to the court's jurisdiction in the event of any future dispute regarding the guardianship, or any allegations of misconduct by the guardian, or any circumstance that requires court approval such as a change in the terms of the guardianship or in the person serving as guardian.The procedural details I am describing are approximate and aren't necessarily up-to-the minute correct, and might vary somewhat even from court to court within California under local rules and customs of practice; but they give you a gist of what the process would be like if it is working properly and with best practices.Typically, this might cost $3,000 to $10,000 all in for an uncontested proceeding, and many times that much in the event of a contested attempt to have a guardian appointed.Health Insurance EligibilityI'll defer to someone else's answer regarding health insurance eligibility, as I don't have time to look into that at the moment. My instinct is that this wouldn't be a problem in any case except a guardianship and probably wouldn't be a problem even in a case with a third party guardian, but I can't confirm that without doing research."}

Taxes on imports and exports, and excise or &quot;use&quot; taxes, such as a tax on the manufacture and sale of whiskey, were not considered to be direct taxes.In 2007 a US Court of Appeals said, in Murphy v. Internal Revenue Service and United States, (case no. 05-5139, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit) that: &quot;Only three taxes are definitely known to be direct: (1) a capitation [ . . . ], (2) a tax upon real property, and (3) a tax upon personal property.&quot;In section 17 of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company (link below) the Supreme Court wrote:Ordinarily, all taxes paid primarily by persons who can shift theburden upon some one else, or who are under no legal compulsion to paythem, are considered indirect taxes; but a tax upon property holdersin respect of their estates, whether real or personal, or of theincome yielded by such estates, and the payment of which cannot beavoided, are direct taxes.This opinion goes into great detail on the history of the apportionment clause, and of direct and indirect taxes.See also .After a na6tional income tax was imposed in 1894, it was held (in 1895) to be unconstitutional under this provision. This was in .To the best of my understanding, no current federal tax is considered a direct tax subject to apportionment under this provision. Indeed the apportionment requirement, which was copied from the previous articles of Confederation, was so awkward that taxes which would be subject to it were never or almost never imposed, but ways were found to make any desired taxes not &quot;direct&quot;. This provision is, accordingly, obsolete as far as taxes go."}

{"question":"The other day I was on a small-ish two lane road where traffic in the other lane was traveling in the other direction.  I came upon an unattended stopped car with it's emergency blinkers on blocking my current lane.  Since I could clearly see no traffic was coming in the other lane I moved around the stopped car, briefly crossing the solid yellow line so I was partially in the wrong lane, before returning back into my own lane and continuing on my way.

{"question":"I've seen and read about lots of relatives of deceased wealthy individuals disputing the dead person's will and I've always been curious about this: Suppose I'm a lawyer (who I'm not) and I'm holding the will of a dead multi-billionaire. In his will, the dead guy insists that his wealth must go to many people other than his family.Now, let's suppose that I also happen to be an unscrupulous lawyer. At this point, I have only two options, the first one being that I can release the will and gain nothing but the fees for my services.On the other hand, because they are all excluded from the will, the guy's family might be disgusted by his betrayal. My second option will thus entail teaming up with the family to make the will disappear, provided that they can guarantee me a fraction of the fortune. The logic being that when there's no will, property gets divided up among the dead person's immediate relatives.At this point, I can see only three problems. The first problem being that his family might actually be in agreement with his will and there's the possibility that they mutually agreed to be excluded from it. The second problem being that his family are not in agreement with being excluded from his will but the people included in the will are aware of the existence of that will, and are also aware that they are mentioned as beneficiaries of the estate.The third problem being the matter of witnesses.Solving the first problem will be dead simple. I'll simply drop by their house, show them the will, and observe their reaction. If his family is shocked that their names are nowhere in or near the document, I'm in luck.Admittedly, the second problem will require much more work. All I'll have to do is find a way to completely ascertain that there is no copy of the will that I'm holding.Last, the witnesses. If the dead guy was a shrewd man, he'd have brought along people wealthier than him to witness his signing of his will, as they won't need any of his money. But let's just assume that all the witnesses are the kind of people who can be bought for a few million dollars.The way forward then becomes clear -- gang up with the family and make a lot more money than I'd otherwise make if I just handed over the will to the courts.Okay, since I don't know anything about law, I realize I might have made lots of naive assumptions but you get the whole drift.So what's to stop a rogue lawyer from pulling off something like this?EDIT:In retrospect, my question sounds highly unethical. But its purely an intellectual itch that keeps coming back to taunt me every time I come across property disputes.

{"question":"I am a citizen of the United States of America. As such, it is illegal for me to--to take an extreme example--murder. However, say I am going on vacation to a little nation where it is not illegal to murder--if you decapitate someone for stealing your oranges, the only thing that you'll have to worry about is the cleanliness of your machete. So I am in this country when another adult cuts me in line for the roller coaster. Naturally taking this personally and as an insult, I take out my machete and swing at my adversary; after realizing that I missed the cutter altogether, I pull out my revolver and shoot my opponent, and he dies. I have just murdered a man; however, because murder is not illegal in this country, I have done nothing (from the law's perspective) wrong. Upon returning to the US, of which I am a citizen, can I be tried for murder even though I did not do it in the US's jurisdiction?Does this apply to all actions that are unlawful in one jurisdiction but not another?Thanks a lot in advance for any responses. All are greatly appreciated!","answer":"What you're asking about is , and it will depend on the country and crime(s) involved.As an example, under Australian law, it is a crime to engage in sexual activities with minors barring specific exemptions, which are not relevant to this example.There are countries where the age of majority is less than that in Australia. If you were to travel to this country, you are not necessarily committing a crime there.However,  make it a crime to do this anywhere in the world. This is enacted (I believe) under the foreign affairs power of the Commonwealth Government.It will largely depend on the legal system of your country, as to whether laws have extraterritorial effect.

{"question":"I leased a new car a few months ago under certain conditions. Whether due to it being on the showroom floor or from whenever it was test driven, there were quite a few paint scratches and paint chips.Before agreeing to a lease, I said I wanted a written statement that the dealer would cover all paint scratches and chips. Once I got this in writing on a formal dealer IOU slip (it has three copies), I signed it as well as my lease agreement. All files were packaged up and the IOU was stapled to the lease contract.The dealer has yet to make good on their written promise and, in fact, has wasted my time by taking the car from me three times in order to do the paint yet the chips have never even been touched and most scratches remain. (One of the employees I know there said they actually never even took it in to the autobody shop.)Is the written agreement legally binding?","answer":"UK-based answer:I would consider the IOU be bundled together with the lease agreeement as all parts of a single sale transaction, because of that I would believe that this IOU is legally binding.One may argue that variations to contracts require consideration and therefore the IOU wouldn't be binding for lack of consideration, but in court it would be easy to say that the IOU formed part of the core transaction (rather than a variation to a previous agreement) since you wouldn't have been willing to purchase the car in the first place without the promise to have the scratches fixed.It should be legally binding afaik"}

{"question":"The recent news on Mac Miller's cause of death reminded me that I'm always puzzled when toxicology reports are made public. Is this mandated, and if so, is it by state or federal law? Why? Otherwise, it seems like it would be unnecessary and a bit invasive. I'm wondering specific about the United States here. Searching around hasn't revealed much and I appreciate your help.","answer":"There are laws affecting this at both the state and federal level, but by default, most government records are open for public inspection in the United States. If we can't see what the government is doing and how it's making it's decisions, we can't very well decide how to direct it as voters. The extent of openness varies from state to state, but I don't know of any states where an autopsy report -- or a related toxicology report -- would be considered secret. When people are dying of unnatural causes, the people have a right to know about the dangers in their community, whether that disease, drugs or violence.Although some people would argue that there is a privacy right in this information, the approach in the United States is generally that the rights of the living to understand what the government is doing outweigh the privacy rights of dead people.In Mac Miller's case specifically, the governing law would be , which provides that:  Except with respect to public records exempt from disclosure by express provisions of law, each state or local agency, upon a request for a copy of records that reasonably describes an identifiable record or records, shall make the records promptly available to any person upon payment of fees covering direct costs of duplication, or a statutory fee if applicable. Upon request, an exact copy shall be provided unless impracticable to do so.The records 'exempt from disclosure' are listed at Section 6254 and include:  Records of complaints to, or investigations conducted by ... any state or local police agency.California courts have interpreted the law as generally requiring autopsy reports to be disclosed upon request, but exempt from disclosure when the autopsy is part of a law-enforcement investigation:  [T]he coroner and autopsy reports involving the death of Elizabeth Cloer are exempt from public disclosure under the section 6254(f) CPRA exemption for local agency investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes. This exemption applies because these reports constitute an investigation of a death that was a suspected homicide in which the prospect of criminal law enforcement proceedings was concrete and definite..Because Mac Miller's death was apparently an overdose and therefore not likely to be the subject of a criminal investigation, the autopsy report -- and the toxicology report -- should be treated as a public record subject to disclosure."}

{"question":"In  came up, which states:Whoever utters any obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of radio communication shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.Interpreted literally, this is quite absurd: it would mean one can't curse on a cell phone, or view (otherwise legal) pornography with WiFi, both of which I'm pretty sure are legal activities within the US.I'm not so much worried this particular issue, but I am curious about the general case: there must be thousands of things like this which can be interpreted literally to make a subjectively absurd argument. What is the general principle that keeps application of law sane, and not devolve into chaos and pedantry?","answer":"This ultimately is a matter of . One of the principles of statutory interpretation is that all words are interpreted in their context. For your example, that means we look at the title of 1464, 'Broadcasting obscene language'. From this it becomes apparent that radio is used in its common meaning of AM and FM radio broadcasts.Statutory interpretation is broader than that single rule, though. Legislative intent is another important factor, and that is rather effective in eliminating absurd arguments. Via the link above, from New Mexico's State Court: words have their ordinary meaning 'as long as the ordinary meaning does not render the statute's application absurd, unreasonable, or unjust.' In other words, absurdity is so bad that the court will prefer an alternative interpretation of the offending words."}
{"question":"I live in France and I would like to know if it was legal to attack the Virtual Private Server I am renting in the US.","answer":"Consider that the provider doesn't know it's you that is attacking your own VPS, so they could start an investigation, which is expensive, and might also incur fines if they alert the police forcesSome attacks (DDOS for instance) will necessarily affect also other users, not only you.Bottom line, I'm definitely not a lawyer, but I'm pretty sure that if you don't have their permission, it's illegal everywhere.Ask your provider, and if he refuses to grant you permission, find a provider which specifically allows such a thing (I guess they must exist somewhere, after all, white hats must do some tests sometimes\u2026).Keep in mind that I think it's unlikely you'll find a VPS which allows such a thing, since you would risk crashing the whole machine, it's much more likely you'll end up needing a dedicated server."}

{"question":"Commonly, wireless printers in homes and corporate settings can be configured incorrectly, exposing them to the internet. This can be a major security vulnerability, and can allow anyone to not only print stuff remotely on it, but sometimes even get full access to the network it's connected to.If somebody happens to find a vulnerable printer online, and no contact information associated with it, would it be legal to print a message on it to let the owners know that it's vulnerable, and possibly even how to fix it?Edit:Usually, these printers are configured not to have any sort of password, or anything really, preventing access from anyone on the internet. The printer also has to be manually set up to allow access from the internet, so could that technically be considered permission to access the device?","answer":"This could be a violation of  (and a crime).

Also, the access must be &quot;without authorization or exceeds authorized access&quot;. The law doesn't explain with &quot;without authorization&quot; means, but the latter is defined asto access a computer with authorization and to use such access toobtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is notentitled so to obtain or alterIf the law were stated in terms of &quot;prohibited access&quot;, meaning &quot;express denial of permission&quot;, and if the computer owner had set the computer to &quot;prohibited access&quot; by default (password protected), there would be no issue -- accessing the computer is prohibited. &quot;Unauthorized&quot; can also mean &quot;has not been explicitly authorized&quot;, i.e. lacking any indication one way or the other. Every computer access is initially unauthorized, until authorization is granted; and re-trying a login after mis-typing a user name (and being denied access) is not a violation of this law.There does not appear to be case law that addresses the status of computers just left open to the public, and whether using a computer that is so exposed constitutes &quot;unauthorized access&quot;. Also, it is not clear that the defendant in this case has &quot;obtained information&quot;, since with printing, information flows into the computer. There is also a clause about recklessly causing damage, but I don't see what damage would result (&quot;damage&quot; is defined as &quot;any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information&quot;), and how printing would be &quot;reckless&quot;. It seems somewhat unlikely that this would be deemed to be a crime, though if you experiment, you could be on the cutting edge of new case law."}
{"question":"Can a Federal Actor, through the use of coercion, or by the omission of information, force a U.S. citizen to waive a state-given Constitutional right?Specifically: On the date of March 19, 2010, an amendment to the Ohio State Constitution was passed. Article 1 Section 21, \"Preservation Of The Freedom To Choose Health Care and Health Care Coverage:\"21 (A) No federal, state, or local law or rule shall compel, directly or indirectly, any person, employer, or health care provider to participate in a health care system. (emphasis mine) (B) No federal, state, or local law or rule shall prohibit the purchase or sale of health care or health insurance. (C) No federal, state, or local law or rule shall impose a penalty or fine for the sale or purchase of health care or health insurance.(D) This section does not affect laws or rules in effect as of March 19, 2010; affect which services a health care provider or hospital is required to perform or provide; affect terms and conditions of government employment; or affect any laws calculated to deter fraud or punish wrongdoing int he health care industry.The American Healthcare Act, or \"Obamacare\" did not go into effect until March 23, 2010. All Ohioans have this right. The problem is that all Ohio federal taxpayers must use Form 1040 to file their yearly taxes. Form 1040 for the years of 2014 through 2018 have Line 61, which requires the proof of acceptable health insurance coverage, a valid exemption from the coverage, or assess oneself with a penalty. If Ohioans have a right NOT to have to be compelled to acquire health insurance, then how could this form be constitutional in the State of Ohio? The use of force in this situation would be threats of fines for not filing taxes, while one is refusing to waive a state-given right.","answer":"Under Article VI of the United States Constitution,  This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.The Affordable Care Act is a law of the United States which was made pursuant to the United States Constitution. It is therefore the supreme law of the land, any Thing in the Constitution of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. Provisions that violate the federal constitution are invalid, but those are invalid no matter what state laws or state constitutions say. Federal power to preempt state law is basically absolute within the sphere of federal authority (and again, outside that sphere the federal action is unconstitutional no matter what states say).  This means the federal government isn't really forcing you to waive a state-given right. That implies you have a right to waive, but states can't give you rights enforceable against the federal government (there might be some narrow exceptions, but I can't think of any off the top of my head). States do sometimes pass laws or constitutional amendments claiming to overrule the federal government. They can do this, but these laws have no effect. Things get more complicated when the federal government is interfering with the actual operations of state governments, but the ACA regulates individuals."}

That site mightr be able to sue for breach of contract, but it probably would not do so. For one thing, the possible damages would seem to be small.If the profile is being used to falsely claim a US identity, or falsely claim the experience of the person whose name was used, the prospective employer might be able to sue or fraud, and include the person who lent his or her name as a co-defendant. But again, such an employer would be more likely to fire, or not hire, the impersonator than take legal action.If the false name and US status were used to try to obtain a more favorable tax treatment, that might well constitute tax fraud. The person who allowed his or here name to be used might be an accomplice or conspirator.I can't think of any other likely legal consequences."}
{"question":"Is it legal for a customer to use a  to turn off TVs in businesses, e.g. the ones playing sports channels in restaurants or the demo models in stores, without permission of the owner?","answer":"Trespass to chattelThe TV is owned by the store or restaurant. You are not allowed to use it or manipulate it. So you commit , which is &quot;the use of property without permission of the owner&quot; and a common law tort. To prove Trespass the store would need to show:You intended the trespass on the chattel, in this case, by turning off the TV. That can be proven by you owning the TV-B-Gone and using it.You deprived the owner's use of the chattel for a substantial time, which in the case of a sports bar might be any moment of the game, especially if the bar is allowed to run sports bets.in the case of the sports bet bar, you might even have created harm to something that the bar has a legitimate interest in.The Sports Bar might have the much easier case, while the store might not be able to prove the required deprivation of the chattel or damage caused by turning it off. Similarly, if a TV-B-Gone turns off a public CNN monitor at an airport though, you created harm because CNN would need to send a technician to turn it on again - the remote controls are only with the technicians, not in place. Do note that  many such displays are installed in shielded boxes, or have been modified to not register to remote controls at all. Most sports bars don't even have a TV there, it's a computer monitor that is fed from a stream.However, if it's store advertisements... I doubt you turning it off would have caused the substantial deprivation to qualify as trespass to chattel. And while TV-B-Gone is just a tort... Don't you dare to run a cellphone jammer:Well, Cell-Phone-B-Gone could be done, but it's illegal. One way to do it is to create a very low power fake cell transmitter, and the phone call would be gone. But disrupting a cell phone service is illegal in and of itself. - "}

{"question":"I wasn't sure if this is better for the site itself or for the meta site.

But the US entities without any physical presence or assets in EU-member countries appear to be outside of the de facto reach of GDPR.The US criminal justice system claims jurisdiction over any citizen of any country, but it does not de facto (rather than de jure) apply to the countries with no extradition treaties with the US.The best I can describe this situation is the way I did in the question's title.  The entities are outside of reach of those laws, but they are not outside of claim of reach of those laws.

{"question":"Just today, a man came partially up my driveway and into my yard with two dogs (on leashes). I asked him to please not allow the dogs to urinate in my yard, and he said he isn't in my yard. I have a stream that cuts it approximately 1\/3, and so I figured he was confused, but didn't want to get into an altercation so I let him be. He followed the creek past his fence, then crossed into his own yard. A family member went out on the porch to hear him raving (by their account) about how awful I am. I do not have much experience, but on hindsight he appears to have been highly intoxicated. He was here about a week ago and one of his dogs scared a family member, but there was no interaction between us.We have no \"no trespassing\" signs, but in the circumstances, can he be incriminated for third degree trespassing if he enters our yard again?EDIT: This is based on Georgia, United States law.","answer":"Once you asked the person to leave your property (if you did) and he refused, he was trespassing. Georgia Code 16-7-21 (b)(3) applies. If you had a fence and &quot;No trespassing&quot; signs, subsection (b)(2) would also have applied.If you did not ask him to leave, and there were no signs notifying him to do so, then he wasn't legally trespassing unless he did at least $500 worth of damage, which it does not sound as if he didIf you (being an owner or occupant) notify a person in some other way than by a sign not to enter a property, it is still trespass if that person then enters without lawful authority.In some US states, including Arizona, there are degrees of trespass, but as far as I could find there is no such thing as &quot;third degree trespass&quot; in Georgia.(See also )Once an owner, rightful occupant, or an authorized representative  of an an owner or rightful occupant asks someone to leave, they must do so (unless hey have some lawful authority to be present), and failing to do so is criminal trespass.One can call the police to deal with a criminal trespasser.According to :(a) A person commits the offense of criminal trespass when he or she intentionally damages any property of another without consent of that other person and the damage thereto is $500.00 or less or knowingly and maliciously interferes with the possession or use of the property of another person without consent of that person.(b) A person commits the offense of criminal trespass when he or she knowingly and without authority:(1) Enters upon the land or premises of another person or into any part of any vehicle, railroad car, aircraft, or watercraft of another person for an unlawful purpose;(2) Enters upon the land or premises of another person or into any part of any vehicle, railroad car, aircraft, or watercraft of another person after receiving, prior to such entry, notice from the owner, rightful occupant, or, upon proper identification, an authorized representative of the owner or rightful occupant that such entry is forbidden; or(3) Remains upon the land or premises of another person or within the vehicle, railroad car, aircraft, or watercraft of another person after receiving notice from the owner, rightful occupant, or, upon proper identification, an authorized representative of the owner or rightful occupant to depart."}
{"question":"So I just finished watching The Fugitive. At the end of the film Sam Gerard realizes that Kimble is innocentand takes him into custody. However, at that moment, in the eyes of the law, Kimble is guilty of murdering his wife.How would Dr. Kimble go about getting himself declared innocent?  He's already had a trial, so he can't be tried again for the same offense. He obviously needs to appeal, but on what grounds? The trial was conducted properly (we presume), the evidence that would clear his name simply hadn't been uncovered.","answer":"You can be tried again for the same offence; double jeopardy only applies if you are found 'not guilty'. It is not uncommon for appeals courts to invalidate a guilty verdict and require a retrial. Similarly a mistrial can result in a new trial at the prosecution's discretion. In addition, some jurisdictions have abolished double jeopardy for crimes like murder (e.g. New South Wales, Australia). New evidence coming to light can be grounds for appeal - in the case of the Fugitive where there have been no appeals this is one avenue open to Kimble.Where appeals have been exhausted; this is more problematic. One of the principles of justice is that there should be finality to the verdict. Kimble has gone from presumed innocent to presumed guilty - enough evidence would need to be gathered to demonstrate a clear and unambiguous miscarriage of justice. This may not be within the purview of the judicial branch of government - he may need a pardon from the executive.

I, their father, am a British citizen, their mother was a US citizen and we were not married.Between the birth of the first child and the second, their mother was granted indefinite leave to remain.At no point did their mother register their birth with any US authorities.Accord to the website of the US State Dept (bottom section on Birth Abroad Out-of-Wedlock to a U.S. Citizen Mother), both of my children qualify to apply for US citizenship.I am correct in my belief that they do not automatically have US citizenship?Note: I am not asking for advice in seeking US citizenship for them, merely confirming their current status.","answer":"Your children may have automatically become US citizens at birth, depending on how long their mother lived in the US before they were born.US law says that any child born abroad to an unmarried US citizen mother is automatically a US citizen, as long as their mother had lived in the US continuously for at least one year before the child was born.  There is a clear discussion of the legal requirements in . Your specific situation is covered by C.2: Child of a US Citizen Mother (also at the bottom of the page!).

{"question":"Give the legal adage \"innocent until proven guilty\", would a requirement by the state to overcome a presumption of guilt only by signing, under penalty of perjury, a \"declaration of non-responsibility\" form be considered illegal or unconstitutional?(The context is a traffic camera.)","answer":"In the US, the burden of proof in a civil case is distinct from that in a criminal case (it is true that in European systems, the plaintiff must prove their claims beyond reasonable doubt, but we're talking about US law here). The particular statute, , does somewhat favor the state as plaintiff, stating that the automatic camera evidenceconstitutes in evidence a prima facie presumption that the registeredowner of the vehicle was the person in control of the vehicle at thepoint where, and for the time during which, the violation occurred.The law further states thatThis presumption may be overcome only if the registered owner states,under oath, in a written statement to the court or in testimony beforethe court that the vehicle involved was, at the time, stolen or in thecare, custody, or control of some person other than the registeredownerwhich means filling out a form like . The form itself is plainly not illegal in any sense, the question is whether RCW 46.63.075 is in some sense illegal. This being a civil matter, guilt \/ innocence are irrelevant, and the burden of proof is not strongly on the plaintiff (the government). It is entirely legal for there to be a evidentiary presumption, as long as the presumption is defeasible. There could be a legal problem if it was impossible to satisfy the requirements for disproof, for instance if the condition was &quot;upon order from the US Supreme Court&quot;. A requirement to appear in Lester municipal court within 1 hour would be practically impossible to satisfy.A particular form might be &quot;illegal&quot; in the sense of not correctly stating the requirements of RCW 46.63.075, though again that just means that you have to appear in court to state the statutorily required fact rather than mailing in a form. That form seems to go somewhat beyond the requirement of the law in requiring all registered owners to sign the form when the statute refers to &quot;the registered owner&quot;, but state law allows vacillation between singular and plural in interpreting laws, if required to make sense.Bear in mind that RCW 46.63.075 only addresses the question of identifying the infractor, since in other moving infractions the officer can personally testify as to identity. You are still entitled to proffer other defenses such as that the camera does not prove that the alleged vehicle was involved. The one question worth considering is whether the form offers a false trichotomy, since there are other &quot;it wasn't me&quot; scenarios imaginable. For example, suppose you can prove that you were out of the country at the time and you don't know how the vehicle cam to be in that situation. You could check the &quot;stolen&quot; and &quot;under other's control&quot; boxes. There is no requirement that you additionally provide proof of the statement, you just have to make the statement.If you actually know that the car was not under the control of another (stolen or otherwise), signing the statement is criminal perjury. The state would have to prove that you knew that the statement was false, which they could do if they can prove through some other means that you were driving and if they can prove your state of mind (not sleep-driving, not having an alternative personality, not simply forgetful). You are correct that there is no requirement in Washington to know at all times who is driving your vehicle.The legislature deliberately passed a specific law that limits what would be an otherwise valid common law right to refute an argument for liability (to require the plaintiff to offer evidence). In addition, the legislature actually made it illegal for the government to provide better evidence out of privacy concerns, since under, the photo evidence cannot include the face of the driver."}
{"question":"In How To Get Away With Murder , a character saysIn Washington v.Davis, your predecessors decided that even if a law has a discriminatory effect, it is unconstitutional if that was not its intended purpose.Should this instead be any of the following:'if a law has a discriminatory effect, it is unconstitutional even if that was not its intended purpose''even if a law has a discriminatory effect, it is constitutional if that was not its intended purpose'?","answer":"Washington v. Davis held that if a law or other action (in this case, a Verbal Skill Test as part of D.C. police hiring practices) is not necessarily unconstitutional if it results in discriminatory outcome.

{"question":"Assume some legal question is brought up for a ruling by a US state supreme court.

The state supreme court makes a ruling and then the state executive and\/or legislative branches simply refuse to abide by that ruling.What now?Do any\/all of the the state judicial branches have any actual enforcement capability? Not just the legal authority to demand compliance, but the physical capability to act when someone defies that authority?Would the federal government have any power to intervene? Would they have to be requested to intervene? If so, whose request would suffice?Would public opinion play any role? Would it matter if the residents of the state are in opposition to or support of the court?Has anything like this ever happened?","answer":"This happened recently in Washington state, when the state Supreme Court ordered the state government to comply with a constitutional funding mandate (, 2012). The state did not comply for 6 years and was fined ($100,000 per day) for 3 years. I don't recall that the state paid a penny, and the courts did not demand payment of fines for that period. Public opinion did not have any obvious effect, but you could take this to Politics SE to get a lot of opinions as to whether public opinion mattered.The federal government can't get involved, unless they (the federal government) first make a federal issue out of it, perhaps because of some law suit. Power of enforcement is essential non-existent, given a sufficiently non-cooperative state government.I should point out that the court's order was a bit vague, that is, it was not &quot;release Smith from custody instantly&quot;, it required the government to act to the satisfaction of the court."}

Historically, there was also a sovereign immunity issue. I believe the canadidate you describe would get around the standing problem. Sovereign immunity has been waived for large swaths of IRS action.These three barriers (standing, sovereign immunity, mandamus not being applicable to discretionary decisions) are discussed extensively in in Howard W. Brill, &quot;&quot; (1983) Akron Law Review.But the writ of mandamus is simply not available to compel discretionary action (Brill, p. 348). Brill quotes from Work v. United States ex rel. Rives,  to describe the nature of mandamus:it is available to compell an officer to perform a &quot;purely ministerial duty&quot;&quot;It cannot be used to compel or control a duty in the discharge of which by law he is given discretion.&quot; the availability of mandamus:... relief in the nature of mandamus is not available:to compel the performance of a discretionary (as opposed to a ministerial) act or the manner in which a discretionary act is to be performedRegarding the Johnson Amendement, the choice to investigate\/audit and then the decision about whether and how to punish all seem to be discretionary action in its purest form. Others have also characterized enforcement of the Johnson Amendment as discretionary (Marty Lederman refering to &quot;&quot;)."}
{"question":"My wife and I are running into a bit of an issue. She currently works in the state of Nebraska as a leasing agent for apartment complexes. The way her company works is that she is paid as commission only, which since she works remotely is counted as an exemption from the minimum wage standard according to the FLSA (as I understand it).However, the way their system works is as follows. Every month, you are paid a base pay which is equivalent to renting six units.In other words, if you only rent four units that month, you are still paid for six.If you rent any more than six units, anything over those six is considered commission pay.So, if you rent seven units you are paid for your six as base pay, and then one more as commission.Now, this is where it gets a little sketchy in my mind. If you rent only four of the six that count towards base pay, the next month you now 'owe' the company two units, on top of the six that your base pay covers.Over the course of two years, my wife now 'owes' the company 9 units, however she is in the process of quitting. They are telling her that since she 'owes' them those units, they may require that she pays them money upon departure to compensate for them, since she was already paid for them through her base pay over the last two years.To me, this makes no sense. They paid her that money in the presumption that those units would eventually be rented. Not that she would compensate them in the event that they were not. It seems wrong to me that they could force her to return money that was paid to her during her employment. If they wanted to stop paying her all base pay until she actually left the company, I would understand that since it is their choice to give it to her. And for the remaining two weeks that she has left she would simply not see her base pay. However, to ask her to pay them back for money they already paid her seems like something that isn't or shouldn't be allowed. My question is: what is the legality behind what they are asking her; is she, by law, required to pay them back money they've already paid her?","answer":"If the employment contract treats base pay as an advance on future commissions when an employee has not earned the minimum number of units, then the company is probably entitled to repayment of advances not earned out. On the other hand, if it treats the base pay as a guaranteed minimum, the company would not be entitled to a refund. The specific wording of the contract will be vial here. There may also be state laws regulating such an arrangement. Under  commissions not earned when an employee leaves must be paid:  on the next regular payday following the employer's receipt of payment for the goods or services from the customer from which the commission was generated."}
{"question":"I'm curious, let's say that a prosecutor has taken a case before a grand jury. That grand jury has chosen to indict. Can the AG withdrawal those indictments? I've been trying to find , but I've had no luck. Edit: This would regard Federal crimes and the United States. ","answer":"Yes. The U.S. AG can decline to prosecute an indictment at any time until jeopardy attaches when a jury is sworn in to consider the charges at trial. The AG can also abandon a prosecution mid-trial but then cannot retry those charges later. The AG might abandon charges, for example, because the evidence does not appear to support the charges when presented at trial, or because, for example, a prosecution might damage a diplomatic relationship of the U.S. with another country, or because a new administration has different priorities than an old one and recently had its AG appointed to office while the trial was pending.This said, there are some situations (e.g. when there is a special prosecutor, or after a lower level prosecutor has entered into a binding plea agreement) when the AG does not have the authority to overrule the decisions to prosecute or not prosecute an indictment that is made by a lower level prosecutor. The AG has line authority to give orders to lower level prosecutors in the AG's office 99% of the time, but not always."}
{"question":"In the U.S., is it illegal (\"anti-trust\") to deliberately operate a business at a loss by providing services priced to steal customers from competition?Assume there is a projection of future earnings that would recover the losses incurred in the process by increasing the prices once most competition has been driven out.","answer":" which is the main U.S. federal government agency charged with administering federal anti-trust laws:Can prices ever be &quot;too low?&quot; The short answer is yes, but not veryoften. Generally, low prices benefit consumers. Consumers are harmedonly if below-cost pricing allows a dominant competitor to knock itsrivals out of the market and then raise prices to above-market levelsfor a substantial time. A firm's independent decision to reduce pricesto a level below its own costs does not necessarily injurecompetition, and, in fact, may simply reflect particularly vigorouscompetition. Instances of a large firm using low prices to drivesmaller competitors out of the market in hopes of raising prices afterthey leave are rare. This strategy can only be successful if theshort-run losses from pricing below cost will be made up for by muchhigher prices over a longer period of time after competitors leave themarket. Although the FTC examines claims of predatory pricingcarefully, courts, including the Supreme Court, have been skeptical ofsuch claims.Q: The gas station down the street offers a discount program thatgives members cents off every gallon purchased. I can't match thoseprices because they are below my costs. If I try to compete at thoseprices, I will go out of business. Isn't this illegal?A: Pricing below a competitor's costs occurs in many competitivemarkets and generally does not violate the antitrust laws. Sometimesthe low-pricing firm is simply more efficient. Pricing below your owncosts is also not a violation of the law unless it is part of astrategy to eliminate competitors, and when that strategy has adangerous probability of creating a monopoly for the discounting firmso that it can raise prices far into the future and recoup its losses.In markets with a large number of sellers, such as gasoline retailing,it is unlikely that one company could price below cost long enough todrive out a significant number of rivals and attain a dominantposition.Most (if not all) states also have parallel state anti-trust laws which sometimes prohibit conduct that is not prohibited by federal anti-trust laws, although the overlap between the two is substantial."}
{"question":"My question is the title, the rest is just an explanation. I'm a student at Penn State University in the US. Is it illegal for me to show course material to a public audience like on my YouTube channel? When I was in High School I always wondered how difficult college assignments would be and how they would look, so now I want to kill that curiosity for others by showing the entire class' assignments etc. etc. and stuff. To my knowledge I don't know of anyone who's done that except for outdated content like from the 1800s that no one cares about anymore.So, is it illegal for me to share course content online?","answer":"Generally no.  Displaying a large part of the contents of a textbook might be an infringement of the copyright on that text, unless permission was obtained. But showing how a particular class lesson would work does not seem likely to infringe any copyright. If the teacher has written out a detailed script for a lesson, then copying the words of that script might be infringement, but paraphrasing them would not be.I might add that I have seen quite a few broadcast classes on television -- it used to be a not uncommon if specialized genre, pre-internet. I don't know if it has been done on YouTube, but I would be surprised if it has not.If this would be under US law than &quot;educational purposes&quot; are one of the core reasons for fair use.

{"question":"I have been wondering for quite a while now about the following question and have been unable to get a definitive answer. I have asked lawyers who do not know for sure (and this is their field). My question is if a User of some Service can be held liable for a legal infringement that the Service commits. That sentence was a bit confusing, so let me explain\/elaborate:In the case of Kazaa (I think it was called), a file sharing service, some users were held liable for the illegal downloading of music from this service. The users had to pay horrendous fines for in essence using the services which facilitated these actions. I am not sure if the Users signed a contract that says that they are liable for (knowingly or unknowingly) illegally downloading music from the Service. If a contract was signed, then that would definitely justify the fines to the Users, not the Service.Here is a theoretical example: A company sells a service which allows users to mask their IPs so that it seems that they are in the continental US. A user, 'Bob Doe', is using this service. The user does not have to sign any contracts or sign their consent to anything. This user attempts to use an unaffiliated service which is only available in the continental US (and a couple other places) and prohibits its use outside of it (a service such as this one is Netflix, I think). Bob Doe uses Netflix in Uzbekistan (definitely not a place where Netflix is available) through the first mentioned service that masks his IP. Is Bob Doe held liable for any legal complications resulting from his use of Netflix through the IP masking service or is the IP masker shielding him too (is this IP masking service held liable)?I have also heard the argument that the User is causing the Service to commit an illegal act, hence the User is responsible (even though no contract was signed by the user).My question basically is: If a User does not sign a contract saying that they are held liable for any illegal act which they 'cause the Service to commit', then who is held liable; who has to pay the fines?Thanks a lot for any responses! All are welcome and greatly appreciated!","answer":"It is unlikely that you find a commercial provider of a service such as the one you describe that does not require its users to consent to some kind of agreement.The service provider, in spite of the absence of a contract, is unlikely to be held liable or named as a defendant in proceedings unless it can be shown that they ought to have been aware of the activities being undertaken.If it is found that the service provider reasonably ought to have been aware, and could have taken steps to prevent the activity, they could possibly be named as a defendant, in addition to or instead of the end user.See A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (2001) for a court decision with a similar fact pattern involving copyright infringement, rather than contract breach. It is also unclear whether such a case would be tried in the US, though it is likely.The end user is likely to be in breach of Netflix's Terms of Use (relevant clause extracted below); in this case, Netflix would have to sue for breach of contract, and it is quite likely that judgement would be in their favour. The possible damages awarded would vary by jurisdiction.Essentially - yeah, the user is almost certainly going to breach contract.

{"question":"ContextI am a British citizen and for a little while have been collecting antique (section 58) firearms in the UK.

I have been selling my collection in the UK to British citizens to try and get rid of it before I emigrate. I am not a registered business, I am a private collector who buys and sells in small amounts (approx. \uffe1600 annually).I know UK firearms law for sales within the UK well. I Have read the antique definitions in US law and know my items are antiques in both countries, (although as both countries have poorly-informed customs and law enforcement, it is always useful to know what would happen if antiquity was disputed). I do not know any US law about international sales inside other countries such as registration or citizenship.IntentionI will be leaving the antique guns with my parents in the UK (who will continue to treat them as curios\/ornaments under section 58). The guns would remain advertised on a UK website for UK sales only. They would be boxed and wrapped and my parents would arrange a courier or royal mail them (my parents will not require any UK license to transfer antiques as a curio or ornament).Said guns would not be leaving the UK because then I might need a USA Export License. (I know the reverse is true - if I stood in the UK causing guns to leave the USA and go to anywhere else - for example, there was an RFD dealer prosecuted for negotiating a gun sale exported from China to Nigeria, without having a UK Export License)RequestsIs there any US or UK law which stops me continuing to advertise my guns for sale on a UK website, in the UK, within the UK, to UK citizens?Additionally, I wish to know: If they were NOT antique guns, what US requirements would I need to be negotiating UK-UK sales while living in the USA? I am aware I would need to be an RFD or have other certification as a UK citizen, I ask regarding US law.

{"question":"Mr. X has been convicted of stealing $1 million, sentenced and ordered to pay restitution. What is the status of his estate under the following scenarios:1) Mr. X has spent all the money and is broke. He can't possibly pay the $1 million. When he gets out of jail and (presumably) starts working again, how much of his income can he keep, and how is 'excess income' assessed toward the $1 million debt?2) Mr. X has a house worth $1 million with a mortgage of $1 million (a civil liability). I have been told that a criminal judgment takes precedence over a civil liability. Is it true, as my friend asserts, that the $1 million crime victims will get their money before the mortgagee after the house is sold?3) Mr. X has a house worth $2 million with a $1 million mortgage, and $1 million of equity. Is there anything (e.g. taxes) that will stand in the way of the house being sold, $1 million being paid to reimburse the crime victims, and $1 million to the mortgagee? Put another way, what is the order of reimbursment between victim, mortgagee, and other claimants such as taxes?","answer":"First of all, there is more than one legal sense in which the term a person's 'estate' is used. You are using it in the archaic sense of all of the property owned by a living natural person, but this is not a contemporary use of the term. Normally, the term estate is referred to property that belongs to a dead person that is subject to probate, the property that belongs to a trust, or the property that was transferred to a bankruptcy trustee by operation of law upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition. None of those modern senses of the word apply to this question. You are just asking about the extent to which a particular kind of debt (criminal restitution) can be collected from the person who owes that debt.Your tag also implies that you are particularly interested in New York law. The probate laws of the State of New York are codified in a portion of its statutes known as the EPTL (Estate, Powers and Trusts law), but as noted above, that is not relevant in this case. The criminal law provisions related to restitution, and the general rules applying to debt collection (spread across several of New York's statutes such as the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law (RPAPL), the New York Penal Law, and the Civil Procedure Laws and Rules (CPLR)) are the laws applicable to your subquestions.  1) Mr. X has spent all the money and is broke. He can't possibly pay  the $1 million. When he gets out of jail and (presumably) starts  working again, how much of his income can he keep, and how is 'excess  income' assessed toward the $1 million debt?This involves the liability of Mr. X and not 'his estate'. If he goes bankrupt this debt would not be discharged if the proper procedural steps are taken.In general, restitution judgments can be enforced by the procedures set forth for collection of a civil judgment and also through the terms of any relevant probation or parole conditions (which would typically allow for incarceration for willful failure to comply with the conditions to the extent that Mr. X is able to do so with minimal due process protections).Civil judgments can be enforced through garnishment of amounts owed to you (such as bank account balances and wages) subject to certain exemptions from creditors (only some of which apply to restitution judgments) and through writs of execution against property owned by you (the process is quite different for tangible personal property v. real property). The general rule is that wages are exempt from creditors up to an amount equal to 30 hours times minimum wage or 75% of the total whichever is greater. There is usually no exemption for income as an independent contractor, businessman or for bank accounts (unless fully traceable to certain exempt assets).Certain kinds of property (there is a long list) are exempt from creditors as well (although certain kinds of assets are exempt as against some but not other creditors).  2) Mr. X has a house worth $1 million with a mortgage of $1 million (a  civil liability). I have been told that a criminal judgment takes  precedence over a civil liability. Is it true, as my friend asserts,  that the $1 million crime victims will get their money before the  mortgagee after the house is sold?This is also a claim against Mr. X and not his estate. Your friend was incorrect. A mortgage is a property interest that takes priority over an unsecured debt like a restitution judgment even if that debt may have special priorities in some circumstances. (This assumes that the mortgage is recorded before a 'judgment lien' is recorded in the real property records of the county where the house is purchased or is recorded contemporaneously with the purchase of the house. If a judgment lien is recorded and then a mortgage is entered into and recorded later, the judgment lien would have priority.)  3) Mr. X has a house worth $2 million with a $1 million mortgage, and  $1 million of equity. Is there anything (e.g. taxes) that will stand  in the way of the house being sold, $1 million being paid to reimburse  the crime victims, and $1 million to the mortgagee? Put another way,  what is the order of reimbursment between victim, mortgagee, and other  claimants such as taxes?To grossly oversimplify a complicated process with a variety of exceptions:The highest priority would be any outstanding liens for unpaid property taxes,Then sometimes all or part of a homeowner's association lien, then the first mortgage, then any other other liens junior to the mortgage that are not subject to a homestead exemption of CPLR Section 5206, because the homestead exemption was waived or to which it does not apply by law (e.g. mechanic's liens for work done on the property but not paid for and second mortgages),then the homestead exemption amount (paid to Mr. X) which in New York ranges from $75,000 to $150,000 depending upon the county in question which remains exempt for one year if kept segregated or reinvested in a new home (twice as much if the debtor is married), then judgment liens paid in order of recording which were recorded prior to the restitution judgment lien. The property interest in the house associated with judgment liens or other mortgages recorded after the restitution judgment lien foreclosed upon that burden the property (i.e. junior liens) are erased in a foreclosure, subject to a right of redemption set forth in in RPAPL Section 1352:  Sec. 1352.     JUDGMENT FORECLOSING RIGHT OF REDEMPTION.    Where real property has been sold pursuant to a judgment in an action  to foreclose a mortgage, and an action is thereafter brought to  foreclose or extinguish a right of redemption in such real property,  the judgment, instead of directing a sale of the property, shall fix  the right of any person having a right of redemption therein or the  right to foreclose a subordinate mortgage or other lien and shall  provide that a failure to redeem or commence an action for the  foreclosure of such mortgage or other lien within such time shall  preclude such person having a right of redemption or the holder of  such mortgage or other lien from redeeming such property or  foreclosing such mortgage or other lien, and thereafter such person  having a right of redemption or the holder of such mortgage or other  lien shall be excluded from claiming any title or interest in such  property and all title or interests of such person having a right of  redemption in, or the right to foreclose a subordinate mortgage or  other lien against such property shall thereby be extinguished and  terminated.The claims would be paid out of the proceeds of a sheriff's sale net of the costs of sale. If there is money left over after all of these claimants are paid, it would go to the property owner, Mr. X. But, in your scenario with a $1 million mortgage and a $1 million restitution lien and a $2 million value, there would be no excess. If a properly bid sale price is not enough to pay the entire restitution judgment, the shortfall called a 'deficiency' remains as a 'deficiency judgment' that is still owed by Mr. X.Strictly speaking, the higher priority liens don't get paid from the sales proceeds (except the owner's homestead exemption amount), instead the foreclosure sale buyer takes the property subject to those liens and those senior lienholders have a right to foreclosure in turn if they are paid off.Also, procedurally, the value of the property net of higher priority liens and encumbrances is determined by the highest bid made at a sheriff's sale (with the foreclosing debtor allowed to use the amount of the lien as payment), not on the basis of an appraisal or prolonged sale via a realtor. Often there will be no bidder other than the creditor bringing the foreclosure.APPENDIX:Criminal restitution in New York State is primarily governed by N.Y. Penal Law Section 60.27 which reads as follows:  Restitution and reparation      In addition to any of the dispositions authorized by this article, the court shall consider restitution or reparation to the victim of  the crime and may require restitution or reparation as part of the  sentence imposed upon a person convicted of an offense, and after  providing the district attorney with an opportunity to be heard in  accordance with the provisions of this subdivision, require the  defendant to make restitution of the fruits of his or her offense or  reparation for the actual out-of-pocket loss caused thereby and, in  the case of a violation of section 190.78, 190.79, 190.80, 190.82 or  190.83 of this chapter, any costs or losses incurred due to any adverse action taken against the victim. The district attorney shall  where appropriate, advise the court at or before the time of  sentencing that the victim seeks restitution or reparation, the extent  of injury or economic loss or damage of the victim, and the amount of  restitution or reparation sought by the victim in accordance with his  or her responsibilities under subdivision two of section 390.50 of the  criminal procedure law and article twenty-three of the executive law.  The court shall hear and consider the information presented by the  district attorney in this regard. In that event, or when the victim  impact statement reports that the victim seeks restitution or  reparation, the court shall require, unless the interests of justice  dictate otherwise, in addition to any of the dispositions authorized  by this article that the defendant make restitution of the fruits of  the offense and reparation for the actual out-of-pocket loss and, in  the case of a violation of section 190.78, 190.79, 190.80, 190.82 or  190.83 of this chapter, any costs or losses incurred due to any adverse action, caused thereby to the victim. In the event that  restitution or reparation are not ordered, the court shall clearly  state its reasons on the record. Adverse action as used in this  subdivision shall mean and include actual loss incurred by the victim,  including an amount equal to the value of the time reasonably spent by  the victim attempting to remediate the harm incurred by the victim  from the offense, and the consequential financial losses from such  action.  Whenever the court requires restitution or reparation to be made, the court must make a finding as to the dollar amount of the fruits of  the offense and the actual out-of-pocket loss to the victim caused by  the offense. In making this finding, the court must consider any  victim impact statement provided to the court. If the record does not  contain sufficient evidence to support such finding or upon request by  the defendant, the court must conduct a hearing upon the issue in  accordance with the procedure set forth in section 400.30 of the  criminal procedure law.  The provisions of sections 420.10, 420.20 and 420.30 of the criminal procedure law shall apply in the collection and remission of  restitution and reparation.  For purposes of the imposition, determination and collection of restitution or reparation, the following definitions shall apply:  (a)   the term 'offense' shall include the offense for which a defendant  was convicted, as well as any other offense that is part of the same  criminal transaction or that is contained in any other accusatory  instrument disposed of by any plea of guilty by the defendant to an  offense. (b)  the term 'victim' shall include the victim of the  offense, the representative of a crime victim as defined in  subdivision six of section six hundred twenty-one of the executive  law, an individual whose identity was assumed or whose personal  identifying information was used in violation of section 190.78,  190.79 or 190.80 of this chapter, or any person who has suffered a financial loss as a direct result of the acts of a defendant in  violation of section 190.78, 190.79, 190.80, 190.82 or 190.83 of this  chapter, a good samaritan as defined in section six hundred twenty-one  of the executive law and the office of victim services or other  governmental agency that has received an application for or has  provided financial assistance or compensation to the victim. A victim  shall also mean any owner or lawful producer of a master recording, or  a trade association that represents such owner or lawful producer,  that has suffered injury as a result of an offense as defined in  article two hundred seventy-five of this chapter.  (a)    Except upon consent of the defendant or as provided in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, or as a condition of probation or  conditional discharge as provided in paragraph (g) of subdivision two  of section 65.10 of this chapter, the amount of restitution or  reparation required by the court shall not exceed fifteen thousand  dollars in the case of a conviction for a felony, or ten thousand  dollars in the case of a conviction for any offense other than a  felony. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, if an  officer of a school district is convicted of violating any section of  article one hundred fifty-five of this chapter where the victim of  such crime is such officer's school district, the court may require an  amount of restitution up to the full amount of the fruits of the  offense or reparation up to the full amount of the actual  out-of-pocket loss suffered by the victim, provided further that in  such case the provisions of paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall  not apply. (b)    The court in its discretion may impose restitution or  reparation in excess of the amounts specified in paragraph (a) of this  subdivision, provided however that the amount in excess must be  limited to the return of the victim's property, including money, or  the equivalent value thereof; and reimbursement for medical expenses  actually incurred by the victim prior to sentencing as a result of the  offense committed by the defendant.  Any payment made as restitution or reparation pursuant to this section shall not limit, preclude or impair any liability for damages  in any civil action or proceeding for an amount in excess of such  payment.  In the event that the court requires restitution or reparation to be made to a person and that person dies prior to the completion of  said restitution or reparation, the remaining payments shall be made  to the estate of the deceased.  The court shall in all cases where restitution or reparation is imposed direct as part of the disposition that the defendant pay a  designated surcharge of five percent of the entire amount of a  restitution or reparation payment to the official or organization  designated pursuant to subdivision eight of section 420.10 of the  criminal procedure law. The designated surcharge shall not exceed five  percent of the amount actually collected. Upon the filing of an  affidavit of the official or organization designated pursuant to  subdivision eight of section 420.10 of the criminal procedure law  demonstrating that the actual cost of the collection and  administration of restitution or reparation in a particular case  exceeds five percent of the entire amount of the payment or the amount  actually collected, as the case may be, the court shall direct that  the defendant pay an additional surcharge of not more than five  percent of the entire amount of a restitution or reparation payment to  such official or organization, or the actual cost of collection or  administration, whichever is less unless, upon application of the  defendant, the court determines that imposition of such additional  surcharge would cause undue hardship to the defendant, or any other  person who is financially supported by the defendant, or would  otherwise not be in the interest of justice. Such additional  surcharge, when added to the initial five percent surcharge, shall not  exceed ten percent of the amount actually collected.  If the offense of which a person is convicted is a class A, class B, class C, or class D felony involving the sale of a controlled  substance, as defined in article two hundred twenty of this chapter,  and no other victim who is a person is seeking restitution in the  case, the term 'victim' as used in this section, in addition to its  ordinary meaning, shall mean any law enforcement agency of the state  of New York or of any subdivision thereof which has expended funds in  the purchase of any controlled substance from such person or his agent  as part of the investigation leading to such conviction. Any  restitution which may be required to be made to a law enforcement  agency pursuant to this section shall be limited to the amount of  funds expended in the actual purchase of such controlled substance by  such law enforcement agency, less the amount of any funds which have  been or will be recovered from any other source, and shall not include  a designated surcharge pursuant to subdivision eight of this section.  Any law enforcement agency seeking restitution pursuant to this  section shall file with the court and the district attorney an  affidavit stating that funds expended in the actual purchase of a  controlled substance for which restitution is being sought have not  been and will not be recovered from any other source or in any other  civil or criminal proceeding. Any law enforcement agency receiving  restitution pursuant to this section shall promptly transmit to the  commissioner of the division of criminal justice services a report  stating the dollar amount of the restitution received.  If the offense of which a person is convicted is defined in section 150.10, 150.15 or 150.20 of this chapter, and no other victim  who is a person is seeking restitution in the case, the term 'victim'  as used in this section, in addition to its ordinary meaning, shall  mean any municipality or volunteer fire company which has expended  funds or will expend funds for the purpose of restoration,  rehabilitation or clean-up of the site of the arson. Any restitution  which may be required to be made to a municipality or volunteer fire  company pursuant to this section shall be limited to the amount of  funds reasonably expended or to be expended for the purpose of  restoration, rehabilitation or cleanup of the site of the arson, less  the amount of any funds which have been or will be recovered from any  other source, and shall not include a designated surcharge pursuant to  subdivision eight of this section. Any municipality or volunteer fire  company seeking restitution pursuant to this section shall file with  the court, district attorney and defense counsel an affidavit stating  that the funds reasonably expended or to be expended for which  restitution is being sought have not been and will not be recovered  from any other source or in any other civil or criminal proceeding.  For the purposes of this subdivision, 'volunteer fire company' means a  fire company as defined in paragraph a of subdivision two of section  one hundred of the general municipal law.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, when a person is convicted of harming an animal trained to  aid a person with a disability in the second degree as defined in  section 195.11 of this chapter, or harming an animal trained to aid a  person with a disability in the first degree as defined in section  195.12 of this chapter, the court, in addition to any other sentence, shall order the payment of restitution to the person with a disability  who was aided by such animal.  If the offense of which a person is convicted is defined in section 155.25, 155.30, 155.35, 155.40 or 155.42 of this chapter, and  the property taken is timber, the court may upon conviction, in  addition to any other sentence, direct the defendant to pay the  rightful owner of such timber an amount equal to treble the stumpage  value of the timber stolen as defined in section 71-0703 of the  environmental conservation law and for any permanent and substantial  damage caused to the land or the improvements thereon as a result of  such violation. Such reparations shall be of such kind, nature and  extent as will reasonably restore the lands affected by the violation  to their condition immediately before the violation and may be made by  physical restoration of such lands and\/or by the assessment of  monetary payment to make such restoration.  If the offense of which a person is convicted is defined in section 240.50, subdivision one or two of section 240.55, section  240.60, section 240.61, section 240.62 or section 240.63 of this chapter, and no other victim who is a person is seeking restitution in  the case, the term 'victim' as used in this subdivision, in addition  to the ordinary meaning, shall mean any school, municipality, fire  district, fire company, fire corporation, ambulance association,  ambulance corporation, or other legal or public entity engaged in  providing emergency services which has expended funds for the purpose  of responding to a false report of an incident or false bomb as  defined in section 240.50, subdivision one or two of section 240.55,  section 240.60, section 240.61, section 240.62, or section 240.63 of  this chapter. Any restitution which may be required to be made to a  victim pursuant to this subdivision shall be limited to the amount of  funds reasonably expended for the purpose of responding to such false  report of incident or false bomb, less the amount of any funds which  have been or will be recovered from any other source and shall not  include a designated surcharge pursuant to subdivision eight of this  section. Any victim seeking restitution pursuant to this subdivision  shall file with the court, district attorney and defense counsel an  affidavit stating that the funds reasonably expended for which  restitution is being sought have not been and will not be recovered  from any other source or in any other civil or criminal proceeding,  except as provided for by section 3-112 of the general obligations  law.  Where a transfer of probation has occurred pursuant to section 410.80 of the criminal procedure law and the probationer is subject to a restitution condition, the department of probation in the county in  which the order of restitution was imposed shall notify the  appropriate district attorney. Upon notification by the department of  probation, such district attorney shall file a certified copy of the  judgment with the clerk of the county in the receiving jurisdiction  for purposes of establishing a first lien and to permit institution of  civil proceedings pursuant to the provisions of subdivision six of  section 420.10 of the criminal procedure law.

{"question":"I am currently trying to obtain a German passport, my mother is German and therefore I have a right to citizenship. However, German citizenship laws say that you can lose German citizenship if you apply and choose to take up another passport.I obtained a U.S. passport while I was a minor, because my father held a U.S. passport and I was a legal U.S. resident, therefore I was .I have spoken with the German embassy in London (I am also British, by birth), and provided all relevant documents and they confirmed with me my eligibility for a German passport, however they require proof of how\/when I obtained my U.S. passport to prove that it does not contravene the aforementioned policy about obtaining new citizenship.That's where I'm having some trouble, I need documentation to prove that I obtained citizenship while still a minor. I became a U.S. citizen quite close to my 18th birthday so my passport issue date fell after my 18th birthday. I don't  have any documentation from the process of getting my U.S. citizenship, so I'm at a loss of how to get the documents I need.I looked up the process on the USCIS website, and it looks like a form N-600 would have been submitted. Is there some way I could get a copy of it from the government, or is there another document that would be able to provide the proof I need?Update:If there is a way to prove when I received my green card, that might also suffice. As with that information I could prove that on that date I fulfilled all of the criteria to be automatically a U.S. citizen.","answer":"  and it looks like a form N-600 would have been submittedNot necessarily. If you were a permanent resident under 18 living in the US with a US citizen parent, you automatically became a US citizen, and thereafter you can apply for a US passport directly without getting a Certificate of Citizenship first. Many people who derived US citizenship as permanent resident minors just get US passports and never bother to shell out the $1,170 fee to file N-600 for a Certificate of Citizenship.If you could prove that you were a US permanent resident before you turned 18 (e.g. a copy of your old green card, or I-485 approval, or entry stamp on an immigrant visa) and met all the conditions for automatically deriving US citizenship, that could technically prove that you became a US citizen before 18, but I am not sure whether German authorities would be willing to basically adjudicate a complicated area of US nationality law, so I am not sure they would accept such evidence.If all else fails, you may have to file N-600 to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship (paying the huge fee) now if you had never gotten one (or get a replacement by filing N-565 if you had gotten one) because that is the one thing that will definitively state when you became a US citizen."}
{"question":"I was born in the U.S. to non-american parents.  We moved out of the country a year later and never returned to the U.S.About 20 years later, I applied for a new passport from the consulate in my country and told them I have no Social Security Number (SSN) and swore under oath.  A few weeks later I got my passport.Now I am scared because my parents might have gotten me an SSN when I was born but they don't remember.  I just found out now that I can give my info to the Federal Benefits Unit (FBU) serving my country (this happens to be in the embassy of another country for my case) and figure out if I ever had one.I also need to get a SSN to open a bank account (even in my country), get a job, etc.But I'm scared either option might get me into trouble if I did indeed have a Social Security Number.","answer":"You have not committed a crime or a violation of non-criminal law when you swear something under oath believing in good faith that what you are saying is true, and you are mistaken. The law does not expect omniscience.Also, making a false statement under oath is only sanctionable if you make a false statement of a &quot;material fact.&quot; Whether or not you have a Social Security number is not a &quot;material fact&quot; in the context of a passport application where the material facts are that you are the same person as the person described in your birth certificate, that the parents there are to the best of your knowledge your parents, that the birth certificate is authentic, and that you have not renounced U.S. citizenship. The question about a Social Security number is there for administrative convenience, not to make any determination about your right to a passport.You should apply for a Social Security number. If you already have one, your actions consistent with not having one will only corroborate the fact that you were ignorant of that fact when you applied for a passport, and you will have your existing Social Security number provided to you.As a practical matter it is unlikely that you have one. There are no forms that your non-U.S. parents would have to be filled out that would have required one, and you know that you haven't applied for one in the past.

The legislative session is scheduled to end Wednesday and Cuomo has threatened to bring lawmakers back to Albany into special session every day if they adjourn without at least extending the existing law.So, how can a governor tell people that a law, which expired, will continue to be enforced (it's no longer current law), and how can the New York State legislature \"backdate\" a law, given  of the US constitution?","answer":"There is a relevant  about how ex post facto is defined in the United States.Not all law is about crime, and that includes NY rent control laws; violating them does not lead directly to a criminal prosecution, hence a sufficiently strict definition of ex post facto cannot apply to them.  And such a sufficiently strict definition has been the explicit one since 1798, when the Supreme Court ruled in  ('law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal [...] law that aggravates a crime, makes it greater than it was [...] law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime', etc.).Notice that , making it clear that this rule does not apply to tax law.I would assume in this case the intention is to retroactively extend the old law, i.e., if the old law expired on the 15th and the extension passes on the 20th, that extension will be retroactive to the 15th.  If the extension then continues until a new law is in place, there will be no time period under which one or the other did not apply.  Despite the wording in the news article, I do not think the intention is to make the new law retroactive, only the extension of the old one, for the simple reason that the legislature would never agree to pass such a brand new law later and no matter what it contains say it will be retroactive back to the original expiration date of a law it replaces even after they already extended that until there was a new law.  That is borderline non-sensical. The Daily News blurb certainly makes it sound like it might be that way, but I think this is a bit of intentional obfuscation -- the way in which a partial quote is used in the first paragraph is indicative, and the Daily News is, well, the Daily News."}

Whether you can install a camera in a particular place depends on who owns that place. Of course, you also can't aim it to peer into a nearby residence; and it has to be a video-only camera (unattended recording of audio is illegal without the consent of the thief). In some cases, mega-boxes are owned by the USPS so you would need USPS permission. There is a widespread false narrative that the USPS owns all mailboxes, but the USPS does not say that nor does the US Code. USPS describes , private and USPS-owned.

{"question":"Can a Federal Judge make findings that substantially affects the property interests of third persons who are not and never were before the court {no action commenced against them, and no process) during the course of criminal sentencing proceedings directed at defendant parties in that case?And if there is no authority for making such a finding, what would be the remedy where the Court ordered the property of the other persons to be sold, again without issuing service to said persons?","answer":"A court can have jurisdiction over property in rem without personal service upon all persons who may claim an interest in the property.Typically, this is done by providing some form of service (such as notice by mail) upon people who are known to have an interest in the property, and an alternative to service directed at an individual (such as notice by posting at the property, by publication of a notice in a public place, or by publication of a notice in a newspaper where the property is located).Civil forfeiture often involves this kind of indirect notice to unknown parties by publication.what would be the remedy where the Court ordered the property of theother persons to be sold, again without issuing service to saidpersonsThe ruling of the criminal court is not binding on people who were not served with process in the original action (either personally, if known, or by publication or some other similar means, if not known to the court) in another legal proceeding. But if a claim becomes moot, there may be not remedy available of a violation of one's rights.They could conceivably bring an action to quiet title, or the equivalent, or an action in replevin, which would not be bound by the Court's findings since the third-parties weren't a party to it, and an injunction on the sale could be sought in that case, if it wasn't too late.But, if the third-parties had actual notice of the pending criminal action, the better option would probably be to file a motion in the criminal action to intervene with respect to disposition of the property.Takings of property  are not &quot;takings&quot; in the 5th Amendment constitutional sense, for which an inverse condemnation action are available, although there is still a due process requirement, which isn't met without some effort to give potential known or unknown third-party claimants notice of the sale.If there was a court ordered sale, any claim would probably be against the proceeds of the sale, and not against a bona fide purchaser for value at a court ordered sale regularly conducted.Of course, this presumes that the property is not contraband (you can't make a legal claim to cocaine even if you own it).If the defendants did not give you notice of your ownership interest, and this resulted in you not being able to intervene in the criminal action, you could also sue the defendant for breaching duties owed to you as a fellow property owner of the property disposed of in the criminal action.Ultimately, this is not an enviable position to be in, and the likelihood of a court effectively destroying your property interest in the property subject to the criminal proceeding in a manner that there is no economically efficient remedy to address is significant.Some of the relevant case law is discussed at .One of the leading U.S. Constitutional law cases on the topic is Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984) (For intentional, as for negligent deprivations of property by state employees, the state's action is not complete until and unless it provides or refuses to provide a suitable post-deprivation remedy.)."}
{"question":"Automotive enthusiasts like to outfit their motor vehicles with aftermarket accessories that increase the performance and capabilities for specific purposes. This could include high performance cars, work trucks, 4x4 vehicles, ect. Many of these aftermarket parts and accessories do not meet motor vehicle safety standards and are not approved by any authority for use on highways.These parts can either be manufactured and bought from various retailers. They could be custom ordered to fit. They could be designed, built, and installed by a local specialty auto shop or the owner of the vehicle.These aftermarket parts could include:Roll cage - A protective structure, usually built from chromoly or mild steel tubing, meant to protect all occupants of the vehicle during a roll-over accident. This could directly affect crumple zones required by motor vehicle safety standards that are meant to absorb energy during a collision.Custom bumpers - A common upgrade to vehicles that allows mounting of a winch for recovery purposes. Commonly constructed using cold rolled mild steel plate. This also could directly affect crumple zones required by motor vehicle safety standards that are meant to absorb energy during a collision.Steering and suspension - Common upgrade that increases stability, durability, and safety. Usually changed or modified to accommodate other upgrades, and can significantly change the characteristics of the vehicle and increase payload.Roof-top tent - A tent usually mounted to the roof of the vehicle, or on a rack mounted above the bed of a pickup truck, made of either hard plastic or vinyl. This could directly affect the stability of the vehicle and raise the center of gravity, therefore possibly exceeding motor vehicle safety standards.Some states have passed laws that make it a crime to operate a motor vehicle that is \"in violation of state or federal motor vehicle safety standards.\"For the purpose of federal safety standardsIf an individual purchased a new vehicle, and outfitted it with aftermarket parts that are not certified under any motor vehicle safety standard, would their vehicle be in violation of U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety Standards?Would the driver be subject to criminal charges under state statute?","answer":"In Washington, there is no criminal sanction for installing an &quot;aftermarket&quot; product on your vehicle. If we are speaking of non-commercial vehicles, the penalties for violating the various safety regulations is a ticket.The federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards can be consulted  is the bumper prohibition. The rule prohibits manufacture or importation of a car or a part that doesn't meet the standard. Subsection (b) addresses the &quot;then added later&quot; question, generally saying that there is little prohibition against you tweaking your car. First, if you &quot;had no reason to know, by exercising reasonable care, that the vehicle or equipment does not comply with the standard&quot;, you are not subject to penalty. Usually, people have absolutely no reason to know that some part is unsafe, which is not the same as non-compliant, but you might pick up a really cheap bumper having been told that it is cheap because it totally ignores the applicable standards: then you would have reason to know. Used cars and parts are not subject to any federal scrutiny.The concept of a &quot;vehicle in violation&quot; is a legal misconception. Certain acts violate, objects do not violate. The chokepoint that controls car parts is the &quot;manufacture or sell&quot; part of the law, which prevents Auto Zone from selling you a bumper made of clay (it does not prevent you from installing such a bumper \u2013 unless your state has a specific law to that effect). The shop is in violation, not the customer."}
{"question":"The  (which establishes NATO) commits each member to mutual defence in case any member is attacked. The treaty has been ratified by the US, so it is legally binding.My question is, can the US government be legally forced to honor this? For example, if hypothetically a NATO country is attacked and the US refused to help (for some reason, e.g. it has an isolationist President or it doesn't want to escalate the conflict into a world war), can someone go to a US court and make it force the US government to do it? For example, the court might achieve this by making people in the government go to jail if or pay a lot of money they don't do it.","answer":"First, the practical answer is no: even if they ordered the President to go to war, the President can just refuse. The military is generally in the habit of listening to orders from the President, particularly if the question is 'do we or do we not go to war;' the courts do not have the power to command the armed forces. They could try issuing an injunction instructing the military to go to war, but the injunction would be ignored. They could try holding people in contempt, but the President is in charge of almost all federal law enforcement (and can pardon criminal contempt), so that's not going to work. And even if the President could be punished for contempt, if he thinks intervening will result in the annihilation of the human race in a thermonuclear war, he will not issue the orders. But that's assuming the courts would even try to intervene. They wouldn't. Courts don't generally want to issue orders that they know will be ignored. In this case, the relief being sought (i.e. an order to do something) is a kind of relief that is up to the discretion of the court. So even if a court would be legally justified in issuing that order, they have an easy out. (For damages claims, Congress can just refuse to appropriate any money to satisfy them; no federal money can be spent unless Congress appropriates it).There's an even earlier out, though. Courts are not political branches of government; one of the basic rules of jurisprudence is that courts should not get involved in deciding something that's really up to the elected branches. Baker v. Carr had a list of factors to consider:a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department;a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it;the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion;the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due  coordinate branches of government;an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made;the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.Foreign relations in general is very often grounds for deference, as is military strategy. Courts are utterly unqualified to determine proper diplomatic or military actions to take, or to evaluate whether the President's actions were enough to meet the requirement of 'do what's necessary to restore security;' foreign policy is a case where a country needs a unified face (because other countries aren't particularly willing to deal with US internal politics), and where the courts could easily screw up what the government is doing; and whether to send Americans to war is a question that is clearly a matter for those accountable to the people. So, federal courts cannot analyze this question to decide whether or not the government has done anything wrong; it's for the other two branches to decide."}
{"question":"There's a story going around the Internet of an activist donating posters to Texas schools with an Arabic translation of \"In God We Trust\". The claim is that Section 1.004 of the Texas Education Code (as updated by SB 797) mandates schools to display these posters, as they display 'the United States national motto, \"In God We Trust\"' (and also comply with the other requirements of the law).I looked up the source of this being the national motto, and it's 36 U.S. Code 302, which simply says:In God we trust is the national motto.The activist, and media reporting about it, seem very certain that this translation complies with the text of the law referred to above, but I can't find any further explanation about why. Is there any case law that corroborates the implicit claim that sentences in these kind of laws should be interpreted as referring to those sentences or a translation of those sentences into another language, instead of to simply those sentences as rendered in the law, in English?","answer":"Are Texas schools required to display posters with an Arabic translation of &quot;In God We Trust&quot;?No. The activist (Chaz Stevens?) not only misses the legislative intent behind the motto, but it actually would be a violation of the Establishment Clause if a government displayed the flags he donated.Is there any case law that corroborates the implicit claim that sentences in these kind of laws should be interpreted as referring to those sentences or a translation of those sentences into another language, instead of to simply those sentences as rendered in the law, in English?In the particular case of &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, the legislative intent is very specific about the language in which the motto is to be displayed. See :It will be of great spiritual and psychological value to our countryto have a clearly designated national motto of inspirational qualityin plain, popularly accepted English.(emphasis added, citing House Report No. 1959. 1956 Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 3720).The legend in the activist's flags is in Arabic, and therefore not in plain, popularly accepted English.The activist's purpose would violate the Establishment Clause because the legend in the activist's flag is less religion-neutral than the national motto. The transliteration of the . Neutrality would require the legend to be nakhnu nathaq bi-(a)l-ilahi ( ??? ??? ?????), since ilah means [a] god.Although &quot;God&quot; in uppercase and used as proper noun is attached to judeo-christian theology, this religious bias is historically perceived as rather negligible when compared with the practicality of inspiring &quot;patriotism&quot; and akin values. See, for instance, Aronow at 243 and n.2. Similarly, :a reasonable observer, aware of the purpose, context, and history ofthe phrase &quot;In God we trust,&quot; would not consider its use or itsreproduction on U.S. currency to be an endorsement of religion.Linguistically, the activist's legend even alters the emphasis of the national motto. By starting with nakhnu (which means &quot;we&quot;), the import of the legend is that &quot;We, not others, are the ones who trust Allah&quot;. By contrast, the national of the motto connotes an emphasis on the noun &quot;God&quot;, not on &quot;we&quot;. To preserve the emphasis the national motto makes, the activist's legend should have been bi-(a)l-ilahi nathaq or something close thereto."}
{"question":"What's to stop counterparties to a contract from later marking up their copy with changes and forging initials, or swapping signature pages from one contract to another?   Context here is executing will of relative, who owned commercial rental property.  On file with accountant and bank, I have seemingly clean printed original signed copies with two signatures.And from one tenant I have marked up copies with changes very favorable to them (scratching out scheduled rent increases in future years, property tax increase allocations, and payments for shared utilities). Tenant says he never would have signed the original lease.  Are the latter documents part of the back and forth during negotiation?  Or did decedent grant concessions without telling bank? (Bank required those clauses for the financing).(Of course am consulting a real attorney, with actual documents, etc.  Just my curiosity is getting the better of me in meantime.)","answer":"Normally with a signed contract both parties get a copy as signed by both parties. That will be the canonical binding agreement. All parties are assumed to check that both copies are the same before they sign.If a draft of the contract was used to negotiate over then it's common practice to print out a new contract with the agreed upon changes and sign that.If after signing a new agreement is negotiated then a new contract should be made referencing the old one.If I were to make a ruling over this I would say that the tenant made the alterations to his copy after it was signed and rule that the agreement is as laid out in the clean copy.

{"question":"I generally understand that 'natural' people are living human beings and 'artificial' \/ 'legal' people can be private entities \/ corporations. I know artificial people can be given some of the same rights as living human beings. What rights are corporations actually given? What was the purpose and law that created this concept?Is it possible for a 'natural' person to get the benefits of an 'artificial' person?","answer":"Legal persons include (subject to particular jurisdiction):natural persons,cooperatives,corporations,unincorporated associations,partnerships,companies (which includes corporations but can also be trade unions, unlimited companies, trusts, limited liability companies)sovereign states,some international organisations (e.g. the UN, the EU),temples,the Whanganui River in New Zealand and the Ganges River in India.Non-natural legal persons or persona ficta in Latin date from Roman times and their use was popularized by Pope Innocent IV in Catholic canon law because it allowed monasteries to own infrastructure while the monks could maintain their vows of poverty.In common law tradition only a person could sue or be sued because only a natural person could be guilty as only they had a soul. Prior to the industrial revolution this was not a problem as most businesses were conducted by individuals or small partnerships. However, with the rise of limited liability corporations, wronged parties couldn't sue the corporation (because it wasn't a person) nor could they sue the directors\/shareholders because their liability was limited only to the value of their shares (which had usually already been paid).  To resolve this issue, a legal person was created with 5 legal rights, the right to:a common treasury or chest (i.e. the right to own stuff),the right to a corporate seal (i.e. the right to enter contracts),the right to sue and be sued,the right to hire agents (employees and contractors),the right to make by-laws (i.e. corporate governance).Latter the courts added the rights and obligations of a citizen and\/or resident of a sovereign state.A natural person already has all of these rights and obligations."}

{"question":"I am asking for someone dear to me. This will be a hypothetical example. Hypothetically, if a 19 year old male (living overseas, say in Turkey) sexts\/exchanges nudes with a female who says she is 18 (living in the US) and then it turns out that she lied about her age and she's 16 or 15, for example, and 2 years later her parents discover about this sexting and decide to take legal action against the person living overseas, what could be done? (Assume that there's no screenshots of when she lied about her age and said she's 18)Would he be extradited? And under which jurisdiction? I have contacted an expert on online security and he said that less than 1% of domestic cybercrime is prosecuted, and that international cybercrimes very rarely get prosecuted, except for fraud, because there's a lot of 'serious offenders' overseas. But I still would like the opinion of people well-versed in law please. Assume it happened on a fake Facebook account or the Kik app for instance. As you know, there's a lot of scams like this but my question assumes that the situation isn't a scam. So for the sake of example, please assume that there is no scam and that the situation is 100% real. Would you tell this guy to calm down, or that he should wait till the statue of limitations (7 years I guess) for this kind of thing is over, for example? He is legitimately considering hanging himself because his parents live in the US and he doesn't want his mom to see him behind bars for something he did 2 years ago. I talked him out of hanging himself recently and told him that nothing is going to happen and he should breathe easy. But he's genuinely afraid and keeps getting paranoid. If you have noticed, I keep posting here about related subjects trying to find answers for this guy. He contacted a lawyer who basically said that the chances he will be prosecuted are slim but not impossible. This even made him more paranoid. It could be a scam and it could be a 50 year old man who lied and said he's an 18 year old female, but I want to take a worst case scenario to calm my friend down and tell him the worst consequences possible. (Assume he owns the router and Wi-Fi connection but the rent is registered with another family member's name)Thank you. ","answer":"There are several elements working in your friend's favor. The first is 'guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.' In an entrapment case, the police have recordings or documents claiming that the 'girl' was underaged. If there is no such smoking gun from the (real) girl, the case (probably) would not be prosecuted in the U.S. He doesn't have to prove that she told him she was 18; 'she' (or the police) has to prove that she told him she was 'not.'The second factor is 'remoteness' in time, and distance. Two years after a U.S. state sent me a 'nasty letter,' I asked my lawyer if the state would ever come after me. He answered, 'If they were going to do this, you would have heard further by now.' The other factor, distance and cross border, (three countries: Turkey, the U.S., his home country) further militates against prosecution except for highly aggravating circumstances such as drug dealing, gambling, or sex for pay. A third factor is that your friend would not come close to qualifying as a 'serious offender.' This would be someone like a drug dealer, or the head of a 'call girl' ring. The cops concentrate their effects on big 'busts' like this that make their careers, not 'small fry' like your friend. But of course they use the publicity from the big catches to scare everyone else.While there is no 'guarantee' against 'the worst possible consequences,' the chances of them happening are similar to his getting hit by lightening, and less than his chances of being hit by a car crossing the street. No one stresses out about those chances. He shouldn't either.I am not a lawyer but I have done paralegal work in a law office."}

For example, if the accused had already started to present their defence, based on the understanding that they were charged with X, but in doing so they hampered a potential defence with respect to not-yet-charged Y, it would likely be an injustice to amend the indictment to charge Y. Usually, the amendment is to alter the particularization of the charge (e.g. broadening the charge from an assault of a specific individual to an assault of a &quot;female person&quot;: R. v. Ferguson-Cadore, ).But there is also limited case law suggesting it is okay to swap in an entirely new charge (R. v. Bidawi, 2018 ONCA 698; R. v. Irwin (1998) : &quot;I see no useful purpose in absolutely foreclosing an amendment to make a charge conform to the evidence simply because the amendment will substitute one charge for another&quot;).So, the final convictions do not need to be a subset of the initial indictment, but where there is a deviation, it is because a subsequent amendment has been made.<h3>Lesser included offences<\/h3>There is also the possibility that one would be convicted of a &quot;lesser included&quot; offence. The indictment is understood to include offences that are lesser included offences (s. 662). E.g a charge for aggravated assault includes the possibility of conviction for plain assault even if not explicitly stated."}
{"question":"Based on the example of  there's something about freedom of speech that's puzzling me:According to the article and to what I've read about the case, a defendant in court has been denied the right to even say that what he did was legal under state law. In my personal opinion this looks like an outright violation of freedom of speech, because I can't think of any reason why a defendant should be in any way restricted as to what he is allowed to say. Being allowed to say anything doesn't force anyone (judge\/juror) to believe that it's true and obviously there're good reasons for example to force witnesses to only say the truth, because their freedom of speech quickly conflicts with the defendant's right for a fair trial should they be allowed to lie.I'd like to know the explanation for this as I'm sure there is one, though it's not obvious for an 'outsider' like me. Besides that, I wonder if this has ever been challenged in court.","answer":"A courtroom is not a podiumA court is a forum for resolving a specific dispute. Testimony is restricted for a number of reasons the most all encompassing of which is relevance.For testimony to be admitted it has to go to the issue in dispute. For a person charged under the laws of, say, India, it cannot be in any way relevant what the laws of, say, China have to say about the issue. Similarly, for a person charged with a Federal crime, state law is irrelevant (and vice-versa).There is no free speech issue here because testimony is given only for the purpose of resolving the case. If it's not relevant to that you can't introduce it and, if you persist in trying the court can hold you in contempt."}

{"question":"Is there any legal issue with a property management company employing a journeyman plumber to do plumbing jobs in house?The management company only manages related party owned properties, specifically one spouse owns a management company which manages for properties owned by companies owned by one spouse or the other.To play Devil's advocate, I'd argue that this makes the management company essentially a plumbing contractor, and as such it has to be owned by a master plumber in order to hire a journeyman. That said, we would not be offering plumbing services to the public.On the other hand, I would argue that the journeyman is licensed to do the work he is doing as an independent contractor and it would be routine for a management company to hire an independent contractor and pass the bill along to the property owner, so the only real difference is paying as an employee vs paying as a contractor.I'd appreciate any guidance to get me started, but I understand this is likely state specific. The state is Montana.","answer":"Yes, if the management company has a plumbing contractors licencePlumbing is specialist work under the  and a person (including corporations) who perform such work for the public must hold a current contractor's licence (s12).

{"question":"Is it an act of discrimination when the employer rejects your job application, given that you a) belong to a protected group and b) can demonstrate experience in all the essential job functions (as described in the job description) using the previous projects you have done, as much as it's possible objectively? For instance, the job description says 'must have experience working with X, Y and Z' and you can prove that you have a lot of experience working with X, Y and Z.If not, why?","answer":"As an interviewer and a hiring manager, I can safely say that you can be rejected for a position for many reasons, even if you meet all the criteria - there may simply be someone better than you that they have also interviewed.Being rejected when meeting the criteria does not necessarily mean you were discriminated against, and in order to successfully claim discrimination you would have to show that you were rejected for a discriminatory reason.  Very few companies hire the first candidate that they interview who has the relevant skills and experience - I have interviewed probably 60 candidates in the past 12 months for several positions, and we generally interview at least 5 or 6 candidates per position before making a decision.  We do not, and would never consider just hiring the first candidate who interviews that meets the criteria.  Some of the people we reject are of protected classes and also met the criteria - but that doesn't mean we discriminated against them, they just weren't the best candidate we interviewed.Being of a protected group and having the relevant skills and experience does not guarantee you the job, it just 'guarantees' (in quotes because thats the intention of the law, and reality may differ - hence why discrimination cases do happen) that you cannot be rejected on the basis of the protected group.  If you were rejected because of the protected group, and you can show that (including obviously thin reasons such as withdrawing a position and then advertising it again the next week), then thats discrimination. If you were rejected for any other reason, then that does not necessarily constitute discrimination.  You could easily meet all of the criteria, have excellent experience but still come across as a candidate who would be difficult to manage (argumentative, lack of self-motivation, lack of attention to detail etc etc etc) and thus be rejected.  It's not all about simply meeting the criteria, which is why we interview rather than hire on the basis of someones CV and qualifications."}

Why not leave the appeals court's ruling on the record, because it is always possible a future president will try to block users while communicating with a personal social media account? Now if the issue pops up again in the future, a president will be allowed to block users for multiple years while the issue gets re-litigated from scratch.","answer":"The Supreme Court has a lot of things they can do in theory, but in reality, there are only two options the Court likely considered:One was to simply dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted due to neither party being significantly affected by the outcome of the case, as they did in Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi v. IndyMac MBS.The second was to vacate the lower court ruling and remand with instructions to the lower court to dismiss the case. That is what they did in this case.Why not leave the appeals court's ruling on the record, because it is always possible a future president will try to block users while communicating with a personal social media account? Now if the issue pops up again in the future, a president will wrongly be allowed to block users for multiple years while the issue gets re-litigated from scratch.That was their other option. The most obvious explanation for why they didn't pick that option is that the Supreme Court explicitly wanted this result, likely because at least some of them don't agree with your characterization that they would &quot;wrongly be allowed&quot;.I suspect what's going on here is that there is nobody to challenge this ruling in an adversarial situation. So the Supreme Court doesn't want a piece of precedent that resulted only from the administration being changed and would prefer that if there's going to a precedent-setting case on this, that it be aggressively litigated.So essentially, they didn't want this on the books because it wouldn't get appealed and they weren't convinced it was decided correctly."}
{"question":"I've had a bit of a dispute recently with the Maryland state comptroller over the comptroller's handling of communication regarding a past income tax filing and I'm wondering what legal recourse I have and whether it's worth pursuing, given the relatively small amount of money that is at stake. Here is the story:In 2011 I moved to a new address, both my old address and new address are in Maryland. I filed my 2011 taxes using the Maryland i-file system, which is like a free online turbotax for state taxes. In September and again in November of 2014, the state sent me a letter to my old address notifying me of an audit which found a mistake that I had made in filing my taxes (note again that I used the Maryland i-file system to file taxes that year). Note also that my 2011 taxes as well as all of my subsequent taxes were filed from my new address where I have been living since May of 2011. So these letters did not get to me until December when my tennants that are living at my former property gave them to me. After several phone calls and emails with various departments of the comptroller, I came to understand that the comptroller wanted $600 in taxes plus a $60 penalty fee and around $200-300 in interest (at the ridiculous rate of 13% anually). I sent a request on April, 22 of 2015 for the penalty fee and interest to be forgiven, which received an automated acknowledgement, but was never responded to. Now, a few weeks ago on May 5, 2016 someone finally contacted me to remind me of my debt and after exchanging several e-mails has agreed to forgive the $60 penalty fee but is unwilling to forgive any of the interest. I believe that the interest dating back to at least September of 2014 should be forgiven as well. At this point the total bill has grown to about $950 with interest, which I finally decided to just pay to avoid further interest.","answer":"Can you sue?  .In this story, if you wanted to dispute such a small amount, you should have done so before paying it.

Examples of such non-contractual agreements include social agreements, statutory duties, memorandums of understanding, agreements to distribute cocaine etc.However, that's not what you have hereNo contract agreements for things like internet or phone services are contracts - the no contract terminology is advertising fluff to indicate that the contracts are one-off or short term and don't lock the customer into a long-term contract.

{"question":"If someone knows an American politician that is currently holding office well enough that they could schedule a dinner and bring a guest, is it legal for them to offer to set up a meeting with the politician for money?I'm assuming that the politician doesn't receive any of the money and is unaware of the exchange and is only aware that so-and-so is coming to dinner.Let's assume the politician and the bribe-taker are just friends, so we're just considering the most general case.","answer":"Probably not illegal and definitely not a &quot;bribe&quot; in the sense of criminal bribery (which must involve some official action or refraining from official action).Access can be legally conditioned on payment of money in many cases, even though it can't be for the politician's personal (as opposed to his or her campaign fund's) benefit. (I don't rule out the possibility that there are some exceptions that are not legal but none come to mind at the moment.)Arguably the friend arranging the meeting is an unregistered lobbyist and so it might be a technical violation of that law by the unregistered lobbyist, and that technicality, if present, might render the contract unenforceable by either party in a court of law. But assuming that this takes place in a jurisdiction that doesn't require lobbyists to register it probably isn't illegal, and assuming that the payment is made and the access is given without complaint, the legality of the contract is irrelevant.As a practical matter, this kind of access for money is usually done as a campaign contribution incentive by the candidate or an affiliated campaign fundraising entity. Lobbyists who try to arrange contacts with politicians usually work on flat monthly retainers in exchange for their best efforts, rather than on a fee for service basis."}

I understand that Washington is a two-party consent state, yet I vaguely remember recording laws differentiating on federal property. Is there such an exemption for school property as well?

I am in the Bellevue School District, Washington State, United States.","answer":"The nature of the meeting matters: I assume this is a private meeting, not a public meeting. Under , 57 P.3d 255, which gives weight to the subjective intent of the parties, thus the primary question would be whether the school official intended the communication to be private. Given strong FERPA privacy protection of personal information about students and in light of the likely nature of the conversation, one might think that the administrator intends the discussion to be private. However, the administrator cannot discuss e.g. disciplinary issues with third parties, so that would not be a valid basis for expecting privacy. You would really need to get a lawyer, discuss the expected subjects with the lawyer, and see if there is a reasonable expectation of privacy (even if this is not a public meeting). Your local ACLU chapter might advise you of your rights, though they would probably also advise you to not experiment with breaking the law (I don't see what legitimate purpose would be served by recording in secret)."}

{"question":"There are numerous useful apps, software programs, web applications, browser plug-ins, etc., that have been produced by individual programmers.  Are these programmers exposing themselves to personal liability risks by making their tools available to the public?  For example, consider a hypothetical case where an individual programmer in the US has developed a web-based service that is used for business.  Unbeknownst to the programmer, there is a bug in the code.  The bug surfaces when a user attempts to use the service, costing the user a large sum of money because the service failed due to the bug.  How likely would it be for the developer of the service to be found liable for the damages that the user of the service incurred, if the user of the service attempted to sue the developer?  Does the answer depend on whether or not the developer charges for the use of the service?","answer":"YesContractIf a developer charges for a program they have a contract. Common law implies terms into contracts that the goods and services provided will be merchantable (that is suitable for sale) and fit for purpose (that is they do what the provider says they do or that the customer specified).

To prove negligence the recipient must show:The developer owed a duty of care to the userThey failed in that dutyAs a result of that failure the user suffered harm that was reasonably foreseeable to the owners.All of these are fact dependent.

{"question":" says that it may be possible that an NDA can exist such that if someone were to sell their company, can they can have an NDA that prevents them from speaking about their company name, the buying company's name, and details about what their company does. Would it be possible to find out any of these details as a third party despite the NDA? For example, I've heard that one can look up if an LLC existed for 3 years beyond the LLC's closure.","answer":"If the seller of a company signed an NDA, that NDA would make it illegal for them to tell you whatever the NDA covers (except there may be legal requirements that would override an NDA).That doesn't mean you cannot find out in any other legal way. For example, the company's accountant most likely knows a lot of things, and if they didn't sign an NDA, they may be free to tell you. Obviously the government will know things, as you said, the company had to be registered, the sale had to be registered, and you can't just close a company down and make it disappear. Especially since any obligations of the company will continue to exist for many years.Say the company in question bought office furniture from you and was supposed to pay in 60 monthly installments.

{"question":"Sales persons are sometimes advertising their service as 'contract free', so that they would get a better chance to convince you to sign up for their service. I guess the reason why this works is because to average person 'contract free' typically means that you don't have to read fine print on a written contract that most of the time works against you.However, isn't this misleading advertising to claim that there is 'no contract', because there always will be a contract - either verbal or written on a paper under different title (e.g. Application Form, 'Unicorn tears')? Based on answer I received  that the terms don't need to explicitly be mentioned in the first place, if price (and possibly late fees) were omitted from contract, then judge will figure out what is fair.What would judge do if you were able to prove that other party claimed that their service is 'contract free'?If sales person was honest would he have to explain to the other party that 'contract free' actually means:You know our service is only 'written contract fee' and not 'contract free'. However, this is the exact reason why you would have to be really dumb to enter into business with us orally or just via Application Form, because now instead of just dealing with the fine print issue that you would have had with written contract, now you will also have to deal with  issue where we can incorporate terms and conditions from Application Form into our website or somewhere else; also, now instead of knowing what are the exact fees (e.g. ETF, late fees) that we would charge from you we will simply charge whatever we think is 'fair amount'. If you disagree with the amount of fees we charge, then no worries judge will decide what is fair for you. However, remember, just because that we did not disclose such fees in contract it  does not mean that we can't charge them from you.Does monologue from 'honest' sales guy above really explains how our legal system works, if there is 'no contract'? Note that this question is only asked from legal point of view and not from building good relationship point of view.I will wait for multiple answers before accepting the right one. I will give preference to that answer that will be backed up with precedent case where judge discusses meaning of 'no contract'.","answer":"There are contract free transactions; they are called gifts. When one person provides consideration to another with no legal entitlement to consideration in return; when you give money to the Red Cross, for example.Alternatively, people can make reciprocal promises without the intent for those promises to be legally binding; that is, enforcement is by honor alone.

If this is not the type of arrangement you are thinking of then the legal term for it is 'scam' or 'con'.

{"question":"It is important to note that naked short selling is not alwaysevidence of intent to manipulate prices. Under certain circumstances,a market maker may engage in naked short selling to stabilize themarket. For example, assume that there is a sudden flurry of buyorders for a stock. The market maker may judge the buying interest tobe temporary and not justified by any real news about the company'sprospects. It may be the result of a questionable press release or arumor in an Internet chat room. The market maker may choose to sellshort to avoid what in its view would be an unjustified run-up in thestock's price. In this situation, naked short selling by the marketmaker may protect investors against manipulation.I am wondering under what circumstances this would be considered legal. Is there a law that states exactly what are these circumstances under which naked short selling would be legal under U.S. laws? I thought naked short selling was always illegal no matter who and why they did it.","answer":"Note the linked EveryCRSReport page does not say that naked short selling remains legal, it merely says that it may not be fraudulent or abusive.However, not all &quot;naked&quot; short selling violates SEC rules or is illegal or deceptive. In particular &quot;market makers&quot; are permitted to take actions that would not be allowed to others.  Beyond that, if the seller is in fact able to &quot;cover&quot; the short sale, and was not deceptive, there may be no violation.So let us look at a more official source.  is an official DEC page on the regulation, It explains the history of the regulation, and summarizes the specific rules that make up Regulation SHO.The page reads:Although the vast majority of short sales are legal, abusive short sale practices are illegal. For example, it is prohibited for any person to engage in a series of transactions in order to create actual or apparent active trading in a security or to depress the price of a security for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of the security by others. Thus, short sales effected to manipulate the price of a stock are prohibited.Naked short selling is not necessarily a violation of the federal securities laws or the Commission's rules. Indeed, in certain circumstances, naked short selling contributes to market liquidity. For example, broker-dealers that make a market in a security generally stand ready to buy and sell the security on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price, even when there are no other buyers or sellers. Thus, market makers must sell a security to a buyer even when there are temporary shortages of that security available in the market. (citation omitted)...Rule 203(b)(1) and (2) \u2013 Locate Requirement. Regulation SHO requires a broker-dealer to have reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due before effecting a short sale order in any equity security.  ...(citation omitted)Rule 204 \u2013 Close-out Requirement. Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[8] to take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of like kind and quantity. ... If a participant has a failure to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. ... Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as threshold securities, if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days...Selling stock short without having located stock for delivery at settlement. This activity would violate Regulation SHO, except for short sales by market makers engaged in bona fide market making. Market makers engaged in bona fide market making do not have to locate stock before selling short, because they need to be able to provide liquidity. However, market makers are not excepted from Regulation SHO's close-out and pre-borrow requirements.Selling stock short and failing to deliver shares at the time of settlement. Rule 204 requires firms that clear and settle trades to deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale in any equity security by the settlement date or to take action to close out failures to deliver by borrowing or purchasing securities of like kind and quantity ...Selling stock short without having located stock for delivery at settlement and failing to deliver shares at the time of settlement. This activity may violate Regulation SHO's locate and close-out requirements, as explained above. In addition, in fall 2008 the Commission adopted Rule 10b-21, referred to as the naked short selling antifraud rule. Those who deceive about their intention or ability to deliver securities in time for settlement are committing fraud, in violation of Rule 10b-21, when they fail to deliver securities by the settlement date.Selling stock short and failing to deliver shares at the time of settlement with the purpose of driving down the security's price. This manipulative activity, in general, would violate various securities laws, including Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act."}

While this video is on a commercial channel it's quite evident that guy did it for educational purposes. ","answer":"But he doesn't even sing!'If music only consisted of lyrics, you'd have a point. But you already said exactly how the infringement happened: playing the guitar.The content usage is clear: the video uses the song's melody, and therefore is infringing on copyright.It doesn't matter how long or little is played. Copyright infringement suits have been successful when only seconds of the original work were copied, because that short section is important enough to require protection, and its use to deserve compensation (in the extreme, because it comprises the entire work).  While this video is on a commercial channel it's quite evident that guy did it for educational purposes.If done for commercial purposes, this is almost surely the deciding factor over others in USA fair use, and clearly disallows UK fair dealing, and in most other jurisdictions would tend to make it disallowed usage as well.Put more simply, you can't justify infringing copyright in the material used for teaching when you're getting paid for that teaching, any more than you can justify theft of real or tangible property on the same basis."}

Or in your case perhaps a software distributor has requirements. In those cases, sure, you need to comply with these types of laws in every country. But as for the US, what are they going to do to you?EDIT to address comment: This is all just my opinion: there is no private right of action under COPPA so it is not an individual who would sue you but the state; a state's attorney. So you would have to get on their radar and they would need to decide to come after you. Then they have to find you, in Brazil, and file the lawsuit which they can do in their own jurisdiction. Then they have to serve you, in Brazil. You can go to the US and defend yourself or take the default judgment. If you lose you can see the penalties and the factors on that FAQ page. Best advice is to do your best and if threatened fix the holes. Oh yeah - some states have their own private right of action laws so you could be sued under a state law."}

What is relevant is that he was supposed to fix a device of yours, and damaged it in the process. Usually you have the right to get your device back undamaged, and fixed, so it is most likely that the store is responsible for fixing your computer free of charge, this time properly. Anti-hacking laws most likely don't cover this, because what he did wasn't unauthorised. He was authorised to fix the problem, including by fixing some software, so breaking your computer while trying to fix it isn't unauthorised hacking into your computer. "}
{"question":"Does the government have to compensate the money one could have earned while on trial? For example: Jim is a full-time employee at a gas stop in the US, and is paid minimum wage. He is the only source of income for his wife and three kids. Suddenly, police officers trace a dead body back to his garbage can, and he is taken into custody. He is not able to post bail, and since he does not have the funds to hire a decent lawyer to defend him, the government provides him a third-rate lawyer, he is indicted and the trial lasts five months. The verdict is not guilty, and Jim is released. Is Jim entitled to compensation by the for the salary he would have earned had he not been on trial?","answer":"Most U.S. states provide zero compensation of any kind in this situation, although there are a few states that are exceptions. (Far more states provide compensation from conviction to release for a wrongfully convicted person.) Even in those few states that provide compensation to acquitted defendants, the compensation is typically set by statute and is frequently much less than what a middle class person would earn and certainly does not capture the full extent of the defendant's economic loss."}
{"question":"I have been wondering that since a train company owns its locomotives and train cars, then I am assuming that this means that they own any graffiti that has been painted on their locomotives and train cars.I have recently read that it is illegal for someone to put graffiti on any train company equipment, since it is an act of vandalism, so this makes me think that that any graffiti artist(s) who created graffiti on train equipment cannot get a copyright(s) on the graffiti that they put on train equipment.If the graffiti thus belongs to the train company, then I am assuming that this means that the train company automatically owns the copyright(s) to this graffiti, and they would thus be free to take photographs of this graffiti and could display and\/or sell these photographs to the general public, if they wanted to do so.Is it legal for a train company to create an art gallery using photographs of the graffiti on their locomotives and train cars?","answer":"NoYou are conflating two different ownership concepts: the art in which the copyright exists, and the artwork that is the expression of the art (my terminology).The artist owns the art, the train company owns the artwork.Copyright exists in an artistic or literary work as soon as it is fixed in a tangible form and the author is the owner of that copyright. The owner of the artwork is the person who owns the substrate that the expression is made on. So if I write a novel on your paper or computer, then I own the copyright in the novel, you own the physical paper or Word document.It doesn't matter if I have your permission to use those things or not. If I don't have your permission then what I did might be illegal and lead to my arrest or you seeing me for damages but I still own the copyright. It would be an interesting question to consider if the State could seize my copyright under proceeds of crime legislation but that's beyond the scope of this question.So, no, the train company cannot take photographs of the art and publicly display it. They can take photographs of their trains, which would incidentally contain the art, and display those. There's a line there that a court would have to find should it ever come up.They can display the trains as an art display because they own the artwork. They could even cut the vandalised parts off the train and display those. What they can't do is copy the art."}
{"question":"According to  from the White House they state:the United States is to put in place new safeguards to ensure thatsignals surveillance activities are necessary and proportionate in thepursuit of defined national security objectivesWhat does that mean? Isn't that a cart blanche to track anything and anyone on the whim of what anyone sees as a threat?You criticize something? OK, potential threat.You ask a question: OK, potential threat.You post this question: OK, sketchy person.etc.I'm?not trying to be hyperbolic but history has shown quite often that national security objectives has a rather wide interpretation; not the least when it comes to non-US citizens.Anyone know what safeguards and legal standing EU citizens has in this deal?Is there any article \/ reports or the like that judge what the deal entails, i.e. from a critical viewpoint?","answer":"The statement says thatThe new Framework marks an unprecedented commitment on the U.S. side to implement reforms that will strengthen the privacy and civil liberties protections applicable to U.S. signals intelligence activities.That at least claims to be a restriction on surveillance, not an increase in authorization for surveillance.  The statement also says that the US will:establish a two-level independent redress mechanism with binding authority to direct remedial measures, and enhance rigorous and layered oversight of signals intelligence activities to ensure compliance with limitations on surveillance activities.That seem to be rather different from allowing surveillance  on a &quot;whim&quot;.Until the details of this new &quot;framework&quot; are published one cannot judge how effective these measures are likely to be, they might be mere lip service. But let us look at the reason behind them. Since the  decision, EU entities have, in many cases, been restricted from sharing data with US entities, or storing data on US-located servers, because of a concern that current US law did not sufficiently protect the privacy of EU residents. These restrictions have been a problem for many US businesses.It seems that this new framework is aimed at giving enough privacy protection to lower these restrictions. It will be up to the EC and the European Courts to judge if the framework achieves that goal. If they decide that it does not, they can decline to lower, or reimpose, the data transfer restrictions, which would make the framework pointless for the US. It is in the US's interest to keep the EU authorities satisfied on this point.In the article  from the National Law Review it is states that:The success or failure of the new agreement will depend on the extent to which it overcomes the flaws identified by the ECJ in Schrems II. The ECJ ruled against the EU Commission's adequacy decision in favour of Privacy Shield, finding that data subjects were inadequately protected against electronic surveillance or signals intelligence activities carried out under US Federal authority, and that data subjects impacted by such activities had no viable route to redress....It is important to remember that Schrems II did not strike down Privacy Shield, which has continued to operate since July 2020. Rather, the European Court of Justice ruling struck down the EU Commission's adequacy decision in favour of Privacy Shield. Consequently, a key objective of the new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework is not to replace Privacy Shield, but to revive and enhance it with new mechanisms to address the flaws identified in Schrems II.Participating companies and organizations that take advantage of the Framework to legally protect data flows will continue to be required to adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles, including the requirement to self-certify their adherence to the Principles through the U.S. Department of Commerce.The language of the White House fact sheet suggests some areas likely to attract close scrutiny once the full details are available:What degree of impact on individual data subjects will be considered acceptable, and in what circumstances? The US government is not promising to refrain from the use of signals intelligence and electronic surveillance. It is promising only that intelligence activity will be limited to legitimate national security interests and that the impact on individuals will not be disproportionate.How far the composition of the proposed Data Protection Review Court will ensure that it is truly independent of the Federal government?According to :The deal includes a way for Europeans to object if they feel that their privacy has been violated, including through an independent Data Protection Review Court, the White House said in a fact sheet released after the news conference. The deal still needs to be made final, the United States and the European Commission said in a joint statement, adding that the White House would put its commitments in an executive order.Businesses that send European Union data to American servers have pushed hard for the governments to reach a new deal. Since the last pact was struck down more than 18 months ago, regulators in European countries have said companies cannot use certain web services, like Google Analytics and Mailchimp, because doing so could violate the privacy rights of Europeans.Meta, the parent company of Facebook, said this year that it might shut down its services in Europe if the governments didn't resolve their differences. Google's top lawyer had urged quick action to restore a practical framework that both protects privacy and promotes prosperity.The Friday announcement is the latest development in a lengthy debate about how far governments and tech companies should go to protect users' privacy. Europe's top court twice struck down pacts governing data flows between the United States and the European Union over concerns that the data would be exposed to American surveillance programs.All of this is based on the joint announcement by the US and the EC, with detailed documents apparently yet to come."}

For instance, the right for a criminal to be represented by counsel, granted by the 6th Amendment, did not originally apply to state level criminals. The process of  reversed this and made these rights apply to state level. But why wasn't it this way to begin with? What was the original rationale to have the Bill of Rights only apply to the federal level?","answer":" 2 U.S. 243 (1833) explains the rationale:  The Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the  United States for themselves, for their own government, and not for  the government of individual States. Each State established a  constitution for itself, and in that constitution provided such  limitations and restrictions on the powers of its particular  government as its judgment dictated.  The people of the United States framed such a government for the  United States as they supposed best adapted to their situation, and  best calculated to promote their interests. The powers they conferred  on this government were to be exercised by itself, and the limitations  on power, if expressed in general terms, are naturally and necessarily  applicable to the government created by the instrument. They are  limitations of power granted in the instrument itself, not of distinct  governments framed by different persons and for different purposes."}

One could take that as evidence that it is a hard problem to solve and it would be easier to move your data to the EU. The best summary I have come across is  which says:The CJEU reaffirmed the validity of SCCs but stated that companies must verify, on a case-by-case basis, whether the law in the recipient country ensures adequate protection, under EU law, for personal data transferred under SCCs and, where it doesn't, that companies must provide additional safeguards or suspend transfers. The ruling placed the same requirement on EU data protection authorities to suspend such transfers on a case-by-case basis where equivalent protection can not be ensured.This is where it gets tricky, particularly in the U.S. context.The CJEU itself assessed the sufficiency of protections with regard to U.S. government access to data and found them lacking. The question regulators and companies now face is whether the concerns raised by the court are applicable in the context of particular transfers and can be remedied through additional protections  again, not only in the U.S., but also in all countries without an adequacy determination.Privacy professionals may need to consider whether relevant surveillance programs and authorities apply in particular contexts. If they do, they could then assess whether those authorities include proportional limitations in the given context, as well as whether effective judicial remedies exist. Alternatively, they might consider ways to limit the context itself through additional safeguards. Encryption, for instance, might be a consideration."}
{"question":"If I used a copyrighted image in 4 item listings on a selling platform (all using the same image), would this constitute 1 infringement, 4 infringements, or a number of infringements equal to the number of items sold?","answer":"In criminal law we might talk in terms of a number of &quot;counts&quot; of an offence. E.g. &quot;the defendant is charged with 4 counts of copyright infringement&quot;.However you've asked about civil law copyright infringement, so that isn't relevant. If you are sued, the claimant is not seeking to convict you of X number of offences. Instead, they are probably seeking some combination of the following:A mandatory injunction to compel you to remove the copyrighted material.A prohibitory injunction to prevent you from using the material again.Damages to compensate them for your past use of the material.So, it is not useful to think about how many &quot;infringements&quot; there were as such. What matters is the extent and circumstances of the infringement insofar as it is relevant for determining how much damages should be awarded. For example, in  provides:The court may in an action for infringement of copyright having regardto all the circumstances, and in particular to(a) the flagrancy of the infringement, and(b) any benefit accruing to the defendant by reason of theinfringement,award such additional damages as the justice of the case may require.In the  provides:Member States shall ensure that the competent judicial authorities, onapplication of the injured party, order the infringer who knowingly,or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in an infringing activity,to pay the rightholder damages appropriate to the actual prejudicesuffered by him as a result of the infringement.When the judicial authorities set the damages:(a) they shall take into account all appropriate aspects, such as thenegative economic consequences, including lost profits, which theinjured party has suffered, any unfair profits made by the infringerand, in appropriate cases, elements other than economic factors, suchas the moral prejudice caused to the rightholder by the infringement;or(b) as an alternative to (a), they may, in appropriate cases, set thedamages as a lump sum on the basis of elements such as at least theamount of royalties or fees which would have been due if the infringerhad requested authorisation to use the intellectual property right inquestion."}

{"question":"The \"exclusionary Rule\" is a rule of criminal procedure in US courts that forbids admission of evidence obtained through violation of an accused person's fifth or sixth amendment rights, or through other unlawful action by the police or other governmental authorities.The rule has been somewhat controversial, with some saying tht it causes courts to ignore reliable evidence of crime, and allow people guilty of crime to go free.The rule has been justified as a method (some say the only workable method) of removing the incentive for the police to violate people's rights, and generally to disregard the law.What is the history of the rule in the US, the UK, and England? What is the current state of the rule in other jurisdictions? Where is it followed less strictly or not at all? An answer to  turned out to be inappropriate to the question, because of a misreading on my part. I am therefore creating this question and copying much opf that answer here before deleting it in place. The linked question currently contains the text:... there are non-US jurisdictions that allow defendants to be convicted on evidence that would be thrown out of a US court as unconstitutionally obtained, but the prosecution still has to present this evidence and use it to convince the court of the defendant's guilt.This leads to the question of what the scope of the rule is in these jurisdictions where some form of it applies.","answer":"History of the Exclusionary RuleThis rule, derived from the US .Prior to Weeks weaker and more limited versions of the rule had been imposed by  (limited to involuntary confessions).In the UK versions of the rule had been followed in at least some cases from 1769, (see Rudd's Case, 168 Eng. Rep. 160 (K.B. 1775)).Non-US JurisdictionsAlthough the rule was derived from English practice and the English common law, it was made much more absolute in the US by the US cases Weeks and Mapp, interpreting the US Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Many other jurisdictions have not observed the same kind of strict exclusion as the US has since Mapp.At one time or another, and in various cases, unlawfully obtained evidence has been accepted in court cases in England and Wales, Canada, Ireland, Germany, Israel, and Japan (but not in France or Scotland).  This is probably true in many other jurisdictions as well, but these are the ones mentioned in the sources quoted below.Scholarly SourcesIn  byPeter Ashford it is said that:The UK is consistent across criminal and civil courts generally favouring the admission of the disputed evidence, albeit with sanctionsand later thatFrench civil courts do not generally admit evidence obtained by illicit means. The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation does not admit illegally obtained evidence as the constitution provides at art 50 that in administering justice it shall not be allowed to use evidencereceived by violating the federal lawThe statutory provision which governs the exclusion of evidence in crime is the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) s 78. This permits the court to exclude evidence on which the prosecution intends to rely if it appears to the court, having regard to all the circumstances, that the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it....R. v P<br \/>This case involved intercepted calls by the police who tapped the phone of a suspected drug offender. The court held that the fair use of intercept evidence at a trial, even where such evidence was unlawfully gained, did not breach the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 art 6, but that the defendants did have a right to challenge the evidence.In  (1999) by  Yue Ma  (Policing Volume: 22 Issue: 3  Pages: 280-303) it is said that:In the United States the exclusionary rule was created by the judiciary with the intent of ensuring that police do not harm suspects and defendants by engaging in illegal tactics to obtain evidence against them. In England the exclusionary rule remains largely discretionary. Except in cases in which confessions are obtained illegally, the courts are not obligated to exclude evidence even in the face of police irregularity in evidence gathering. In using judicial discretion the courts balance the interest of the public and the interest of the accused. Commentators have noted that in the past decade or so there has been a trend in continental European countries -- including France, Germany, and Italy -- to tighten control over police and provide more safeguards for citizens. One measure taken to accomplish this goal is the expansive use of the exclusionary rule. Although European countries may boast of a longer history than the United States in suppressing illegally obtained evidence, the United States has the longest history of using the exclusionary rule as a means of deterring police illegality. England, France, Germany, and Italy are viewing such an exclusionary rule more favorably as police illegality appears to have a corrosive effect on justice procedures under regimes that do not have such a rule.In  by G. Arthur Martin (1961: Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, volume 52, issue 3) it is stated that:In Canada, the general rule is that evidence otherwise admissible is not rendered inadmissible by the fact that it was illegally obtained. This statement is, however, subject to the rules respecting the admissibility of confessions. Articles seized under an illegal search warrant or obtainedby a trespass are admissible,1 and evidence obtained by an illegal search of the person is also admissible.In Kuruma v. The Queen, Lord Goddard, speaking for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, said:In their Lordships' opinion the test to be applied in considering whether evidence is admissible is whether it is relevant to the matters in issue. If it is, it is admissible and the court is not concerned with how the evidence wasobtained.&quot; {R. v. Lee Hai, 64 Can. C.C. 49 (1935); R. v. Honan, 20 Can. C.C. 10 (1912); R. v. Doyle, 12 O.R. 347(1886).}...Under the prevailing English rule, the fact that evidence is obtained through a trespass or other illegal search or seizure does not exclude it from evidence. This rule was accepted during the nineteenth century in two cases of a somewhat low order of authority. In Derrington {2 C.&amp;P. 418, 172 E.R. 189 (1826).}, the prisoner gave a letter to the turnkey, who promised to post it, but who instead gave it to the prosecutor. Theletter was received in evidence. In Jones v. Owens{34 J.P. 759 (1870)}, a constable illegally searched the defendant and found twenty-five young salmon in his pocket; it was held that the evidence was admissible on a charge of illegal fishing. Mellor, J., said:I think it would be a dangerous obstacle to the administration of justice if we were to hold, because evidence was obtained by illegal means, it could notbe used against a party charged with an offence.&quot;...Other common law jurisdictions have almost invariably followed the traditional view and admitted evidence illegally obtained. ... Another example is Ceylon.Irish courts seem to have undergone a changeof attitude. In an 1887 case, evidence was admittedalthough illegally obtained, but in 1955 a judgerefused to admit evidence of fingerprints that hadbeen taken with the consent of the accused whenhe was in custody on a different charge, since hehad not been told of his right to refuse consent.{People v. Lawlor, [1955-6] Ir. Jur. Rep. 38, 21 J. Crim. L. (Eng.) 263 (1957).}...[In France] Proofs are admissible in the criminal trial only if they have been legally secured and legally adduced. If the French law accepts all modes of proofs, it emphasizes, nevertheless, the way to proceed to get the proof, with the result that any proof illegally obtained must be dismissed from the judiciary proceedings....In the German law of procedure, the &quot;rule offree evaluation of evidence&quot; as laid down in section261 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinaftercalled CCP) prevails. This provision reads: &quot;TheCourt shall evaluate the evidence according toits unlimited estimation and with due regard tothe general course of the trial.&quot; Section 261 isdosely related to Section 244(ii), CCP, whichreads: &quot;The Court shall ex officio expand thetaking of the evidence to all facts and evidencerelevant to the exploration of the truth.&quot; Suchevidence includes that which has been obtainedby the police.Hence the principle of free evaluation of evidencepermits the judge, and binds him at the same time,freely to weigh the evidence without any ties tostrict rules. ...To some extent, however, the judge's right to an unlimited evaluation of evidence is curtailed by the law. In certain cases it prohibits the judge, expressly or by nterpretation, from using certain evidence, especially evidence obtained in violation of legal commands or bans. But in the vastmajority of cases the use of such evidence is admissible in principle....The rule prevailing in Israel is the common lawrule that, for the purpose of deciding whethercertain evidence is or is not admissible, the courtwill not enquire into the methods by which thatevidence was obtained.{8 WIGMORE, EVIDENCE2183 (3d ed. 1940).} The only exception to the rule is that the court will enquire into the circumstances under which a confession was made, so as to ascertain whether it was made freely andvoluntarily.The sound principle underlying the rule is thatdirect evidence which is relevant to the issue andnot privileged from disclosure should be availableto the trier of fact; the sanction for any criminaloffence and the remedy for any civil wrong whichmay have been committed in obtaining that evidence are matters not for the law of evidence, but for the criminal law or the law of torts, as the case may be. Cases are known in which persons have been restrained by injunction from producing evidence wrongfully obtained{E.g., Ashburton v. Pape, [1913] 2 Ch. 469 (C.A.).}; such an injunctionis, of course, a remedy in tort, and implies noruling one way or the other on the evidential issue....It thus appears that where the common law as provided an exclusionary rule of evidence in the public interest and for reasons of public policy, the modern tendency is to divest that rule of general and unrestricted application, and to vest in the trial judge a discretion as to whether or not,and to what extent, to apply the rule in the particular case before him...Should illegally seized evidence be admissible year.to convict an accused? In Japan this question has been answered in the affirmative for many years. Back in 1899 the Supreme Court of Japan held, in a case under the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1890, that the defendant's pocket notebook, illegally seized by a policeman, was lawfullyreceived in evidence.{VoL 5, No. 1. Sup. Ct. Crim. Rep. 38 (1899).} In 1949 the Supreme Court held, in a case under the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1922, that it was lawful for the trial court to convict the accused by receiving a piece of physical evidence which had been seized withillegal procedure. {Decision of the Supreme Court (3rd Petty Bench, D.ec. 31, 1949) (unpublished).} ...Under the new Code of Criminal Procedure of1948 there have been no Supreme Court decisionsprecisely on point, but there are some high courtdecisions which follow the traditional rule."}

See, e.g., Int'l House of Pancakes, Inc. v. Albarghouthi, No. 04-cv02264-MSK-MEH, 2007 WL 2669117 (D. Colo. Sept. 6, 2007); Elkhatib v. Dunkin' Donuts, Inc., 493 F.3d 827 (7th Cir. 2007); Harper v.

Feb. 1, 2000) (motion for summary judgment); Smith v. Molly Maid, Inc., 415 F. Supp. 2d 905 (N.D. Ill. 2006).Employment law protections rarely apply to franchise relationships. See Adcock v. Chrysler Corp., 166 F.3d 1290, 1294 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that because Chrysler did not control day-to-day operations of dealership, dealer would not be considered employee for sex discrimination claim); Mangram v. Gen. Motors Corp., 108 F.3d 61, 63 (4th Cir. 1997) (holding that General Motors dealers are not employees of General Motors and that plaintiff, at best, demonstrated that as a participant in General Motors' Minority Dealership Development Program he was a trainee for a nonemployment relationship with General Motors for purposes of age discrimination claim).This question was a result of a recent conversation regarding ChickFilet only selling their franchises to Christians. I thought that wasdiscriminatory, but was told a private company can do anything theywant because they are privately owned. I find this very hard tobelieve is the case in 2021. Can anyone shed some light on thissubject?Not all kinds of discrimination are prohibited by Section 1981 (which was enacted shortly after the adoption of the 14th Amendment in the post-U.S. Civil War context and is the only or primary federal non-discrimination law applicable to franchise contracts), although state law protections are often broader. See Saint Francis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 613 (1987)(holding that 1981 does not address discrimination claims based on national origin); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 167 (1976) (noting that 1981 does not cover discrimination based on gender or religion); Kodish v. United Air Lines, Inc., 628 F.2d 1301, 1303 (10th Cir. 1980) (finding age discrimination claim not addressed by 1981).In particular, discrimination on the basis of religion in franchising contracts is not prohibited by federal law, although it is prohibited by state law in some states.But a franchisee in operating the franchise business must follow all state and federal non-discrimination laws that apply to public accommodations with respect to their customers, and must follow all state and federal non-discrimination laws that apply to employees with respect to their employees."}
{"question":"My employer likes to randomly change my schedule and only passively notify me on a secured website that im supposed to check 10x a day. Is this legal? Then of course i get a write up for missing a shift that randomly appeared while i was sleeping.Is this legal? Where can i find legal documents in regards to this? ","answer":"As a general rule, employees are employees at will in Colorado, unless otherwise provided, which means that you can be fired at any time, with or without cause, for any reason other than those prohibited by law (e.g. race, gender, religion, whistleblowing in some cases) including a few reasons particular to Colorado law rather than federal law, such as sexual orientation, legal off-duty conduct in certain circumstances and voting. (The main exceptions are employees with written employment contracts usually in senior management, unionized employees and civil servants, which sometimes also limit schedule changes.)If you are fired for cause, or quit, you are not entitled to unemployment benefits. But, if you are fired without cause, or you are 'constructively discharged' then you are entitled to unemployment benefits. A 'constructive discharge' colloquially speaking, means that conditions were made so bad for you that you were forced to quit.There are also no rules limiting changes in schedules, assuming that each schedule allocates you the break time mandated by the Fair Labor Standards Act, and that you get paid overtime is you work sufficient hours to qualify for it under the Fair Labor Standards Act.It is conceivable that frequent changes in schedules could cause a 'constructive discharge' although I've never encountered a case (personally or in reported case law) where that has happened because it is quite unusual behavior for an employer.Ultimately, the logic of employment at will is that if your employer is not good to work for, that you should seek employment with another employer who is more tolerable. Similarly, an employer constantly behaving in an unreasonable way may have trouble holding onto employees."}
{"question":"Let's say a 16 year old girl manages to speak to her doctor in private during a regular appointment and requests birth control.  She is afraid her parents would respond poorly to knowing she is considering sexual intercourse, and so requests the doctor make up some other excuse for prescribing the medicine, such as to regulate or manage her periods.I assume the doctor has the right to decline to make up an excuse for the prescription, and in absence of doctor being willing to justify it a minor may not request the prescription since their parents may guess on the reason for it.Aside from that though I'm more wondering can the doctor inform her parents of her request, and that she is considering sexual activity?  Legally does she have a legal right to demand her request be kept private from her legal guardians?Assume the minor is living with her parents and hasn't been emancipated.","answer":"A 16 year old is not considered, for these purposes, a minor so she can legally engage in consentual sexual activity (with certain exemptions not relevant here).A child under 16 can get professional advice from a medical practitioner about birth control without their parents' knowledge or consent - and have it prescribed - as long as they satisfy the :He\/she has sufficient maturity and intelligence to understand the nature and implications of the proposed treatmentHe\/she cannot be persuaded to tell her parents or to allow the doctor to tell themHe\/she is very likely to begin or continue having sexual intercourse with or without contraceptive treatmentHis\/her physical or mental health is likely to suffer unless he\/she received the advice or treatmentThe advice or treatment is in the young person's best interests. \/><sup>1<\/sup>These guidelines stem from the House of Lords judgement in  which was primarily concerned with determining a child's capacity to consent to medical treatment."}

Say if it just says the company and 1920 with no copyright symbol or notice, does this qualify as a notice of copyright in the United States?","answer":"For United States works from that time, a copyright notice required the copyright symbol (?or something very close to that), the original copyright holder's name, and the year of first publication."}
{"question":"Let's say a company registered in Delaware manufactures its products in Texas and sells them around the country online, and in person in New York. What taxes, and from which state(s), apply when products are manufactured in State A, sold in State B, and the company doing the making and selling is registered in State C?","answer":"Typically it works like this:Sales Tax:Owed in the state that the sale is made (in your case, New York). This is difficult in the internet age with businesses operated with no physical presence in a state. Technically sales (and local taxes) are due depending on where the item that was sold is delivered, so if you shipped an item made in Texas to New York, New York sales taxes would be due on that item. These taxes would be paid to the state of New York. Same for all 50 states. This is a huge burden on small businesses and is not usually enforced. Most small businesses only collect sales tax on items sold to the state that the business is operating from (in your example, you would only collect Texas state sales tax).Income Tax:This is the corporate tax levied by the state that the business is operating in, in this case it would be Texas. Since Texas does not have a state income tax, there would be no income tax. However Texas does have a Franchise Tax that would be due (this is due from all business organized or operating in Texas)The state that the business is registered in may have its own taxes which would be on the income of the business and would be specific to the state that the business is registered in.

I thought that this case must be treated within the frame of the law of the state (in this case Wisconsin). As far as I know B. Obama refused to grant a pardon from this reason. So why is the federal judge involeved in this case right now?","answer":"The Steven Avery case is explained in detail . Federal courts can collaterally review state court convictions in a habeas corpus action to determine if the conviction was obtained through a violation of a person's federal constitutional rights that the state courts refused to remedy after the person aggrieved attempted to obtain a remedy in the state court system.In his case, the federal court found in a habeas corpus action brought by Mr. Avery that his conviction was obtained in violation of his rights under the United States Constitution because his confession was coerced, even though the state court system had refused to reverse his conviction on this ground.The President of the United States cannot pardon a state court conviction even though a federal court can review the validity of a state court conviction in a habeas corpus proceeding.Federal courts also have jurisdiction over lawsuits for money damages brought for violations of someone's rights under the United States Constitution committed by a local government or brought against a government employee, as opposed to against a state government per se, and Mr. Avery also pursued a violation of civil rights action in federal court earlier on in the saga of his case.

{"question":"The water level behind Oroville Dam, CA, recently went way up due to heavy rain, and the rarely used 'emergency spillway' was used for the first time in the dam's 50+ year life.  It sustained significant damage and authorities tweeted out, Auxiliary spillway at Oroville Dam predicted to fail within the next hour. Oroville residents evacuate northward.  Officials' fear of a catastrophic flood prompted the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people.   concluded with a note that 'Inmates at the Butte County Jail also had been moved to Alameda County, about 170 miles away.'  As of this writing, no such flood occurred, but for the sake of this question suppose one had, before the inmates were evacuated.  Suppose that the guards saw (or were taken out by) some imminent danger and are out of the picture, though the inmates don't necessarily know why - they just notice water coming in and rising inside, relatively quickly.  They don't know how high it will go; maybe nobody does.  What rights do they have?If they try to escape, is that a crime (e.g. attempted\/actual Escape) they'll be prosecuted for later?  If they succeeded, but were traumatized by it being an extremely dangerous situation and no longer trust the state to take care of them and provide the protection from those kinds of dangers that they thought was part of their duty, are they still practically required to go back into that situation, with the State getting a free pass?  If they get out, for how long can they remain free (and if the jail is severely damaged, to where would they be required to go?) At 20:14 in , an inmate who was first released due to prison overcrowding is described as having been 'lost' during Hurricane Katrina, and the attorney general's office has no idea where that person is, end of story (?).   There may be other, more direct answers based on actual situations of what happened after Katrina, or in some fires, etc.; it seems likely this sort of thing has actually happened when jailers faced a disaster without having or using sufficient advance notice.The question is focused on California, but answers\/examples from other jurisdictions might be interesting too.","answer":"It is a felony to escape from a jail; see ).However, California law recognizes a  when a crime is committed in order to avoid 'significant bodily harm'.  (See the link for other important elements of the defense.)  This defense would probably only be viable if after escaping, the inmate turned himself in as promptly as he reasonably could, once clear of the immediate danger of harm.  He could go to any police station or law enforcement office; or he could call any police agency, explain the situation, and wait for them to come and arrest him.  He would then presumably be taken to a different jail.If the inmate thinks the jail is unsafe, he can sue the state in either state or federal court (the latter as a civil rights case).  It's unlikely that a court would order his release on this basis; more likely, they would order the state to improve conditions in some specific way, and they might award monetary damages to the inmate if he is injured.  He also would probably not be able to stay out of jail during the suit.  If the state arrests him, they'll put him in jail unless a court orders his release (or he's granted bail, or his case is otherwise resolved).  If he hides to avoid arrest, then he's a fugitive.  I seem to recall there's a general principle that fugitives don't have access to the courts."}

{"question":"The employment contract that I signed specified that I work a maximum of 20 hours a week. For the past two years I've been scheduled more that, around 24-40 hours a week. Does this entitle me to additional compensation, such as overtime?","answer":"  I've been scheduled more that, around 24-40 hours a week. Does this entitle me to additional compensation, such as overtime?Yes.  of the California Labor Code provides that:  Notwithstanding any agreement to work for a lesser wage, any employee  receiving less than the legal minimum wage or the legal overtime  compensation applicable to the employee is entitled to recover in a  civil action the unpaid balance of the full amount of this minimum  wage or overtime compensation, including interest thereon, reasonable  attorney's fees, and costs of suit.The contractual maximum of 20 weekly hours is stricken\/superseded every time (1) your employer schedules you in excess of 20 hours in a week and (2) you accept it. Thus, you could pursue the recovery of unpaid wages under two legal theories. One of them is the aforementioned statute, since your implied contract --pertaining to the excess of 20 weekly hours-- constitutes an agreement to work for a lesser wage than the legal minimum wage.The other theory or claim under which you may proceed is breach of contract. Again, this refers to the implied agreements regarding any unpaid wages in excess of 20 weekly hours. Under this theory you would recover just the full wages (rather than only the minimum wage), whereas the statutory provision entitles you to reasonable attorney's fees.You might want to get some acquaintance with the , since it describes how to proceed and might also touch on other issues which might be applicable to your situation (and not mentioned in your post).If your matter is filed in court, there is always a chance that your case might be presided by some  that 'The state loves insurance companies and it employers [...] and you have to [...] stay out of the way'. But contract law and section 1194 of the Labor Code encompass what the law is in regard to your matter.Edited to add (per A.fm.'s )In case you are being paid for all the hours you work and your concern is only whether\/when should your hourly wage be higher than the regular rate, the answer depends on whether your schedule meets any of the conditions listed in :any work in excess of eight hours in one workday;any work in excess of 40 hours in any one workweek (you mention having worked around 24-40, which suggests but is not conclusive that the threshold of 40 hours is not exceeded);the first eight hours worked on the seventh day of work in any one workweek;any work in excess of 12 hours in one day (entitling to twice the regular rate of pay);any work in excess of eight hours on any seventh day of a workweek (entitling to twice the regular rate of pay)."}
{"question":"In general, people can write any contract they want. In practice, many people agree to a contract without even reading. Even those that read carefully may miss important terms if the writers of the contract obfuscate the terms deliberately. Some scammy sellers often obfuscate some part of the contracts to make really bad deals look good.Some samples: Here a seller in Sim Lim writes $1000 fee as $36 x 24. Many buyers end up paying $2k for an iPhone that usually worth $1kIn United States, people sell Acai Berry.  Basically, people sign up for a cheap free trial not realizing that they end up subscribing to hundreds of dollars cost of products that are not workingIn Indonesia, mixing insurance and investment can be very dangerous. That's because the fee can be 100 times bigger than normal. The fee is obfuscated even more than the Sim Lim scam. No normal person can know such fee without being told. The companies have agents that supposedly \"explain\" the fee. However, it seems that most agents do not tell about the fees and instead lie or mislead customers by claiming that all money are invested. If we follow strict standard contract policy, the customer is at fault for not reading the contract carefully.However, I noticed that in US and Singapore such scammy contracts are punished. FTC screw acai berry scams. Sim Lim scammers are jailed.Yet in Indonesia, large corporations keep selling their ridiculously overpriced products counting on customers not knowing about their hidden fees.So how come Indonesia is different? Are scamming by obfuscating contracts common too in US and Singapore?What are the difference in the laws, between Indonesia, Singapore, and US, that may explain why such scams happen in Indonesia and done by large companies?Some of the thing that may be the case areIn Indonesia, truth is not a defense against defamation. Also defamation can be a criminal case instead of just civil.Prosecuting anyone for fraud is extremely difficult in IndonesiaMaybe there isn't really any differences. Similar scams exist in other countries too.I've heard in US there are rules that 80% of money must be used for reimbursement. Is this true?So what are the differences?","answer":"According to thisIt is flat out against the law to mislead or deceive - you can't lie,you can't conceal salient facts, you can't tell half truths, you can'teven tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth if thatcould be misleading.So it seems that there is a big different in laws between Australia and Indonesia.

{"question":"I was speaking with my friend, who sounded real nervous, saying she thinks her roommate might be stealing from work.  It's been going on for a few weeks and she can't tell for sure, because her roommate is apparently sort of a mysterious person and my friend goes to school all day and barely sees this roommate anyways so is not really sure, but feels like there are enough hints of things she seen the roommate carry in and that it might be the case.  That maybe her roommate is selling stuff she stole from work, she doesn't know.  My friend has been afraid of asking the roommate directly if she's stealing.Long story short, given that my friend is on anxiety medication and I felt real bad for her cause she sounded real anxious, I said just protect yourself, it's nothing to do with you, and don't think about it, and she said what if it IS true and cops come and go through her stuff and turn her room upside down and interrogate her (she has a trauma of when her dad went to prison when she was younger, and she and her family used to live in Russia).  I said it's not gonna happen, unless she has anything of the roommate in her room and she said none.  But after the call now I'm starting to wonder because I don't know the laws and have never dealt with cops myself, don't know their process.  She lives in Seattle btw.  So can anybody tell me what the procedure would be, like if someone is suspected of theft, like can they just break into a place and turn the whole apartment upside down, interrogate everyone, etc, if several people live there, or is it just the one person they suspect?","answer":"What police can do in practice and what they can do in theory vary. They generally try to follow the theory because that makes arrests stick. But they can be reasonable or unreasonable, and it really depends on the situation and the officer. Most allegations of stealing at work are also dealt with by an employer through firing and frequently do not involve calling law enforcement--a decision the workplace should make with assistance of counsel.A search incident to a lawful arrest is a valid exception to the warrant requirement. If police arrest a person they are (federally, at least) allowed to search the area for anything that might be a danger to them, like someone hiding in the next room with a shotgun. There are a lot of can-go-wrong scenarios that will be a nightmare for a person with anxiety, but mostly the police are focused on the thing they are called about. They are not there to go looking for trouble--they have a hard job and are trying to be responsible about it. But their procedures can sometimes be very difficult to live through or can result in harm to innocents or an intrusion on the privacy of innocents because they are so used to dealing with guilty people.As a practical matter, your friend should do what she can to get out of the situation with the roommate she doesn't trust. If he steals at work, would he steal from her, and how can she trust him to pay his part of the rent? If her friend is arrested, who is paying his rent? When he gets out on bail, is she still comfortable living with him? It sounds like she would be best looking for new roommates.If she anticipates police interaction over anything she has done or anything someone else might think she has done, she should contact an experienced criminal defense lawyer. She may also need to seek mental help for her condition, although she should ask the lawyer about privilege in that situation. And you need to read up more about helping people with anxiety, because it can consume your life if you let it.Disclaimer: this is a general analysis and you should consult an experienced attorney and probably after that a psychologist to determine the most helpful course of action, because the situation may require a different response more apparent to a person with more experience or facts. Experts have experience. Use it."}

{"question":"Suppose Party B signs a one year contract with a binding arbitration agreement to rent commercial space from Party A. As part of the agreement, Party B agrees to pay $2,000 a month rent to Party A (the landlord) and $1 a month for each square foot it occupies to Party C (another company who occupies space in the same building) for its share of utilities.At this point, Party C has no connection to Party A. They just happen to rent space from Party A in the same building and voluntarily took on the responsibility of paying the utility bill.

Party C continues accept money for utilities from Party B.After several years, Party C acquires ownership of the entire building and Party B wishes to dispute the amount paid for utilities during the first year - either because it turns out that it paid more than $1 per square foot or because it miscalculated the number of square feet it was occupying and should have paid less.Is the dispute subject to arbitration?One one hand, Party C did not own the building when it accepted the utility payments from Party B and at that point it did not inherit any of the obligations of the prior owner. On the other hand, now that it acquired the building and inherited the obligations of the prior owner, perhaps as the recipient of the extra utility payment, the arbitration agreement gains retroactive force?","answer":"It's not a question of retroactivelyWhen Party C became the principal of the contract, they assumed all the rights and obligations of Party A - including the right\/obligation to arbitrate disputes."}

{"question":"Because of space limitations, I need a concise way to saylaws and regulationsWould 'statutes' work?(If you need more context, I am citing both IDEA and New York State Commissioner Regulations Part 200.)","answer":"It's not clear why you have such a need, but I understand the underlying terminological issue. Legislative bodies pass laws, that is, there are bills approved by the legislative body. You can abstract out of the language of a bill certain text that is 'the statute', and usually you can determine what that stuff is by looking at the consolidated 'code' \u2013 though not in New York. Some of that which is enacted by a legislative body is language allowing administrative authorities to construct 'regulations' (broadly construed). At the federal level, there is a quirky usage difference between 'rule' and 'regulation' having to do with whether the thing is about how the agency operates, vs. what people (e.g. businesses) must not do. Usually, we just call them all 'regulations', though the agencies will talk about 'the final rule' \u2013 basically the same thing. There is a third thing that pertains to 'law', and that is legal precedent \u2013 principles established by appeals courts.All of that stuff is 'law'. If you need to distinguish types, you can refer to 'statutory law', 'case law' or 'regulations' (perhaps 'regulatory law' but that might confuse the reader). However, there is a popular understanding that only statutory law is 'law'. So whether you effectively communicate with just the word 'law' depends on the level of legal and political sophistication of your audience."}

And that scenario seems inconsistent with having enough technology to download and use the font at issue.tracking down the copyright holder would entail enormous costs (having to contact hundreds of people), so that that one's family doesn't get enough food on the tableThe fact that required fee is explicitly, and only, USD 5 relieves the user of the burden of ensuring that the author's entire family gets &quot;enough food on the table&quot;. The author is just friendly about [needlessly] justifying the fee he requires. But that friendliness ought not to be construed as a loophole, since the contractual intent is very explicit: A fee of 5 USD in exchange for continued use of the font.Nor is the author's disappearance (?) a valid argument for eluding payment. The author provided a commonplace method (PayPal) for registering the usage of the font.Even if by disappearance you mean that the author is dead, the copyright holder (or beneficiary) would prevail.

{"question":"The text of the 2nd Amendment of the US Constitution reads:A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.This is somewhat narrowly worded in the sense that it does not say anything about a right to manufacture, buy, sell, gift, or otherwise traffic arms. However, since the enumerated right to 'keep and bear' (whatever that means) is not intended as a dead letter, some amount of legal gun manufacturing and transfer would seem to be a background assumption.Does the current legal interpretation of the 2nd Amendment understand it as protecting arms manufacturing and trafficking? Where in the case law is such reasoning developed?","answer":"  423 F.

{"question":"I recently paid for a major airline ticket, and it got processed saying that the payment worked (on the website, and printed out the PDF). A moment later they canceled my order. Is this a bait and switch, or illegal false advertising for not confirming that it was available at that price (i.e. they changed the price after I clicked submit, and it said \"confirmed\")?","answer":"It is not a bait and switch, nor false advertising. It might be a violation of contract, depending on the exact wording of the TOS or other agreement with the site. Probably not.&quot;Bait and switch&quot; refers to the tactic of advertising a specific product at a good price to draw one into a store (or to a site) and then claiming to be out of the advertised item, and attempting to sell the buyer a different item, usually one that is not as good a bargain. Even then, this is only illegal in most places if the seller did not have enough stock to meet reasonably anticipated demand. A notice such as &quot;quantities limited&quot; or &quot;while supplies last&quot; generally makes this legal. If no attempt is made to &quot;switch&quot; the customer to a different product, there is also usually no illegality.Whether this is false advertising depends on exactly how it was advertised. If the TOS or ads contained wording such as &quot;no purchase is final until confirmed with airline&quot; then there is probably no false advertising, but the exact definition depends on the specifics of local law, and the details of the facts will matter a good bit."}
{"question":"In my understanding the reasons why one has to pay alimony to the other are something like during the marriage one had a job and the other one stayed at home to care for children and housekeeping and such, so after the divorce the latter ends up without an income which is not fair.This probably explains why (and IMO justifies that) it's much more often the man who is sentenced to pay the woman than the other way around.But if this is actually the reason, then the ratio of divorced men paying the ex wife versus divorced women paying the ex husband should more or less reflect the ratio of employed men to employed women.  E.g., if every 100 persons having a job 70 are men and 30 are women, I would expect that every 100 divorces where one is sentenced to pay alimony to the other there were approximately 30 where the woman has to pay the man, while I really think the actual number is enormously smaller in reality (and if someone can cite some reliable numbers about this ratio it would be great).So what are the legal criteria to decide who pays alimony to whom?ADDED: Let's focus on USA but answers \/ comments related to other jurisdictions would still be of interest.ADDED: I found  that appears to mention official, reliable numbers.","answer":"  the ratio of divorced men paying the ex wife versus divorced women  paying the ex husband should more or less reflect the ratio of  employed men vs. employed womenNot necessarily.

Extraditions to Category 1 countries, which include Sweden, are solely dealt with by the judiciary.The government cannot decide order or precedence between simultaneous valid extradition orders to both Category 1 and Category 2 countries as they have no ability in law to interfere in a Category 1 extradition, so it will probably come down to a race between which extradition proceeding completes first, or a determination made by the judiciary as to which one must be effected first."}

{"question":"What is the typical consequences if a foreign person stop paying landlord rent for housing and leave USA?This question is for a friend.","answer":"The law only addresses possible legal consequences, from which you could surmise what actually happens. If a person stops paying rent, the landlord institutes eviction proceedings, and may sue for the remainder of the rent for the term of the lease: they have an obligation to try to find a replacement tenant, to mitigate the damage. Some relief is available to the landlord in the deposit, from which the unpaid rent might be deducted, but let's assume that after that, the actual damage suffered is $5,000.When you sue a person in your home state, the court serves official notice that the defendant must appear to answer the charges, and the state has jurisdiction over the respondent because they are in that state. Giving notice and collecting on a judgment across jurisdictions can get complicated and expensive, so it would depend on what kind of treaties exist between the countries. There is the  which may simplify the business of giving notice to parties, which works if the respondent fled to Norway or India but not if they fled to Somalia or Turkmenistan. Since it turns out the US is not party to any multinational treaty recognizing foreign judgments, that country is not obligated to care about a US judgment, so unless the person left assets in the US, you may not be able to collect.You could sue in the person's country (hire a local attorney to pursue the matter). The main legal question would be whether there is any conflict between the lease and local law: while the basic idea of a lease is universally recognized, there may be peculiar conditions or procedures applicable in that country. (Norway has some laws pertaining to 'shared utilities' which don't exist in the US, which might put a US lease at odds with Norwegian law, and there are rent-raising rules that don't exist here). It might be necessary that you appear in court in that country to swear under oath that the lease was agreed to voluntarily, or the court may require a special form of 'notarization' not available in the US. None of that renders international litigation impossible, though a favorable judgment might be unlikely in some courts. The cost of litigation might be much higher than what would be awarded by a court."}

I would like more time to prepare for a family court case in which I intend on representing myself. Can you recommend any links\/articles\/cases\/books?Is a 'hearing' and a 'case' the same thing? Does case refer to the docket number of a hearing?","answer":"A 'hearing' is a time for the court to interact with the parties in a case before it on a specific date and time for a specific purpose. Some hearings are procedural and some hearings involve the taking of evidence. Unless specifically indicated to the contrary, hearings must be attended in person.A 'case' consists of all of the filings and proceedings assigned the same case number by the court and generally flowing from the same petition or other initial request for relief.For example, a suit to collect child support is a 'case', in which there might be several hearings and many legal documents filed, all flowing from a single initiating document.The best procedure in a civil case would be to call the other side's lawyer, determine if they object to a continuance of the hearing, and if not, to contact the clerk of the court making the request and follow up with a written filing with a case caption with the court, with a copy mailed to all other parties in the case, requesting the extension of time. The Court may grant or deny it in its discretion, but if you can truthfully state that the other side does not object to the extension, it is very likely to be granted.Family court in New York State has both civil and criminal jurisdiction. In criminal cases (e.g. domestic violence) the process may be somewhat different.

The US Supreme court held that this violated the man's rights under the First Amendment's establishment clause, which had been incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth. The man was not, as far as I can tell, himself a Secular Humanist, and Secular Humanism was mentioned in the footnote merely as an example of a belief system that did not include a belief in God. Why Justice Black used the term 'religion' to refer to it, I cannot say, some of the other groups listed in the footnote are clearly religions, and others are belief systems that for First Amendment purposes are often treated similarly to religions. What might better describe the Court's rulings here than the linked site does is that believers in Secular Humanism, Ethical Culture, and other similar belief systems will have their beliefs protected in just the same way that believers in any religion will. Freedom of Religion includes the right not to have a religion.By the way, the passage from Everson v. Board of Education, 330 US 1 which is quoted in Torcaso v. Watkins and to which the linked web site probably refers is:  The 'establishment of religion' clause of the First Amendment means at least this: neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or nonattendance. No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups, and vice versa. In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect 'a wall of separation between church and State.'By the way, any site which proclaims that  was a 'Marxist agent' has lost much credibility in my opinion. Read the linked article and other easily available sources and judge for yourself."}
{"question":"As a hypothetical question: A driver crashes his or her car and anticipates that the police will eventually come and conduct a field sobriety test. The driver then, after the crash has occurred and before the police have arrived, goes to a bar and consumes alcohol. The police eventually do arrive at the scene and do conduct a field sobriety test and find the driver to be under the influence.Will the police be able to use the results of this test to persecute the driver even if they cannot prove that the driver was under the influence when he or she was driving (since the driver can prove that he or she got intoxicated after the crash had occurred)?Just a legal shower thought I had, curious as to something like this would be resolved.","answer":"YesA blood alcohol reading taken by a calibrated breathalyser within 2 hours is, by law, the reading at the time of the offence. If the accused elects to have a blood test, there is a specified formula for working back back to the reading at the time of the offence.Consuming alcohol between the offence and the test will almost certainly make things worse for the offender.This law was brought in in response to a case where precisely what you shower thought led to an acquittal."}
{"question":"If I'm a police officer in the United States and my partner is restraining a suspect with an excessive or otherwise out-of-protocol use of force, what am I legally allowed to do to stop him?","answer":"As mentioned in a comment by @Dancrumb, the exact policies of each local police department will be different, and there are thousands of them. There is a relevant requirement at the Federal level , but it is not clear to me to what extent this applies to peers and not just supervisors:  An officer who purposefully allows a fellow officer to violate a victim's Constitutional rights may be prosecuted for failure to intervene to stop the Constitutional violation. To prosecute such an officer, the government must show that the defendant officer was aware of the Constitutional violation, had an opportunity to intervene, and chose not to do so. This charge is often appropriate for supervisory officers who observe uses of excessive force without stopping them, or who actively encourage uses of excessive force but do not directly participate in them."}
{"question":"I was involved in an accident, but I didn't know it happened. Another driver merged into the lane I was in aggressively and made contact with my car, but between me honking, yelling(as most probably would in this situation), focusing on turning to avoid, and music I did not hear or feel any contact being made.Shortly after, at the stoplight. The Driver got out of his car and took a picture of my plate. Did not attempt to wave me down or get my attention to pull over. I saw this as a threatening road rage move(why would someone take a picture of my plate and not notify me?)Then as we continued travel, he followed me and flashed his beams at me, again I only saw this as threatening\/taunting. In no way did I get the sense of there being 'trouble' in the sense of an accident.Somehow he was able to flag a travelling officer and pulled me over to the side. At this point I still did not know any contact was made and was pulling me over for speeding or something minor like that, but I was thankful for that because I would tell the officer about the threatening other driver.It wasn't until the officer told me (first thing, before I could say what I wanted to), that there was an accident and I ran. I got out of my car and to my surprise there was minor scratches on my quarter panel. So I received a citation for hit and run, but the other driver was at fault. (this was explained to me to be the case)So, in short, I received a hit and run without any knowledge of there being a hit. I have not received a court date yet(this all happened yesterday morning), but I am very anxious and frankly, scared. What can I do now?extra info: I am in the state of Florida and both vehicles are insured.","answer":"Well, first, you report the accident to your insurance. Be factual.  Your respective insurance companies will argue over liability compensation. As for the ticket, I am not familiar with Florida law, but I assume this is still a traffic offense and not a criminal charge. You would want to contest this ticket. You may want a lawyer, but you would plead not guilty. (BTW, you should check your ticket to see if you have to request a court date yourself.)Based on your account, the officer cannot testify as a witness to the original incident and his interpretation of events would be hearsay (assuming the officer even shows up in the first place). So if the other party doesn't show up to testify, your ticket gets dismissed. Otherwise, the judge will decide whether you were guilty or not. Again, I'm not familiar with Florida courts and I'm assuming this is just a traffic citation, so I don't know if probation or a remedial driving class is a possible alternative to avoiding points for a guilty verdict."}
{"question":"Let's say that I sign a NDA with a company to work with them.While working, I think about using a search engine to search more information about some tools they use (to learn more about them for example, or to see if any information has leaked online).Since search engines are sometimes known for collecting data people type in them, could the simple fact of entering certain words or sentences in a search engine create a NDA breach?This scenario would happen in the USA.","answer":"IANAL, but probably not - you are not sharing sensitive information with a third party, rather you are gathering it yourself.To some extent it would depend on the search term, and how you got to it, and possibly the wording of your NDA.NDA's typically prevent you from disclosing sensitive information, or information not already in the public domain - I would argue the information you are searching for is already in the public domain (if it returns a result), or meaningless to a search engine, and thus not a breach if you don't."}

They can't issue pardons for crimes not yet committed.The scope of pardons issued by the Governor is limited; this power is subject to regulation by law issued by the Legislature, and (if there is no regulation giving sole power of pardon to the president) the Legislature may form a council to review pardons. The council's advice and consent must be sought.  In fact, the Legislature appoints the Parole Board to this role. So the Parole Board gives advice and consent to pardons issued by the Governor.In practice, therefore, the Parole Board makes these decisions, as Governors rarely refuse pardons recommended by the Board. Generally, though, pardons are rare, Mike Pence granted only three during his tenure as Governor.References:"}

In addition, some money counting machines will scan the serial numbers of money that is counted, and cash used for a ransom, for example, may have its serial numbers tracked.

{"question":"In the context of an in-person conversation in the State of Washington (a two-party state), an  states:Whether a conversation or other communications is 'private' depends on  a number of case-specific factors, such as the subjective intention of  the parties, the reasonableness of their expectation that the  conversation would be private, the location of the conversation, and  whether third parties were present.Suppose the location was your desk at work, and a co-worker came up and propositioned you. Further suppose that though this is in the midst of a cubicle farm nobody else was in earshot.Would it be legal to record such a conversation at your workplace without getting the consent of the co-worker?I can't tell from this as it seems to me: a) The subjective intention of the co-worker would probably be that the conversation was private; b) the lack of other people within earshot might have provided the co-worker with the expectation the conversation would be private; but on the other hand, c) at that location you would not expect privacy.(I will accept as valid, BTW, an answer pointing me to reasonably authoritative documentation, up to and including court cases on point.  I was unable to find it: Stuff I found was all in the context of telephone conversations (i.e. not in-person) or public hearings or being a journalist.)","answer":"A reasonably analogous case is , and concludes that 'A communication is private (1) when parties manifest a subjective intention that it be private and (2) where that expectation is reasonable' (with appropriate in-state citations). They say that  Factors bearing on the reasonableness of the privacy expectation  include the duration and subject matter of the communication, the  location of the communication and the presence or potential presence  of third parties, and the role of the nonconsenting party and his or  her relationship to the consenting party. Ultimately, the intent or  reasonable expectations of the participants as manifested by the facts  and circumstances of each case controls as to whether a conversation  is privatebut in this case,  Kipp manifested a subjective intention that the conversation be  private. We have found subjective intent that a conversation be  private even though the party does not explicitly state such an  intentionThe court in fact rejects the state's contention that  a person who confesses to child molestation should expect this  information to be reported to the authorities, and therefore it is  unreasonable to expect the conversation to remain privateand the court reaffirms that  the subject matter of the conversation in this case was not one that  is normally intended to be public, demonstrating Kipp's reasonable  expectation of privacy."}
{"question":"I've recently come across a newspaper illustration from the mid-1920s which I'd like to reprint. Here in the US, the term of copyright for written material is the life of the author + 70 years. What is the law with regards to reprinting newspaper illustrations (where the rights were likely sold) and what are the laws for copyright on artwork ?The work is an illustration of the London Beis Din by Bryan de Grineau (1882-1957) discussed .","answer":"It depends.First of all, unpublished works from the 1920s, even before 1923, would not yet be in the public domain.  (You probably wouldn't be calling it a 'newspaper illustration' if it wasn't published in a newspaper, but this rule still matters for one special case I'll get to later.)If the work was originally published in the US, or was published in the US within 30 days of its original publication, then something published in the 1920s could be public domain in the US if one of the following is true:The work was published before 1923.  (In the US, the date of death of the author does not matter for works published before 1978.)The work was published without a copyright notice. The copyright was not renewed.If the work was originally published outside the US, other rules may apply:  If the work was published before 1923, it would be in the public domain under US law.  However, if it was published in a language other than English, then in some states it was treated as unpublished until it was published in compliance with US laws.If the work was created by a resident of a country such as Iran that is not a party to copyright agreements, the work is unprotected by US copyright law.For most other countries and circumstances, it depends on whether it was in the public domain in its home country in 1996 (or some later date, if the country didn't join the Berne Convention or the WTO until later.)  Given , if this work was originally published in the UK in 1923 or later, it would probably still be copyrighted in the US, since it would have been copyrighted in the UK in 1996.There's something else worth noting.  In the US we haven't had any old works enter the public domain in the last 20 years due to a retroactive copyright extension.  However, in 2019, assuming there's not another retroactive extension, works from 1923 will enter the public domain.  By 2025, all published works from 1929 and before should be in the public domain in the US.."}
{"question":" is technically legal, but frowned upon by casinos, because it violates the 'unwritten law' that casinos are supposed to come out ahead. When card counters are caught, casinos can expel them under threat of being charged with trespassing.But apparently casinos sometimes do more than that, like refusing to cash out their chips, or taking card counters to back rooms for questioning. (Detention and questioning are powers supposedly reserved for law enforcement. The casinos are only supposed to detain people until the police arrive.)How do casinos manage to conduct such  proceedings? Do the police and courts turn a blind eye to them because the casinos are important to the local economy?","answer":"Extrajudicial implies there is some weight of law behind the casino behaviors you describe.I don't think there is.For example, refusing to cash out chips could just be a management intimidation tactic to try to coerce the customer into agreeing to be 'questioned.' Which the customer would be under no legal obligation to do.Card counting can't be proven if the counter is not using a device of any kind. The casino can refuse to serve the customer and expel the customer but they can't unilaterally keep the customer's money by not cashing the customer's chips without a judgment.I am not an attorney. This answer is not legal advice."}
{"question":".  As I understand it, first Amendment protects unpopular speech, but is confined and not unlimited.  The classic example is that one can not yell \"fire\" in a crowded movie theatre and incite a panicked exodus.I imagine free speech as a box: if the speech is within the box the content is protected by the first amendment.  Using the box analogy, Why is the Gillars radio broadcast not protected under the first amendment? How exactly did the Gillars broadcast \"cross the line\"?","answer":"It might be more helpful to reverse the analogy.Unprotected speech is a box, and everything that doesn't fit inside the box is free speech.The box is small and strangely shaped, and therefore, very few things will fit inside. The government has spent centuries trying to cram things into it, so we have a pretty good idea of what fits and what doesn't:Content-based restrictions on speech have been permitted, as a general matter, only when confined to the few historic and traditional categories of expression long familiar to the bar. Among these categories are:advocacy intended, and likely, to incite imminent lawless action, see ;obscenity, see, e.g., ;defamation, see, e.g., ;speech integral to criminal conduct, see, e.g., ;so-called fighting words, see ;child pornography, see ;fraud, see ;true threats, see ; andspeech presenting some grave and imminent threat the government has the power to prevent, see .These categories have a historical foundation in the Court's free speech tradition. The vast realm of free speech and thought always protected in our tradition can still thrive, and even be furthered, by adherence to those categories and rules..Although I don't know that I've ever seen the Supreme Court acknowledge it explicitly, one of the common threads you'll see in most of these categories is that First Amendment protection begins to weaken when words are spoken with some kind of ill intent and are likely to cause some kind of societal harm.So the Gillars case falls into the &quot;speech integral to criminal conduct&quot; category. She appealed her conviction on First Amendment grounds, but the D.C. Circuit affirmed. Although the First Amendment would protect someone who hated the American government and went on the radio to denounce the American government, it does not protect those who commit the act of treason, even if speech is their weapon:There is no question in our mind that words may be an integral part of the commission of the crime if the elements which constitute treason are present; that is, if there is adherence to and the giving of aid and comfort to the enemy by an overt act proved by two witnesses, with intention to betray, though the overt act be committed through speech. ...While the crime is not committed by mere expressions of opinion or criticism, words spoken as part of a program of propaganda warefare, in the course of employment by the enemy in its conduct of war against the United States, to which the accused owes allegiance, may be an integral part of the crime. There is evidence in this case of a course of conduct on behalf of the enemy in the prosecution of its war against the United States. The use of speech to this end, as the evidence permitted the jury to believe, made acts of words. The First Amendment does not protect one from accountability for words as such..This is probably one of the least-developed exceptions to First Amendment protection, and therefore one of the hardest to understand. For a deep dive, I'd recommend ."}
{"question":"I understand that a trustee is obligated to execute the terms of a trust and manage the trust assets on behalf of the beneficiaries.

To what extent must the trust details be disclosed?To the extent that the law requires (e.g. to tax authorities, or courts) and to the extent and to whoever is in the best interests of the beneficiaries for it to be disclosed.You are making a mistake in thinking that the beneficiaries have any say in how the trustee operates the trust - the beneficiaries don't decide what their best interests are: the trustee does. Providing the trustee abides by their fiduciary duty (i.e. they act in accordance with the trust deed, the law, prudently and reasonably in the beneficiaries' best interest (as a collective and as judged by the trustee)) then it is not open to the beneficiaries (either as individuals or a collective) to second guess them. Of course, if the trustee breaches that duty then the anyone with standing (which would include the beneficiaries) could ask the court to intervene - its certainly arguable that refusing to provide the beneficiaries with details of the operation of the trust may be a breach of that duty - but maybe not."}
{"question":"While I know that in common law countries there's no legal requirement to provide assistance, is there any liability for failing to do so once you've volunteered to?I'm interested both in a general answer, and in a hypothetical variation of the following specific example: A boy was dangling from a chairlift. The attendant relied on guests to hold the firemen's net stretched in order to catch the boy when he fell.Say I'm in that situation, one of these guests, and I'm holding up my end of the net, but change my mind and let it go. What is the threshold where I would be committing a crime or opening up myself to civil liability? If I let go after the boy already starts falling? What if I let go before he falls, but while still knowing there is no time to find someone to replace me?I'm interested mainly in North American common law context (US and Canada except Quebec).","answer":"While there is no legal requirement to provide assistance, there is in many jurisdictions no liability shield protecting an ordinary civilian (not police\/fire\/EMS) if their actions cause harm. If you witness someone having a heart attack, and you give CPR and by doing so crack a rib, you can be held liable for some or all of the resulting medical bills for said rib, or even for the heart attack itself if you get the wrong judge and jury on the wrong day.Case in point, if you're holding the net at any point (and are thus a 'good Samaritan'), but then release your hold on the net with no opportunity for a replacement, resulting in harm to the person jumping\/falling, you can be held liable for that damage. Without a shield law, all the plaintiff would have to prove is that your action was the proximate cause of his harm (that had you not dropped the net, he would have been significantly less harmed, or unharmed). A fairly low bar, frnakly.'Good Samaritan' laws generally provide immunity from liability in cases where a reasonable person would have done the same thing you did. That raises the bar for the plaintiff, as they must now prove negligence; that your actions are not what a reasonable person would have done because said reasonable person would have recognized too great a risk of additional harm.Some states, not all, have this shield law. In a few of those states, case law has lowered the threshold to demonstrate negligent behavior, significantly weakening the protection of the law (the case law for instance may assume a 'reasonable man' attempting to give CPR has taken a CPR course, identifying an inherent risk in an untrained person doing it, so attempting to give CPR without having taken the course is negligence in itself)."}
{"question":"A hypothetical: let's say I am employed in the U.S., and in a field where I am compensated for the results of my ideas or intellectual work, i.e. engineering.Let's say I have a roughly standard employment agreement and NDA with common stipulations, such as:I further acknowledge that all inventions, original works of authorship, developments, concepts, know-how, improvements or trade secrets which are made by me within the scope of and during the period of my Relationship with the Company are \"works made for hire\" [...]This clause makes a lot of sense and protects the company and their shareholders from questions regarding who owns what -- they company pays me to come up with stuff, and they own it!

There may be a requirement for the business to clearly delimit what they are laying claim to. So if there are clauses exempting works created by the employee wholely on their own time, not using company property including confidential trade secrets, which in not directly related to the company's business including anticipated developments, then that clearly delimits what the company can claim. An expression like &quot;in the course of employment with the company&quot; is vague and could refer to &quot;during that time period&quot; or to &quot;as a result of&quot;. If the intent is &quot;during that time period&quot;, then you should say it that way, and perhaps the candidate will decide to not take the position. Since the company gets to write the contract, the courts will interpret ambiguous language against the interest of the contract's author.If the contract is written differently for copyright versus patents, then patents could be handled differently. The main difference between patents vs. copyright is that patents are more valuable, so the company has a stronger incentive to snag all patents, but this is not a function of the law."}
{"question":"Apartment owner B, claims a leak from apartment owner A above, supposedly damaged a very small portion of B's hallway floor. Owner A offered to replace the hallway floor.Instead owner B insists that owner A must replace entire flooring in the entire apartment since B claims the new portion of the floor in the hallway, will not match 100% cosmetically with the rest of the undamaged apartment floor.Can owner B sue for damages to replace all of the flooring in the entire apartment even though only a very small isolated portion was damaged? And if so, what are the chances of B winning?Jurisdiction: US, Florida","answer":"Both outcomes are possible. A's insurance company would resist full replacement, so B would probably have to sue and prove that full replacement was necessary. Since the basic idea behind compensation is making the person whole after having been harmed, and what is the harm in a more limited repair job? The jury would contemplate all of the details regarding B's apartment. Then it matters just how crisp the floor was originally, and how aesthetically offensive a mere 99% match would be.

{"question":"If one feels that the law is not clear enough, or might have loopholes that should be fixed, how would one go about starting a process to possibly amend it?For example, in Texas, a lot of landlords charge exuberant fees for residential lease re-assignment, even if the tenant goes about finding a new person to whom the lease would be reassigned all by themselves.  E.g., not only would the new tenant still need to pay application and administrative fees (which often amount to 200 USD in Texas), but also the old tenant would still have to pay a non-trivial re-letting fee (which I've seen being anywhere from 200 USD to 85% of the monthly rent).  This doesn't make much sense.","answer":"Call, write, or visit the office of your legislative representative.   can help you figure out who that is.  They have the ability to introduce a bill into the legislature that would change the law, and that's the best way to change a law like what you're trying to do here.  Be sure to tell the legislator exactly what you think should be changed (e.g. 'We should change section ABC of the Texas Property Code, &lt; citation>, to say that 'no landlord can charge a fee of more than X for Y in Z conditions,' or something similar.')  Then concisely summarize your reasons why.  Consider consulting  for more strategy on who and how to ask to increase the probability of success.Be sure to give some consideration to the reason why the landlords charge such fees and the costs they have to incur associated with lease assignments\/changes.  Try to craft a proposal that addresses those concerns, perhaps in some alternative way, and communicate the degree to which you think you understand and have addressed those opposing views.  Also try to think about what new challenges or issues would arise if your proposal went into the law.The job of your representative and\/or their staff includes listening to (a concise presentation of) your concerns and how you think the law should be changed, and representing those views in the legislature.  S\/he also has other constituents, including landlords, to answer to as well, and has to balance those potentially opposing interests before deciding what (if anything) to do.  The degree to which you think the representative listens and represents your interests may determine whose campaign you support (including who you vote for and what you say to your friends\/neighbors\/family) in the next election. Another strategy is to negotiate with your next landlord to take those fees out of your lease agreement, and then the contract which governs your specific agreement might be changed to address this concern.   If you want to change the law for everybody, you might have to convince a lot of people that it's a good idea.  If you want to change the 'law' for what affects you personally, you might only have to convince one person (your own landlord) that such a change is a good idea, at least in your case.   "}

{"question":"Under most (or possibly all) cases ideas are not protected by copyright (or some other IP). Is there a reason for this?

The factors that limit the activities of any militia or similar group are the same that oversee all of us: state and federal laws.To begin with, any such militia or group may run afoul of laws if they are perceived to be attempting to confuse the public and state\/federal governments of their legitimacy and actual command. And, of course, the federal government will not allow an ad-hoc militia group to subvert their own authority. A self-organized militia of ex-military types could self-assign 'missions' of any nature, as long as they did not break applicable state and federal laws for firearms, applicable laws that require permits for assembly and parades in public spaces, laws regarding threats and intimidation while in public, and laws regarding , among others.These 'missions' could be patrolling cities and reporting crimes and helping old ladies cross the street, like an armed version of the .Such militias organize and authorize their own 'missions', much like any group, like the Boy Scouts.

As a part of that effort, \"proof\" of the legitimacy of their ongoing fight is the existence of legal claims they are filing in court.The courts in this scenario have found that not only are these suits without merit,  they often do not even pass the frivolous standard and are otherwise ridden with legal errors unbefitting of any serious attempt to actually win in court.  Thus, they have had multiple cases dismissed,  yet they find ways of continuing to file different objections to the government action to show the people that they are asking for money from that they are still fighting and can absolutely win this thing.Does using the courts in this way violate any law other than the individual sanctions for improper suits?

The closest we could come would be reading &quot;A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury&quot; as saying that the information is both accurate and under penalty of perjury.  Even if we ignore the fact that that would add a stray comma (as comma errors are not uncommon), that still leaves us with &quot;that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly in-fringed&quot; after an additional comma.  This would need a conjunction (such as &quot;and&quot;) that is not there in order for it to read at all correctly.On the other hand, it is perfectly grammatical to read it as:A statement:that the information in the notification is accurate, andunder penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.This would mean that only the statement that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright holder is made under penalty of perjury.  Thus, the &quot;statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized&quot; described in?512(c)(3)(a)(v) and referenced in your second question is not made under penalty of perjury.I couldn't find any case law regarding this, though, which brings us to the second question:<h3>Has anyone ever actually been convicted of perjury as a result of sending a DMCA notice that lied about the &quot;good faith belief&quot; in the infringing nature of the target material?<\/h3>As far as I can tell, no one has ever even been criminally prosecuted for sending false DMCA notices, let alone convicted.

{"question":"Several states had trigger laws that automatically banned abortion when Roe v Wade was overturned. Could a state pass a law banning all firearms effective upon the repeal of the Second Amendment?","answer":"Yes, a state could pass such a  &quot;trigger law&quot;. If properly worded, it would probably be enforceable, should the Second Amendment ever be repealed, 0or should the court decisions applying it to the state be overturned or significantly modified.For the matter of that, a state could pass a law banning all firearms tomorrow. But under ) of the US Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts, it would be largely if not totally unenforceable.Nothing stops a state (or Congress, or a local government) from passing unconstitutional laws. But when a government attempts to enforce such laws, the defense may challenge them as unconstitutional, and therefore not valid. If the court accepts that contention, the law is not enforced, and any previous proceedings or penalties under it may be overturned.I think it quite unlikely that the Congress would pass, and the states ratify, a repeal of the  Second Amendment in the foreseeable future, although one never knows for sure what legislators will do.However, current case law is not incompatible with some laws regulating guns, although a total ban cannot be justified under current case law, as I understand it. For example, Heller includes the statement that:Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. [It is] not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. ... nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.Later cases have upheld some firearms restrictions.In United States v. Hayes, 555 U.S. 415, (2009) the Supreme Court upheld a federal statute  barring people convicted of domestic violence crimes from owning guns and the use of this law by state regulators.In United States v. Castleman, 134 S. Ct. 1405 (2014) the judgment, the Supreme Court held that a state conviction for misdemeanor domestic assault qualifies as amisdemeanor crime of domestic violence for purposes of possessing a firearm under 18 USC. 922(g)(9)Under these precedents, sates can pass and enforce some restrictions on gun ownership and possession, if they so choose."}

The owners each pay themselves a (reasonable) 150k salary each year, leaving the assets of the LLC itself 0.In the event the LLC is sued, can a court pierce the corporate veil and go after the salaries that the owners paid themselves? If I understand correctly, it would have to justify that by saying the owners used the LLC as their personal bank account, with the intent to shield the money from lawsuits. But in this case the salaries are reasonable amounts, so how can the court prove illegal intent? In general, is there a maximum salary the owners can collect from an LLC before it's considered as 'shielding funds'?","answer":"If your LLC made 300K before paying salaries, and paid 300K total in salaries, that seems quite reasonable. You might have a point if the order of events was: LLC pays 100K in salaries, LLC gets sued for 200K, LLC raises salaries by 200K.Note that the owners have to pay income tax on 300k earnings, plus whatever else employers and employees have to pay. And an LLC doesn't pay salaries to owners, it pays salaries to employees who be sheer coincidence are also owners.It's a different matter if the company pays dividends. A company must keep dividends low enough so that it can run its business, including paying damages for lawsuits that it knows about.

The Secret Service is part of the Department of Homeland Security (formerly part of the Treasury Department, until 2002) which is part of the Executive branch, but I am sure the President cannot order them to arrest someone who has not committed any crime.

There is also the provision in Article I section two that:  The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers;which would include the Sargent-at-Arms, I think. Article I section five says:  Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two thirds, expel a member.which again seems to grant control over the situation to the individual houses of Congress.Article I section 6 says:  The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the treasury of the United States. They shall in all cases, except treason, felony and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other place.which again puts Congress out of the direct control of the President."}
{"question":"The :Generally, an immigration officer cannot detain you without reasonable suspicion.An immigration officer also cannot search you or your belongings without either probable cause or your consent. An immigration officer cannot arrest you without probable cause.Media outlets () reports two women, who were born in the U.S. and are citizens,  were speaking to one another in Spanish while standing in line to buy eggs and milk in a convenience store in Havre. The agent, Paul O'Neill, entered the store, overheard them and kept them in the parking lot for approximately 40 minutes while he checked their identifications.Ma'am, the reason I asked you for your ID is because I came in here and I saw that you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here, O'Neill said in the video.Did the agent have 'reasonable suspicion' to detain the women based on language (assume he did not understand Spanish for this exercise)?What precedent, if any, is there to justify such a lengthy detention?","answer":"It is intuitively crazy to think that speaking Spanish in Montana is evidence of a crime. Still, we will have to wait to see what the courts rule, if it goes that far. We should start with , 392 U.S. 1, which found that  in justifying the particular intrusion, the police officer must be  able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together  with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that  intrusion. The scheme of the Fourth Amendment becomes meaningful only  when it is assured that, at some point, the conduct of those charged  with enforcing the laws can be subjected to the more detached, neutral  scrutiny of a judge who must evaluate the reasonableness of a  particular search or seizure in light of the particular circumstances.  And, in making that assessment, it is imperative that the facts be  judged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the  officer at the moment of the seizure or the search 'warrant a man of  reasonable caution in the belief' that the action taken was  appropriate?The Montana officer did 'articulate' a reason, in saying 'Ma'am, the reason I asked you for your ID is because I came in here and I saw that you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here'. In articulating an excuse, the officer has not passed the test of providing 'rational inferences from those facts'. Of course, the law also does not require an officer to explain his reasoning to the suspect. In Terry, the officer  had never seen the two men before, and he was unable to say  precisely what first drew his eye to them. However, he testified that  he had been a policeman for 39 years and a detective for 35, and that  he had been assigned to patrol this vicinity of downtown Cleveland for  shoplifters and pickpockets for 30 years. He explained that he had  developed routine habits of observation over the years, and that he  would 'stand and watch people or walk and watch people at many  intervals of the day.' He added: 'Now, in this case, when I looked  over, they didn't look right to me at the time.'The reasoning in these cases is quite parallel: an appeal to a subjectively felt unusualness of a circumstance. There may be a factual dispute over how often Spanish (or Nakhota) is spoken in public in Havre, but we may assume that Spanish is spoken much less often than English. Still, a well-grounded belief that a person speaks Spanish (let us stipulate that it is fluent) is not at all evidence that a person has committed a crime. The inference is no more rational than McFadden's inference from 'I don't know you' to 'You must be a criminal'. See , 422 U.S. 873, which held that  an officer whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a  particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country  may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about  their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain  suspicious circumstances... To allow roving patrols the broad and  unlimited discretion urged by the Government to stop all vehicles in  the border area without any reason to suspect that they have violated  any law, would not be 'reasonable' under the Fourth Amendment...The  Fourth Amendment therefore forbids stopping persons for questioning  about their citizenship on less than a reasonable suspicion that they  may be aliens.The court has  refused to find that Mexican ancestry alone supported such a 'founded  suspicion'Speaking Spanish is as much evidence of foreign ancestry as speaking English is (referring to the Nakhota situation, ethnic Nakhota speak English all the time, but they do not have foreign ancestry). See also   Given...inability to speak English, proximity to the border, and  unsuspicious behavior - law enforcement lacked reasonable suspicion  that Appellant and his co-workers were in this country illegally.Moreover, the Manzo Jurado event took place in Havre MT. So the factual question of whether hearing Spanish spoken in Havre is already on the record. Not only is it spoken in Havre, it is spoken by an individual who spoke no English, and it was found by the court to not constitute reasonable suspicion."}
{"question":"I often heard that the US are somehow exceptional in the freedom of speech that they provide to their citizens via the first amendment. However, I never saw an actual comparison with, say, European countries.My question is: In which European country, is it illegal (for a citizen of that European country) to publicly state an opinion that in the US would be protected the first amendment?Is there somewhere a list with such comparison?","answer":"Almost every European nation has a &quot;hate speech&quot; law that makes the use of offensive bigoted words of phrases illegal.  The U.S. does not have any such laws, and the First Amendment makes such laws unconstitutional.The closest the U.S. can get are laws criminalizing &quot;Hate Crimes&quot; which are ordinary crimes which were motivated in part or in whole by the victim's actual or perceived protected class status.Other specific examples as mentioned in comments, are that Germany has strict laws about advocacy of Nazi ideology.  This is completely legal in the United States.  Nazi ideology is not popular in the U.S. by any means, but it's allowed to be advocated for because of the strong Freedom of Speech Laws in the United States.In other regards, while U.S. Law is fairly similar to U.K. Law (you have to get into weeds about the differences), it is way more difficult to sue for defamation in U.S. than in the U.K.  For starters, the U.S. has the &quot;Public Person&quot; rule which requires that any defamation about a person who is largely known to the public (politicians and celebrities largely) must prove Actual Malice Or Reckless Disregard for the Truth (I.E. You didn't even do the basic research into the statement) in order to prove defamation.   But there's also the matter of the burden of proof.  In the U.K. the speaker of the alleged defamation must prove in court that the statement was not defamatory.  In the U.S., all legal challenges to are &quot;protected speech&quot; until proven otherwise in a court of law.  This means that even with the &quot;Public Person&quot; rule set aside, the statement's original speaker need not prove that their speech is truthful, and the burden's on the accuser of defamation to prove it.Edit:Additional Info based on comments, but &quot;Protected Speech&quot; is a legal term used in the U.S. that defines speech that is protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States as opposed to commercial speech, which is speech used to make advertise or to further commerce and is restricted, and unprotected speech, which is speech that can land one in trouble.  While the list of types of speech is long, every form of speech restriction is very very narrowly tailored.   &quot;Hate Speech&quot;, which would be the utterance of words or phrases that can be offensive to people of a protected class (a characteristic that is beyond the individuals control).  &quot;Hate Crimes&quot; are not necessarily spoken during the commission of the crime, but rather can be charged in addition to the crime.  Suppose a serial killer was killing people of a certain race, this is not enough for police to go on because most serial killers target victims that meet a physical description (same skin color, same hair color, same gender).  Once the killer is captured, police search his apartment and find a manifesto where the killer admits that he is selecting his target because he believes people of this protected class are subhuman and thus his superior nature gives him the right to kill them, this would show that the killings were motivated out of hatred, and thus qualify as a hate crime.  The way he phrases this may be purely academic and use in offensive language OR it could be laden with all manner of crass slurs.  It doesn't matter... what he said is protected speech but what he did is... well... to quote Guardians of the Galaxy... is &quot;murder... on of the worst crimes of all. So also illegal.&quot;Hate crimes criminalize crimes that are motivated by hatred... they do not criminalize speech that is hateful."}
{"question":"In the USA, some of the states gambling is illegal. River boats and cruise boats allow gambling because vessels in open water are subject to federal not state law. Applying this logic to aircraft, would a Zeppelin have these same freedoms to allow gambling even if loitering over a state that prohibits gambling?","answer":"Short answer, No.In the United State, all aircraft (even of other countries) may not have gambling devices onboard under   An air carrier or foreign air carrier may not install, transport, or operate, or permit the use of, any gambling device onboard an aircraftIn Russia, gambling was banned in almost every part of Russia in 2009 expect for in the regions of Altai, Krasnodar, Kaliningrad, and Primorsky although I couldn't find any Russian laws against gambling on aircraft, it should be assumed that Russia would enforce its gambling laws on aircraft in its airspace.    In the UK, there are no laws against onboard gambling, it actually seems as if there are quite a few onboard gambling planes that are in operations.  In China, due to the structure of China's government, China has by far the most restrictions on what it's citizens can do in the country and abroad. Yes, you read that right China can and has punished citizens for breaking China's law in other countries (e.g. China's social credit system). gambling in china is illegal under Article 303 of the Criminal Law of the PRC (Criminal Law) (as amended in 1997).To address the underlying question of 'can countries laws apply to the airspace above that country' the answer is yes, airspace isn't the same as international waters. though it could be argued that the government's laws shouldn't apply to the skies as international-law scholar Paul Fauchille did, it has been applied case after case that US law applies to the airspace above the US.

{"question":"I sold a car a year ago in TX and didn't realize that I should take the plates off.  The buyer has taken full advantage of this and is racking up lots of tolls in my name.  Fortunately I'm able to get the tolls dismissed by showing the bill of sale and vehicle transfer form I filed, but they say they won't stop sending me bills until the guy registers the car in his name, so I have the repeated hassle of going to contest these bills.It's annoying enough I'm tempted to try to find the car somewhere I believe he frequents and just take the plates.  I don't know if that would be considered stealing, since I was supposed to remove them anyway, but something tells me this would be a bad idea.  I've had all kinds of ideas, for instance, I found that I still have a non-sentry key, so I could theroetically remove the plates but hide them inside the vehicle, which couldn't possibly be considered stealing but would motivate him to register it.The main thing I wonder is if he could sue me for some kind of monetary damages arising from missing something important because he sees that he suddenly has no plates and doesn't want to risk getting pulled over.  Or gets pulled over on his way to something important, etc.","answer":"License plates in Texas are governed by the Texas TRANSPORTATION CODE, TITLE 7. VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC, SUBTITLE A. CERTIFICATES OF TITLE AND REGISTRATION OF VEHICLES, Texas code section  504.901.  TRANSFER AND REMOVAL OF LICENSE PLATES (subsections (b) and (c)) provide that(b)  On the sale or transfer of a motor vehicle to a person who does not hold a general distinguishing number issued under Chapter 503, [i.e. not a dealer] the seller may remove each license plate issued for the motor vehicle.  The license plates may be transferred to another vehicle titled in the seller's name if the seller obtains:(1)  the department's approval of an application to transfer the license plates; and(2)  a new registration insignia for the motor vehicle.(c)  A license plate removed from a motor vehicle that is not transferred to another motor vehicle must be disposed of in a manner specified by the department.It seems that the seller is not required to remove the plates when selling the vehicleSection 504.010  ISSUANCE AND PLACEMENT OF LICENSE PLATE. provides that:(a)  On payment of the prescribed fee, an applicant for motor vehicle registration shall be issued a license plate or set of platesThis seems to tie the plates to the registration, which means to the person registering them as well as to a particular vehicle.Section  504.943.  OPERATION OF VEHICLE WITHOUT LICENSE PLATE provides that:(a)  Except as provided by Subsection (b), a person commits an offense if the person operates on a public highway, during a registration period, a motor vehicle that does not display two license plates that:(1)  have been assigned by the department for the period; and(2)  comply with department rules regarding the placement of license plates.Section. 504.944.  OPERATION OF VEHICLE WITH WRONG LICENSE PLATE.provides that:A person commits an offense if the person operates, or as the owner permits another to operate, on a public highway a motor vehicle that has attached to it a number plate or registration insignia issued for a different vehicle.  An offense under this section is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $200.It would seem that under 504.943 or 504.944 (and the related 504.945) the person who bought is committing a misdemeanor  every time that the person drives it on public roads or streets. The seller could inform the buyer of this and request the buyer to get new plates, or report the buyer to the police as having improper plates, which would allow them to stop the buyer for having improper plates. Use of certified mail would preserve a record of the notification of the buyer. Note that notification is in no way required before reporting to the police, but might induce the buyer to get new plates on his or her own.Secretly removing the buyer's license plate would probably not be theft, as it seems that the plates actually remain the property of the state, but would at the least involve trespass. It seems unwise at best."}
{"question":"BackgroundOn occasion, the Supreme Court  no longer does, and no longer has the force of law.  It is as if that part of the law no longer exists.QuestionI was curious about the big picture long term ramifiactions of overturning precedent. Once precedent is overturned, what happens to the other laws that cite the overturned portion, or overturned case? And does this effect cascade, i.e. do cases that cite cases that cite a case overturned in whole or in part also get overturned?","answer":"When the US Supreme Court 'overturns' a precedent, it does not usually mean that every case which previously cited the older holding instantly vanishes or is upset. Indeed, often the older case is not truly overturned, but 'distinguished', meaning the circumstances of the new case are different enough that the old rule does not apply. But, at least in theory, a case exactly similar to the old one would still follow the old rule. Sometimes such 'distinguishing' cases pile up until nothing is left of the old rule. Even when one case overturns an earlier one more dramatically, it may not be instantly total. For example, West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish (1937) directly overturned Adkins v. Children's Hospital (1923) and by implication Lochner v. New York (1905) But the tide had started to turn against Lochner some years earlier in  Nebbia v. New York (1934), and Lochner continued to be cited favorably in some cases until  United States v. Carolene Products Co. (1938). In Lincoln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron &amp; Metal Co (1949) Justice Black (appointed 1937) wrote that the  Lochner  line of cases had been 'repudiated'.A more dramatic case of an overturned precedent was West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943) (the 2nd flag salute case)  which directly ruled the exact opposite of Minersville School District v. Gobitis, 310 U.S. 586 (1940). The membership of the court was largely the same, and the time lapse quite short. The Court essentially changed its collective mind, largely adopting the view of the dissent in the earlier case.Another example of an extreme reversal is Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), which denied that any black could be a US citizen. This was overturned by the outcome of the US Civil War, and the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments.In general when an earlier case is overruled, the change is not retroactive. Old cases are not undone. But new cases will be less likely to cite the overturned case (except possibly as a bad example), and it will no longer be considered good law to mandate a decision in a lower court. This is particularly true if several new cases, over a period of time, follow the new rule or principle.  "}

His daughter lives there, at least part of the time, and is quite confrontational with anyone who talks with her about it.Animal Control says the burden of proof is on me.Animal Control suggested that we set up an camera and film their back yard.Q: Is this legal? Do I have any other recourse?","answer":"Whether or not this is legal hinges on the level of  that your neighbour would\/should have.Can your neighbour expect privacy in their backyard? It depends.For example, if their yard is on top of a hill surrounded by blind 7ft high fence, then no person outside would normally see what is inside, and so they pretty much can expect privacy there. If, however, your property is high enough so that you can see their backyard from your balcony, then they would know that and therefore they would not be able to expect absolute privacy. Needless to say, if they have low\/look-through\/no fence, then pretty much everyone can see what is happening in their back yard and so there will be no expectation of privacy at all.As a rule of thumb, if you can see something without entering the property, drilling holes in fences or using special equipment (tele lens, drones etc.), you can film it."}

In most cases if the winner has not done anything dishonest or weird, they will never come into effect. They are to avoid risks to the contest organizers in rare cases. For example, suppose the winner was under a contract to hand over any prizes to a creditor, and the creditor sued because the prize was paid directly to the winner. The organizers don't want to be liable on any such suit. Other possible but unusual cases could be imagined where the liability release might apply.If the winner signs the liability release, s\/he will be agreeing to pay any legal damages any suit might impose on the sponsor or contest organizers or related parties because someone (including the winner) sues because of something the winner did, or something related to the winner having participated and won.

For example, say it's the '80s and someone wants to structure a CDO for the first time. We all know from the financial crisis that nobody really understood how much these things were actually worth. So what legal basis under corporate accounting rules do these companies have to put such a thing on their balance sheets?

Accountants that monkey around and don't follow GAAP are putting their professional credentials in significant peril.Furthermore, anyone who has lived through the last decade is likely to be very wary of Level 3 assets and liabilities.

{"question":"If a corporation has a director who doesn't actually do much and is just there to fulfill a legal requirement, and the director does not want to be paid, is that legal? What about a $1\/year salary? Does it matter if the director is a shareholder?","answer":"A member of the board of directors of a corporation does not have to be paid, and can likewise be paid only a nominal amount. Members of the board of directors in closely held companies are rarely paid for that service, although some pay for members of the board of directors is the norm in publicly held corporations.Most members of the board of directors in closely held companies are managers, owners, or representatives of owners of the company, who derived economic rewards from the company primarily in those roles. Compensation for outside directors in publicly held companies reflects the fact that these directors, collectively, typically own only a tiny percentage of the stock of the company upon whose board they serve and by definition are not employed by the company in another capacity. So, the value of their contributions is often not fully captured by other means of receiving economic rewards from the company.Payments for serving as a member of the board of directors of a corporation, at least when one is not also an employee of the corporation, are classified as self-employment income.Members of the board of directors who are not also employees of the corporation are usually considered independent contractors rather than employees."}

{"question":"As many tabletop and also computer games have quite unique themes for characters I'm wondering there if those can be copyrighted and thus similar ideas brought to court for copyright infringement?As example if we take a computer game like Prototype. Then the character theme would be 'undead shapechanger who needs to absorb others in order to take on their shape and needs to absorb his own kind in order to increase his powers'. Going mainly there about European law, but I think US law is similar enough there.","answer":"Copyright protects expression, not ideas. However, it is possible for characters to be protected if they are sufficiently developed, especially distinctive, and become the expression rather than just a vehicle for expression. The delineation of idea\/expression with regard to fictional characters is not uniform across jurisdictions (it even differs between US districts).I should emphasize that this is a case-by-case analysis, and it would be impossible to give a blanket 'yes' or 'no' answer to this question, but a 'general character theme' would likely not be protected by copyright, if I have understood your use of that phrase correctly."}

{"question":"Let's say I invented  which turns trash into money. Can I legally:Take the trash from a trash deposit container outside my neighbor's house, without asking permission?Go to the landfill, load some trash into my truck, then drive away?","answer":"I'll assume a real question here and not one about a fan film on YouTube.  Take the trash from a trash deposit container outside my neighbor's  house, without asking permission?All depends on the locality; and sometimes the law is not settled, either. Some cities have passed laws that deem trash to be city's property as soon as it is placed in a city-supplied trash bin, because the city (or a private contractor) hauls to and owns the landfill. Other cities claim legal ownership of recyclables when placed on the curb, for the obvious reason that they are worth money. The law can be not settled if objects are in alleys and not in trash bins, or simply placed on the curb.For the sake of discussion, there are numerous examples of cities looking the other way with scavengers and pickers; it all depends on the location and the enforcement. (And, there are examples of the police being able to legally pull evidence from trash; but that's not the question here.)  Go to the landfill, load some trash into my truck, then drive away?Think about it: you're obviously not going to be able to do this in a location with a managed landfill with employees that check you in and take your tipping fee. If it's a private trash contractor, it's private property; for a city, it's probably against the contract you signed when you paid to dump and probably against city law to salvage from the landfill, for liability reasons. (That doesn't mean the employees at the landfill can't salvage themselves; that's up to them.)But like anything, at an unmanaged landfill in a rural area, you could probably get away with it."}
{"question":"In a situation where someone is subleasing part of a residential property from a master tenant , but finds themselves in the position to purchase the property from the landlord. In other words, what if a roommate buys the house you are living in? How might this be viewed from the conflict of tenant rights of both the master tenant and the previously-subtenant, in California?If there are ongoing disputes with the sublandlord and subtenant. If the sublease has not terminated when ownership is transferredIf the sublease is co-tenancy (both tenant and subtenant - now landlord occupy the property) I guess in commercial property world it is not unheard of someone subleasing back space from their own lessee.","answer":"Just think of the subtenant cum owner as two separate people with two separate roles.Tenant = TSubtenant = STOld owner = OONew Owner = NOThe rights of the tenant vis-avis the new owner will be informed by the lease and the local laws. Generally, if the sale happens in the middle of the existing lease, the NO is obligated by the terms, as is the T. NO cannot just kick T out, and T cannot just break the lease. The lease may say what could happen and local laws will apply. Likewise, ST has whatever contract with T that previously existed. Pretend NO and ST are different people. If T owes NO $1000 per month, and ST owes T $400 a month, that continues even though ST and NO are the same person. Depends on what kind of dispute.See above. All contracts continue, subject to whatever the lease with the original owner and the subtenancy agreement say abut modifying or breaking the lease and sublease. Local laws apply. Note, if the subtenancy was 'off the books' or was done when not allowed by the original owner, and if it was not in a place that the local law says owners cannot deny subleasing, then tenant might not have any protection. ST, now that he is owner could just move out and stop paying. On the other hand, even if he is the owner, he cannot just say 'I am the owner now, so I am moving back in for free' because the original lease gave the tenant use of the whole property. But ST could just drop out because T always owed OO, and now NO, the full rent. Do you mean if rather than sublease, they were both on the original lease? Interesting, but just imagine it as the obligations before the sale = the obligations after the sale. I don't know though. There are some tax implications for an owner occupied rental.    "}
{"question":"In  a suspect has a can of soda with a bag of cocaine inside. While trying to get the guy to admit to possession, a police officer tells the suspect that the weight of the entire package would be what he's charged with possession, saying it weighs about a pound (implying that the soda can's weight is included). I know that police officers in the United States are allowed to lie. Is this an example of the officer lying to the suspect to get him to admit to a smaller amount of cocaine, or is it true that for some reason the weight of the container is included when charging people for possession?","answer":"There is a slim chance that it is truish, depending on whose law you are asking about, and also depending on the facts (if the drug was in a baggie, it's unclear; it is was mixed with the soda, it's clear and it's true). As far as I know, the 'baggie in can' theory has not been put to the appellate test (perhaps that is evidence that the can does not count). However, in the case , are some of the current laws, which repeated use the formula 'mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of').The question that would arise is whether a can containing a bag of something is a 'substance' or 'mixture'. The ordinary meaning of 'mixture' precludes that interpretation, but of course you also have to look at the legislative history to determine what Congress's intent was in writing these laws. Saying that a can with a bag is a 'substance' is also counter-intuitive, but not as plainly unreasonable as calling a can and a bag a 'mixture'. In Chapman, the court observed that 'Congress clearly intended the dilutant, cutting agent, or carrier medium to be included in the weight of those drugs for sentencing purposes', but again you might interpret 'carrier medium' as referring to something other than 'the means of carrying the drug' \u2013 'carrier medium' is not statutorily defined, and its 'plain meaning' is broad (but also note that the statute doesn't mention 'carrier medium'). In its ruling, the court appeals to 'the history of Congress's attempts to control illegal drug distribution', and a careful study of all of the pertinent documents for this case might definitively rule in vs. out an interpretation that the weight of the container is to be included.An obvious ludicrous consequence of including container weight is that if you are arrested for possession of a trace amount of a drug, found in your car, the weight of the car is to be considered and you get life in prison. It is plausible that the officer has a vague acquaintance with the Chapman-type ruling, and has misapplied the law, thus he has a good-faith belief that his claim is legally correct (thus he did not lie, he was simply wrong). Perhaps some DA has pursued the 'drug plus can-weight' theory, but I doubt that has happened."}
{"question":"The U.S. Constitution's 'Commerce Clause' (Article I, Section 8) grants the federal government authority to regulate interstate commerce.  The same section contains the 'Taxing and Spending Clause' which grants the federal government authority to 'lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.'Has federal law drawn a line on what taxes, duties, etc., can be collected by the states?Evidently the states can tax (a) income and property of citizens and entities within their borders; (b) commerce (via sales and excise taxes) conducted within their borders.  Has any restraint been imposed on such taxation, other than  (SCOTUS, 2015)?One prohibition I suspect exists, but I can't find in law: Can states impose duties on goods that merely transit their territory?","answer":"  Are there any restrictions on the taxes or duties a U.S. state can levy?Yes.  For starters, states may not use taxes or other means to impede the federal government in its constitutional exercises of power.  This precedent stems from a case called  from 1819.  In 1816, Congress established the Second Bank of the United States.  Many states were not fans of this action.  One of them, Maryland, established a tax on all notes of banks not chartered in Maryland.  When the head of the Baltimore branch of the bank refused to pay the tax, litigation commenced and it was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court.  SCOTUS held that the Constitution grants implied powers to Congress that allow Congress to implement a national government using its express powers and state action may not interfere with such exercise of power.  Taxation, of course, is just one way a state may attempt to interfere with federal power.   Can states impose duties on goods that merely transit their territory?Generally .  The Commerce Clause bars states from implementing taxes that discriminate against interstate commerce or that put burdens on it by subjecting commercial activities to numerous or unfair taxation.  The Due Process Clause complements this concept by requiring there be a definitive link between a state and the person, property, or transaction which it seeks to tax. This goes back to the SCOTUS decision in Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona where the state enacted a law barring trains from operating in the state with more than 14 or 70 passenger or freight cars, respectively.  The Court held that this was a substantial burden on interstate commerce because trains would need to be broken up before they passed through AZ.  Also, you couldn't just stop on the tracks and 'break up' the trains, so that had to be done at a stop before getting to AZ.  The court determined that with this law, AZ effectively controlled the length of trains as far from its borders as El Paso and Los Angeles.  The alternative was to operate all trains at the lowest level allowable by any state, which would lead to AZ dictating train lengths around the country.  In determining the validity of the law or regulation, a court uses a balancing test to compare the burden on interstate commerce with the importance of the state interest (the AZ law was purportedly for safety reasons).

{"question":"There is a question  which asks a similar thing and the answer there seems to be yes, but the evidence presented seems to me to be inconclusive at best. Since it only implies that the notice of alibi requirement is constitutional, but the notice only says the court MAY exclude the alibi if it has not been disclosed.The goal of the statue as read seems to be more expediency and efficiency of proceedings though and the argument being that alibis can be easily falsified, here assuming that witnesses can be coerced\/bought\/or just sympathetic (mom in one case where this was raised) but there is evidence that is quiet hard to falsify such as public video recordings or witness testimony from large amounts of unrelated people.Is it realistic that a court would exclude such testimony due to it not being disclosed timely?","answer":"Yes, this happens with some regularity.In the absence of timely notice, courts should generally permit the alibi testimony, assuming that prosecution will not be surprised or prejudiced by the late notice and that the lack of notice was not the result of bad faith.But when that's not the case, courts can and definitely do exclude alibi testimony: (&quot;The record demonstrates that the prosecution was unaware of Reed's alibi, and it had no opportunity to investigate the claim.

{"question":"Consider the following scenario: Witness (not defendant) asked to testify at a civil case at a state court. Witness takes the fifth out of nowhere, that is at a completely unexpected place in testimony where it appears there is nothing even remotely connected to the case could possibly result in a fifth amendment, with the obvious conclusion that the fifth amendment is being taken for something the court doesn't even know about yet. The state grants immunity from prosecution to get testimony.But the crime covered by the fifth amendment is a federal crime and the state granted immunity.Is the fifth amendment protection broken, or did the state just bind the federal government to not prosecute something?I am aware that the state usually doesn't grant blanket immunity (all possible charges revealed by testimony rather than a list beforehand), but if they are intent on compelling testimony and they don't know what the crime being covered is, and they have no way to find out ...Perhaps there's a way to invoke the fifth in such a manner as to get immunity from the right court, but there is no documentation readily available on the matter. But in that case we have to consider what happens of the federal court refuses to grant immunity. Hint: if the state is a party to a civil case they're likely to grant immunity, but why would a federal judge care?","answer":"There are two kinds of immunity: formal and informal. They have different consequences.Informal immunity is an agreement between the defendant and the prosecutor's office, after which the defendant voluntarily gives testimony. Because the defendant is voluntarily giving testimony, they're waiving their Fifth Amendment privilege. The prosecutor will be held to their agreement, and it's possible that other prosecutors under the same sovereign are held to the agreement, but the agreement doesn't bind other governments. Because your statement under informal immunity was voluntary and you waived your Fifth Amendment privilege, other governments can use those statements against you. There might be an exception to that rule if the two governments were working together to trick you, but if they were working independently there's no issue with the second government using the statements.Formal immunity is when a court orders you to testify notwithstanding Fifth Amendment privilege. This does bind other governments, but not as broadly as you seem to think. The minimum level of immunity for compelled testimony is called 'use and derivative use immunity:' the government can't use the compelled testimony or any evidence derived from it against you. It does not prevent the government from prosecuting you with evidence they got independently. Informal immunity is more flexible (since it's an agreement), but informal immunity also often takes the form of 'we won't use what you say against you' instead of 'we won't prosecute you for X.'Some states require transactional immunity to compel testimony (that's where you can't be prosecuted for any crime you admit to during the questioning as long as the admission was actually relevant to the question). However, this goes beyond the requirements of the Fifth Amendment, so it's not binding on other governments. Other governments are only bound (under the federal constitution) by use and derivative use immunity. See  for discussion of the federal government having to comply with use and derivative use immunity principles if a state court compels testimony."}

{"question":"Lets say someone doesn't want to serve jury duty.  He shows up when summoned but states to the judge in no uncertain terms that he intends to vote guilty, regardless of the content of the case, if he is made a juror.Obviously he will be strike as a Juror.  However, I'm curious if there is any penalty he would suffer for the threat of dereliction of his duty as a juror, or if he would just be allowed to get what he wants and go on his merry way?","answer":"Often, you aren't screened only for one trial, but for several trials. If you declare yourself biased for one trial, you might be asked to be considered for a second, or third, etc.If you continue to give answers that make yourself ineligible such that the judge does not believe you are telling the truth or acting in good faith, you can be held in contempt of court."}

{"question":"I was discussing  with a friend, and he came up with this puzzle:Supposing Company A is facing a lawsuit, has received a judgment against them in a district court, and has filed an appeal. During this time, Company A is also looking to sell the relevant business and associated liabilities to Company B, but Company B insists on an unusual term of sale: should the appeals court dismiss Company A's appeal of the district court's judgment as moot, the sale shall be void. Company B does not intervene in the case.Now, plaintiffs, pointing to the sale of the business to Company B, move to dismiss Company A's appeal as moot. The appeals court faces the following problem:Should the appeals court grant the appeal, Company B will have no stake in the outcome, and so the appellate decision will be purely advisory. On the other hand, should the appeals court dismiss the appeal as moot, Company B will in fact incur liability for the judgment and thus will have a stake in the outcome.How do courts deal with self-referential situations like this that create paradoxes?","answer":"I'll limit my analysis to the situation you describe, and without reading the appellate opinion.Side note: Here you portray that Company B said to Company A: 'If you no longer are liable as per this ruling, I'm not interested in acquiring you'. For the sake of argument, one may assume that judgement is about money (rather than certain types of act, see below), and that Company B has ulterior motives for the transaction such as money laundering. However, generally speaking it just makes no sense for Company B to require something like that.A dismissal as moot means that the ruling appealed has no (or no longer has) legal effect, and that there is nothing that can be restored to Company A. Thus, Company A's situation is similar as if no judgment against it were in place.In its motion to dismiss, Company A may argue that the appeal is moot, but that does not guarantee that the appellate court will reflect the alleged mootness. Instead, the appellate order is likelier to reflect that Company A withdrew its appeal. Thus, mootness is not established, and that prevents the sale from becoming void. In few words, Company A's self-referential move preempts mootness.If the judgment consists of ordering Company A to perform an act, Company A could devise mootness by performing the act, and bringing that up to the appellate court's attention in a way that leads the appellate court to identify sua spone the occurrence of mootness. But keep in mind that the act in question must be one which can be neither reversed nor compensated for. A money judgment is no such act, as reimbursement of payments can always be ordered.Regardless, the scenario outlined in the previous paragraph is different from the self-referential situation you describe."}

All of them?Which of these states could file charges against the person? Could the federal government file charges as well? Would more than one prosecution violate the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment?What if these were countries instead of states?This can also happen for possible cybercrimes as well. For example, if I use a Canadian Wi-Fi network without authorization from within the United States, would US or Canadian law apply?","answer":"Suppose I live in State A, but am on vacation to State B. While onvacation, suppose someone living in State C, but currently in State D,accesses my bank account to take money out illegally. The bank has acentral headquarters in State E, although my branch of the bank is inState F.In which of these states could I file a lawsuit? Any of them? All ofthem?The thief would be the defendant in a lawsuit brought by you. The fact that you are on vacation in State B is irrelevant.You can always sue someone where they are domiciled, so State C is one forum where you could sue the thief. You can also always sue a natural person (as opposed to an entity) in a State where they are physically served with process, so if a summons from the courts of State D were served upon the thief while the thief was in State D, then State D could handle the case.You could also probably sue in State A on the grounds that intangible property is deemed to be located where the owner is domiciled and the theft of intangible property was a harm directed a State A. But, there is an argument that if the thief has no way you knowing that you lived in State A as opposed to State F where your branch is locate, that the thief's actions were targeted at State F. State E would not be a very plausible state to argue that there is jurisdiction.A federal district court has geographic jurisdiction only over cases that could be heard in the state courts of the state where it is located, so a federal court case would be brought only in the states where a state lawsuit could be brought. A federal court cases would either have to seek at least $75,000 (since there is diversity of citizenship between you and the thief), or would have to state at least one theory arising under federal law (which might or might not apply to this case).The you can choose which state to file in from those that are available.Which of these states could file charges against the person?A state can prosecute if the crime happened there, or if the crime caused a harm there. In this case the answer to both of those questions could be muddy. Basically, State A or F is probably where the crime caused harm, and it isn't clear from the OP facts where the crime was committed by the thief (we only know where the thief is now).These acts would also probably violate some federal crime that could be prosecuted in federal court, mostly likely the federal courts in State A or State F.Which of these states could file charges against the person? Could thefederal government file charges as well? Would more than oneprosecution violate the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment?What if these were countries instead of states?The double jeopardy clause applies to prosecutions within a single U.S. state,  and in addition to any state prosecutions, a single prosecution can be made at the federal level. Likewise, prosecutions in different countries do not count against each other for purposes of a double jeopardy clause.Many U.S. states have a binding or non-binding policy of not prosecuting crimes that have already been prosecuted by another U.S. state or by the federal government, the U.S. Justice Department likewise has a non-binding policy of not prosecuting cases which have already been prosecuted by a U.S. state or another country. But these policies do not have constitutional dimensions and are not required by the 5th Amendment.if I use a Canadian Wi-Fi network without authorization from withinthe United States, would US or Canadian law apply?In criminal cases, choice of law and jurisdiction over the case are the same thing, because a state or country can only apply its own criminal laws.In civil cases, choice of law is a question distinct from jurisdiction. A court applies the law with the most significant connection to the disputed legal issue in question (sometimes more than one set of laws in a multi-issue case), even if it is the law of a different state or country, which is a standard that affords a judge considerable discretion. Either U.S. law or Canadian law could be plausible to apply in this case depending on the detailed circumstances and the legal issue that is disputed."}
{"question":"The town where we own a rental property had a meeting for landlords (by which I mean owners of rental property) recently.Those who attended reported learning that there are some new laws regarding rental properties:if police are called to the same family's residence 3 times in a year, the landlord must evict them. If the landlord doesn't comply, the rental license will be revoked for 1 year.if police are called to the same family's residence 6 times in a year, the landlord is fined.if police are injured on a call, the landlord is responsible for their medical costs.We don't intend to challenge the laws at this time - they make it easier for us to evict problem tenants whose visitors damage our property, assuming we get timely notification of the calls - but were wondering if there are examples of similar laws that have either gone unchallenged for a long period of time or that have been challenged and judged to be legal.New info:The laws were reportedly based on those of Norristown, Pennsylvania. There's a post from the ACLU , which states in part:Under a local ordinance, three calls to the police in four months,including for protection from crimes such as domestic violence, would result in revocation of the landlord's rental license and removal of the tenant for trespassing. A second version of the ordinance imposed steep fines on the landlord that could be avoided if the landlord evicted the tenant, even if she was in dire need of emergency or police assistance.Today, we reached a settlement with Norristown. Under the agreement, Norristown will pay $495,000 in compensation and attorneys' fees to Ms. Briggs. It also repealed its ordinance and promised not to pass another law that would punish residents and landlords as a result of requests for emergency assistance.(I suppose the preceding quote answers my question.)","answer":"Those who attended reported learning that there are some new laws regarding rental properties [...] they make it easier for us to evict problem tenants whose visitors damage our propertyThese &quot;laws&quot; as described (and with no verifiable references) sound incredibly inept, contravening public policy of any state, and very likely to expose credulous landlords to liability for wrongful eviction. Meetings for landlords ought to be much more reliable than this.For instance, suppose a tenant has needed police assistance twice in the residential unit in a year, and now he is the victim of another crime therein. It makes no sense to require eviction on grounds that that is the third time the &quot;police are called to the same family's residence 3 times in a year&quot; to protect the victim-tenant.Nor is there a scintilla of proportionality in these alleged laws. Someone's loud music in the residential unit is definitely less of a concern than a shooting in progress, yet these &quot;new laws&quot; as described here seem to treat both types of scenarios equally.Minor issues involving the police might not even get notified to the landlord. Accordingly, the &quot;new laws&quot; imply that a landlord would never know whether he is on the brink of having his license revoked.Making landlords liable for medical costs from injuries to police agents is another misguided principle. Criminality in a town or urban area is something beyond landlords' control.The residential unit might be vacant (example: because the landlord evicted the former tenants as per these &quot;new laws&quot;) and still be the scene of arson. It is absurd to make penalizations contingent on whether the landlord was even able to evict someone at that point.The matter would trigger fair housing issues as well as public policy considerations regarding the supply and demand of residential units."}
{"question":"In South Africa the term fair\/unfair discrimination is often used to illustrate between lawful and unlawful discrimination. I get annoyed when they have the anti racism campaigns in English football when they say that society has to eradicate all forms of discrimination. I think they may mean all forms of unfair discrimination but it still seems ignorant to what discrimination really means.There was a landmark case in the Western Cape where a rich wine farm was left in a will to the land owner's nephews. The land owner's 5 daughters sought to have the will deemed invalid because the daughters believed it was discriminated based on gender, because right or wrongly the land owner believed farming was a man's job.After years of litigation the SA courts said that although the sister was indeed discriminated against that it does not invalidate a will. People are free to leave their possession in a will in accordance with any reason they may choose. In effect deeming it fair discrimination. Also noting an inheritance is a gift and nobody has a right to it.So in closing, I would like to know if the US system has a similar concept of fair and unfair discrimination. If they even use those words. After all you discriminate against Pepsi everytime you buy Coke.","answer":"The closest that you can come is as exemplified , where the agency states the generalization thatThe laws enforced by EEOC makes it unlawful for Federal agencies todiscriminate against employees and job applicants on the bases ofrace, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or age.Anti-discrimination laws always state a sphere of prohibition (employment, housing, etc.) and a basis (race, religion, age etc.). There are also multiple jurisdictions, for example there are federal laws, state laws, and even municipal laws. It may then be legal to discriminate on one basis at the federal level but prohibited at the city level. (This is because the federal government has a specific domain where it can set the rules and cities can have a different smaller domain). The concept of &quot;fair discrimination&quot; as opposed to &quot;unfair discrimination&quot; does not exist under US law, instead it reduces to &quot;illegal discrimination&quot; versus &quot;everything else&quot;. Liking \/ not liking Pepsi\/Coke or Chinese vs. Mexican food is not regulated by law in the US."}
{"question":"I know treason charges, in and of themselves, seems rarely pursued, in part because of its strict definition. However, I was interested in this restriction:No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.Obviously, this was written in the late 1700s, with concerns of something like a 'Star Chamber' being formed. However, we now have cameras and electronic records; non-witness means of verifying behavior. I was wondering if treason charges would be able to be brought in the following scenarios:A physical act of treason, captured on video recordingAn electronic act of treason, captured in an electronic record","answer":"Thus being a fundamental question of constitutional law, this translates into asking how SCOTUS would likely rule given a certain situation where e.g. there was no confession and the two-witness requirement is not satisfied. In the case of , 325 U.S. 1, the direct testimony of two or more witnesses established that 'Cramer met Thiel and Kerling on the occasions and at the places charged; that they drank together, and that they engaged long and earnestly in conversation', but 'There was no proof by two witnesses of what they said, or in what language they conversed; no showing that Cramer gave them any information whatever of value to their mission, or that he had any to give; no showing of any effort at secrecy, they having met in public places, and no evidence that Cramer furnished them shelter, sustenance, or supplies, or that he gave them encouragement or counsel, or even paid for their drinks'. The ruling (in favor of the defendant) focused on the fact that what was suffiently witnessed was not treasonous (drinks and conversation are not overt acts of treason). The court assigns some significance to the testimony of a single witness Kopp, stating that  To the extent that his conviction rests upon such evidence, and it  does to an unknown but considerable extent, it rests upon the  uncorroborated testimony of one witness not without strong emotional  interest in the drama of which Cramer's trial was a part.The fact that the evidence was uncorroborated is dispositive in this case.There has not been a case where a conviction was supported only by circumstantial evidence, and the language of the Constitution plus the meaning of 'testimony of a witness' is clear enough that it would be a major break with legal tradition to say that circumstantial evidence can substitute for direct evidence (testimony). A video recording cannot testify, only a person can testify. A person can testify that they watched a video, but they cannot testify that they directly witnessed defendant making a certain statement. Rather they can testify that they inferred from watching the video that defendant made a statement. This is not to say that some SCOTUS could not find a path for conviction based on circumstantial evidence, but that would be a significant break from existing tradition."}
{"question":"Suppose that someone is a victim of police misconduct and the officer who was on duty at the time is eventually found guilty of police misconduct. Usually the victim walks out with award money (lawsuit or from suing an officer). Let's say the crime the officer committed was a felony or the victim isn't satisfied with the amount of money offered to them. Can they request that the alleged officer receive a (hefty) prison sentence rather than being awarded money of some kind? (Referring to U.S.)","answer":"For a police officer, there's a usually a difference between 'misconduct' and 'committing a crime', and another difference between 'committing a crime' and 'committing a crime that gets you sent to jail'. If the misconduct was actually such that it was a crime that would be punished by jail time, and if there was good evidence for it, then I would assume that the police would investigate it and eventually arrest this officer, take him to court, convict him, and send him to jail. Whether the victim is satisfied with the money they received doesn't really matter. And nobody will send the police officer to jail because the victim demands it - the police officer will go to jail if a prosecutor thinks he should, and a judge or jury agrees. Independent of whether the victim demands it or not. "}
{"question":"It is frequently said that the current term limit for a US President is 10 years, consisting of inheriting the presidency for a 2 year caretaker term, then elected twice for 8 years, not necessarily consecutive.Here's a hypothetical question.  I do not expect it to happen ever, but would it be legal under current US laws?The President dies, and the VP takes over for slightly less than 2 years. In the next election,  he does not want to run again for President, but stands again for VP. He and his partner are elected. Then two years later the President resigns, and the VP is again elevated to nearly 2 years as  caretaker President. Repeat for a third term, nearly 2 years  as caretaker President. Then he decides to run for President himself, and gets elected twice. Thus he gets 14 years as President, total.This is extremely unlikely to happen, but is it possible?","answer":"The relevant part of the 22nd amendment to the US constitution says:No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of President more than once.The question is dues &quot;more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President&quot; mean &quot;more than two years of any single term ...&quot; or &quot;more than two years of any and all such terms taken together&quot;. The former is closer to the plain meaning of the text, but the latter is almost surely what Congress intended, given the history of the 22nd. There is no case law, because there is no case in which a person has been elected VP and become president in two or more different terms. Indeed there is no case of a person who, having become president on the death or resignation of a president, then ran again as VP. There is no telling how a court would rule in such a situation, but I rather suspect that the 10-year limit interpretation would be upheld."}

Supposing that you are correct that the vehicle was operated by someone who hit and ran, then if the police gain suspicions that such is the case, and if those suspicions are reasonable, then then could obtain a warrant to obtain evidence from the vehicle, which could be used against the operator. The fact that you (might) now own the vehicle would not transfer legal responsibility to you \u2013 responsibbility goes with the actor, not the instrument."}
{"question":"As I understand it assault can include the implied threat of using physical force against an individual, such as looming over someone, to compel them to do something.  I believe many US states also have related laws about harassment, menacing, etc.However, the job of security personnel seems to be primarily to discourage activities by being present as deterrent against such crimes.  Their mere presence is not a threat or assault of course, but if they are attempting to deter someone from acting in negative manner the security personnel would likely have to get close to the person and make demands that they leave or stop whatever activity their engaged in in a manner that could be considered a threat of force if they don't comply.To go with a particular difficult example think of a bouncer at a bar.  More then most security personnel a bouncers job is practically defined by their ability to loom.  My father owned a bar, and as he described it to me a good bouncer should be identifying someone who's likely to cause an incident and basically pre-emptively start looming nearby them to remind the inebriated fellow that the bouncer is ready to use physical force if necessary in hopes of preventing a situation from occurring.  Likewise breaking up a minor fight often involves a good amount of getting between the two fighting and looking menacing enough that no one want's to try to go around you.  Basically you want your bouncer to be able to menace people when a situation is escalating because it's a far safer way of preventing the escalation then allowing it to degreed to violence.Is a bouncer, or other security individual, guilty of assault or related crime when they do something like this?  Does the fact that they are employed by a business with the explicit task of keeping the peace give them any extra leeway with such actions?  Is the fact that they are trying to prevent\/discourage other crimes give them more leeway?","answer":"Is a bouncer, or other security individual, guilty of assult or related crime when they do something like this?Maybe.Being a bouncer or security officer (or police officer) does not give you the right to break the law- the law applies to you as it does to everyone else.In many jurisdictions assault is a crime defined by statute, however, we'll use the common law definition &quot;an attempt to initiate harmful or offensive contact with a person, or a threat to do so.&quot;Implicit in this is that the &quot;harmful or offensive contact&quot; is unlawful. There are many situations where you may make contact with someone without it being unlawful.

{"question":"Imagine a person accused of committing a crime hires a lawyer. After a while something happens and the lawyer decides he or she doesn't want to represent the client any more.For example:Ethical reasons: When they were hired the lawyer thought the client was innocent (e. g. he thinks the wife accuses the husband of rape just to piss him off), but in the course of the process they came to the conclusion the client is guilty (e. g. the husband actually raped his wife). Defending an innocent client was OK with the moral standars of the lawyer, defending a criminal, who committed a particularly nasty (according to the beliefs of the lawyer) crime isn't.Client doesn't pay: The client, whether innocent or not, runs out of money and can't pay the lawyer any more.Is it legal for the lawyer to stop defending his client?Notes:I'm only interested if it's legal. I understand that if a lawyer steps down from a lawsuit, it may ruin his reputation (other clients may fear they will do the same during their trials).If the answer to this question depends on the state, then I'm interested in a criminal lawsuit in Arkansas.In the section ethical reasons I mean a situation, when the lawyer has the gut feeling that the client is 100 % guilty, but the court may think otherwise. In real life there are situations, when you have a feeling like that, but you can't prove it. Nonetheless, you act based on that feeling (even if there is no evidence that could prove this feeling to another party). The evidence may be not enough for court or police, but it's enough for them.","answer":"Ethical reasonsA lawyer absolutely cannot stop defending a client because the lawyer believes the client is guilty.  This is so that an apparently guilty client only has to convince a court of his innocence, not a court and his lawyer.This is however a complicated area.  The lawyer is an officer of the court, and is not allowed to lie to the court, or to allow his client to lie to the court; if the client says 'I done it' to the lawyer, the lawyer may demand that the prosecution provides strict proof of all their evidence - but he can't put his client in the witness box.  If the client wants to go in the witness box, then the lawyer may withdraw: but on the grounds that he has irreconcilable differences on how to defend the case.Client stops payingI don't know, but I believe this is a valid reason for a lawyer to withdraw."}
{"question":"I recorded a polling call and forgot to ask the person if it was OK to do so.Massachusetts, where the company is located, has a two party consent law for recording.New Jersey is one party consent.So what the law when the person making the phone call is in Massachusetts, and the recorder\/recipient is in New Jersey?","answer":"It depends. On what? On how a judge feels on a given day.  That is to say, we are not sure.  Conventional wisdom says that we should be cautious and assume that the law of the stricter state will apply. But  argue that the law of the state where the recording device is located should apply.I found this discussion to be the most complete one-stop place for a nice summary. . I'm going to paste it here because I can and because SE likes that.    Interstate phone calls   Date:  August 1, 2012   In light of the  differing state laws governing electronic recording of conversations  between private parties, journalists are advised to err on the side of  caution when recording or disclosing an interstate telephone call. The  safest strategy is to assume that the stricter state law will apply.  For example, a reporter located in the District of Columbia who  records a telephone conversation without the consent of a party  located in Maryland would not violate District of Columbia law, but  could be liable under Maryland law. A court located in the District of  Columbia may apply Maryland law, depending on its conflict of laws  rules. Therefore, an aggrieved party may choose to file suit in either  jurisdiction, depending on which law is more favorable to the party's  claim.   In one case, a New York trial court was asked to apply the  Pennsylvania wiretap law  which requires consent of all parties  to  a call placed by a prostitute in Pennsylvania to a man in New York.  Unlike the Pennsylvania wiretap statute, the New York and federal  statutes require the consent of only one party. The call was recorded  with the woman's consent by reporters for The Globe, a national  tabloid newspaper. The court ruled that the law of the state where the  injury occurred, New York, should apply. (Krauss v. Globe  International)   The Supreme Court of California in Kearney v. Salomon  Smith Barney applied California wiretap law to a company located in  Georgia that routinely recorded business phone calls with its clients  in California. California law requires all party consent to record any  telephone calls, while Georgia law requires only one party consent.  The state's high court, applying choice of law principles, reasoned  that the failure to apply California law would impair California's  interest in protecting the degree of privacy afforded to California  residents by California law more severely than the application of  California law would impair any interests of the State of Georgia.  In another case involving Pennsylvania law, four employees of The  Times Leader, a newspaper in Wilkes-Barre, were arrested after they  printed a transcript of a telephone conversation between a columnist  in Pennsylvania and a murder suspect living in Virginia that was  recorded without the suspect's permission. The Virginia and federal  statutes allow one party to record a conversation, while Pennsylvania,  as discussed above, requires the consent of all parties. The man asked  prosecutors to charge the journalists under the Pennsylvania law. The  court eventually dismissed the charges against the newspaper staff   but on the unrelated ground that the suspect had no expectation of  privacy during his telephone interview with the columnist.  (Pennsylvania v. Duncan)   Federal law may apply when the conversation  is between parties who are in different states, although it is  unsettled whether a court will hold in a given case that federal law  pre-empts state law. In Duncan, the newspaper argued that the  federal law should pre-empt the state statutes, because the telephone  call crossed state lines, placing it under federal jurisdiction.  However, in that case, the court did not address the pre-emption  issue. Moreover, as noted above, either state may choose to enforce  its own laws."}

{"question":"I've tried googling this, but I'm not sure how to phrase it in a way that would catch the right legal terms.As I understand it, in some states in the US, a minor (i.e. younger than 18) who is at least 16 years old, can petition the state for emancipation; i.e. legal separation from their parents, and allowed to enter the world as a legal adult, despite being younger than 18.However, in order to be granted this, the minor must prove that they are capable of supporting themselves financially, that they have somewhere to live, and a few other things.My question is about the degree to which an unrelated adult could assist the minor in satisfying these requirements, in order to achieve emancipation. Obviously, the adult could adopt the minor. But, if either party did not want to go with full adoption, could the adult \"sponsor\" the minor in some way that would satisfy the legal requirements. So, the minor is still an independent legal adult, but has a guaranteed support network just in case.For example, could the adult sign a contract sponsoring the minor until the age of 18; guaranteeing the minor room & board in the adult's home, and\/or will financially subsidize the minor's income up to a certain level if they wish to live on their own, etc.Is there a mechanism like this, or is this a custom situation that a judge might approve? or is something like this totally off the table?","answer":"<h3>What is emancipation of a minor?<\/h3>As I understand it, in some states in the US, a minor (i.e. youngerthan 18) who is at least 16 years old, can petition the state foremancipation; i.e. legal separation from their parents, and allowed toenter the world as a legal adult, despite being younger than 18.However, in order to be granted this, the minor must prove that theyare capable of supporting themselves financially, that they havesomewhere to live, and a few other things.This is true in some places, but not others.There are two different concepts for emancipation under U.S. law, and most states follow one or the other.One concept is that emancipation is a factual reality that exists when a minor is self-supporting or supported by a spouse or significant other, and not living in the household of a parent. In states that follow this concept, such as Colorado, a court ruling that a minor is emancipated is simply a finding of fact about what is, rather than a grant of permission.Another concept is that a minor is, as a matter of law, not emancipated until a court grants minor permission to deviate from the status implied by their age. My understanding that this is the concept used in California.In these jurisdictions, emancipation is granted only after an good faith attempt to give notice to the parents and a hearing, and involves an assessment of the capacity of the minor to be self-supporting without parental assistance and involvement. The question is focused on this concept, but it is not the only one and it is probably a close call as to which approach is the majority rule in U.S. states.Even in &quot;permission&quot; states, however, entering military service or marriage usually results in emancipation as a matter of law without any formal court proceeding.<h3>Common fact patterns<\/h3>There are certainly cases in which the fact that a minor is married or living in the household of a significant other as a stay at home parent would establish emancipation.Another fairly common fact pattern would be a employee whose employer also provides housing.Another fairly common fact pattern is a situation in which the whereabouts of the minor's parents are unknown and the minor has, somehow, been managing. Sometimes you see this when a minor's parents die and the minor goes on in an isolated wilderness area, for example.<h3>Adoption is indeed not an option<\/h3>Adoption is not possible without a termination of the rights of the parents (or at least one of them in the case of a stepparent adoption).<h3>The legal guardianship option<\/h3>The preferred arrangement when living basically as a child in a supportive adult's household would usually be a guardianship, to the detriment of the parent's role in most decision-making for the minor, rather than emancipation. Here are some quotes from  (In re Interest of A.D., 2023 COA 6 (January 19, 2023)), with that fact pattern:? 2 L.D. is the sole living parent of A.D., one of her three children.A.D. was sixteen at the time of the guardianship proceeding. AlthoughL.D. and A.D. once shared a healthy relationship, it deteriorateddramatically during the summer and fall of 2021. This deteriorationgave rise to Petitioners' request for  and the district court's grantof  an unlimited guardianship over A.D. We turn to that history now.? 3 In June 2021, A.D.'s car was vandalized while parked in front ofthe family home. A.D. and his mother had a heated argument about whyit happened and who was responsible for cleaning it. Upset by thisconversation, A.D. went to stay at his girlfriend's house. Although hesoon returned home, A.D. ran away from home five more times followingdisagreements with L.D.? 4 In early July 2021, L.D. gave A.D. an ultimatum: he could (1) goto military school, (2) attend therapeutic boarding school, or (3)abide by her house rules. A.D. ran away again that night, but this 2time he spent over a month away from home, staying with hisgirlfriend, couch surfing at friends' homes, or sleeping in publicparks.? 5 On August 7, 2021, A.D. was taken to the emergency room afterappearing to overdose while partying with friends at a park. Thehospital made a mandatory report to the Department of Human Services(DHS). Once A.D. was stable, L.D. and V.T. (L.D.'s longtime colleagueand family friend) met with a DHS representative to discuss nextsteps. L.D. agreed that, given the hostility between A.D. and herself,and between A.D. and his two siblings (who both lived with L.D.), itwas in his best interest to stay with Petitioners.? 6 On September 8, 2021, A.D. drove Petitioners' car to L.D.'s housefor his first night back since early July. When he arrived, L.D.became extremely upset that he had driven there. In her mind, A.D.'soperation of a car  and Petitioners' facilitation of it  violatedtheir agreement that he not drive until certain conditions were met.The next morning, without notice to Petitioners or her son, L.D.called the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and withdrew herpermission for A.D.'s driver's license. The DMV revoked his licensethe next day.? 7 A.D. became enraged when he learned that his mother had revokedher consent and subsequently sent a series of angry texts to her. L.D.then blocked A.D.'s number, thus preventing A.D.'s calls or texts fromcoming through to L.D.'s phone (though texts came through on hercomputer).? 8 On September 24, 2021, DHS facilitated an adults only meetingwith L.D., Petitioners, and DHS representatives. That meeting resultedin three shared priorities: (1) Petitioners were to provide regularupdates about A.D. to L.D., who would, in turn, communicate withPetitioners before making decisions affecting A.D.; (2) A.D.'s licensewould be reauthorized within thirty days once to-be-defined conditionswere met; and (3) A.D. would be allowed to be on the high schoolwrestling team, which all parties agreed was good for him.? 9 Over the next month, Petitioners regularly emailed L.D. updates onA.D. L.D. provided few, if any, responses to these updates.Petitioners also sent L.D. a proposed plan for A.D. to get his licenseback, but L.D. did not respond.? 10 On October 20, 2021, Petitioners filed their petition forappointment as A.D.'s guardians. L.D. objected to the petition, soughtdismissal of the action, and requested attorney fees.? 11 On November 8, 2021, Petitioners requested that the court appointa guardian ad litem (GAL) to represent A.D.'s interests. Over L.D.'sobjection, the court appointed a GAL pursuant to section 15-14-115,C.R.S. 2022, after concluding that, owing to their disagreement overthe guardianship, the parties could not represent A.D.'s best interestin the guardianship proceedings. The GAL represented A.D.'s bestinterest throughout the litigation, and the court also instructed theGAL to provide a report about whether L.D. was unable to exercise herparental rights.? 12 On November 14, 2021, before Petitioners filed their reply, L.D. without consulting Petitioners or A.D.  revoked her permission forA.D. to wrestle the day before the first day of practice. Why she tookthis sudden action is unclear: L.D. testified it was because A.D. wasnot maintaining passing grades, while another witness testified thatshe wanted leverage over him to participate in family therapy.Regardless, A.D. was devastated by the timing and nature of thisaction.? 13 While these motions were pending, Petitioners continued to carefor A.D. Petitioners asked L.D. for permission to talk to A.D.'steachers, coaches, and doctors about how to better care for him. Yetfrom August to early December 2021, L.D. refused to grant Petitionerspermission to engage with these individuals. She ignored or outrightrefused to allow such communications until December 8, 2021, when,after repeated requests from a DHS representative, she allowedPetitioners to attend  but not participate in  a meeting with A.D.'steachers.? 14 L.D. also resisted Petitioners' requests for financial supportfor A.D.'s care. To her credit, L.D. provided A.D. with $25 per weekfor groceries. These funds came from A.D.'s $1,800 monthlysurvivorship benefit, which was established following the death ofA.D.'s father when A.D. was three. Petitioners knew the benefitexisted and requested more financial support. L.D. did not respond tothese requests.? 15 Except for the text exchange between L.D. and A.D. following therevocation of L.D.'s consent for A.D.'s license, L.D. and A.D. nevercommunicated directly. Instead, all such communications went throughPetitioners or DHS.? 16 Consistent with section 15-14-205(1), C.R.S. 2022, the districtcourt conducted a hearing on Petitioners' guardianship motion. Thehearing spanned two days, with both sides calling numerous witnesses.? 17 In a written order, the court granted Petitioners an unlimitedguardianship over A.D. In so doing, the court concluded thatPetitioners had proved by clear and convincing evidence that L.D. was,consistent with section 15-14-204(2)(c), unwilling or unable to carefor A.D. and that the guardianship was in A.D.'s best interestnotwithstanding his mother's opposition to it.The linked appellate court decision then goes on to conduct legal analysis and affirms the trial court's ruling as correct. The official syllabus of the case summarizes that part of the opinion as follows:A division of the court of appeals reviews the guardianshipappointment for a minor under section 15-14-204(2)(c), C.R.S.2022. In so doing, the division adopts the analytical framework outlined in , 242 P.3d1128 (Colo. 2010). Applying that framework to section 15-14-204(2)(c), the division concludes that the moving party must prove, byclear and convincing evidence, that the parent is (1) unable orunwilling to exercise their parental rights, and (2) the guardianshipis in the best interest of the minor notwithstanding the parent(s)'opposition to the guardianship. Moreover, in entering such an order,the court must articulate the special factors it relies upon to justify this interference with parental rights. SeeTroxel v. Granville,  (2000).Utilizing that frameworkhere, the division concludes that the court did not err in appointinga guardian for the minor."}

It extends to every  offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its  commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their  pendency, or after conviction and judgment. The power is not subject  to legislative control.Accordingly, presidents have written pardons on and with numerous different writing instruments. Insofar as there are no constitutional restrictions beyond the aforementioned, it is not required that a pardon be signed, or that it be on a tangible semi-permanent medium. It is impossible to know what such a pardon tweet would look like, beyond the limit on length.The one place where a presidential signature is required is under the Presentment Clause, that when presented with a bill that passed the two houses of Congress, 'If he approve he shall sign it'.

{"question":"Why does boxing (and perhaps MMA) need to be sanctioned by state authorities like the ? Other sports like baseball require no such state license, nor does a contact sport like football or even a sport that includes actual physical fighting like hockey. Why isn't engaging in a boxing match a form of protected free speech that the state cannot obstruct?","answer":"Boxing doesn't have to be regulated by a government agency, but it generally is regulated in this way (1) because states are concerned about regulating fighting with an intent to do physical harm to the other player (which is strictly speaking against the rules even in contact sports like hockey), which would otherwise violate criminal laws unless there was a statutory exception, and (2) because they want to regulate gambling associated with the events (which, again, they wouldn't have to do, but in practice, all states completely ban gambling subject to specific regulated gambling systems, or de minimis exceptions).Historically, many boxing &quot;leagues&quot; were corrupt and manipulated both to punish people disliked by organized crime by forcing people to participate to cleanse what would otherwise be illegal gang vigilante activities and to cheat people betting on matches by fixing the results of fights. Dueling was also historically a major social problem among the political and economic elites in parts of the country.States have the power to ban boxing, football, wrestling, judo, lacrosse, hockey, rugby, fencing, and any other contract sport if they wish to do so, under the U.S. Constitution. States allow contact sports because they choose to do so as a matter of policy, not because the right to engage in contact sports is protected by the First Amendment.There is a constitutional right to have sex with other consenting adults under the U.S. Supreme Court's Lawrence v. Texas,  (2003) decision (which is not based primarily on the First Amendment right to free speech), but there is no constitutional right for consenting adults to authorize physical harm to each other in an agreed form of combat.Free speech does not protect contract sports such as boxing because the protected conduct does not primarily exist to communicate ideas, and also because the state has a compelling state interest in preventing people from physically harming each other that goes back to the oldest political theory justifications for the existence of the state in the first place by scholars such as Locke and Hobbes."}

The  for relaying such information to GSA don't indicate that there's any kind of meaningful restrictions on how vendors handle the data they submit.I suspect this is a reflection of the idea that there's no real point forcing businesses to spend more money protecting their own information than they think is cost-efficient. A hospital or credit-card company with lax security endangers the private information of thousands or millions of customers who expect privacy, but a vendor who fails to secure his inventory data generally risks exposing only his own information, which may not even be secret in the first place.

From the perspective of US law, it is perfectly legal to buy an India-only copy in India, then re-sell it in the US. For all you know, somebody brought a copy with them to the US and did just that. The reseller (presumably) has no contractual relation with the publisher, and even if they did, you can't sue the reseller for breach of the India-only contract with the publisher. The only party that has legal recourse based on the &quot;India sale only&quot; restriction is the publisher.

Some people have asserted that there is a constitutional duty imposed by the phrase &quot;advise and consent&quot; but that view has never commanded significant support, nor has any court that I know of included such a view in a decision. In general, US courts would consider this a political question and would dismiss any case that attempted to compel the Senate to consider such a matter.The only way to impose such a duty on the Senate would be through a constitutional amendment. For example, an amendment could provide that if a nomination is not voted on by the senate within 180 days, it will be deemed approved and the nominee confirmed.

The best way to find out about those will be to write or call the brokerage. They will probably need proof of identity. There may be tax implications, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where deceased was domiciled, or where the beneficiary now is. The brokerage may handle that, or some of it, but the beneficiary would be wise to consult a tax expert or lawyer if the sum is sizable."}
{"question":"Considering US law (federal, state and local), are there any laws which fall outside of the following categories (pulled from Wikipedia)?Criminal Law Tort Law  Contract LawProperty Law  Constitutional and Administrative Law  International LawAs I am not versed in law, it may be that the term 'law' itself is ambiguous or perhaps I have not been precise or accurate in the naming of these categories.For instance, I'm not sure if military law is properly included as a subset of the bodies I've listed or if it is maintained as separate within our legal institutions.The long and short of the question intends whether there are any actions (including the null action -- inaction) that can be committed by a person (human or corporate) that, under the jurisdiction of the US, can fall afoul of the law and can't be incorporated into one of the above categories.To say 'no' would mean than any action (if that term is not itself legally ambiguous) that contravenes the law, criminal or civil, would fall into one of these categories. I suppose it may also be incoherent to consider law merely as a collection of impositions or prohibitions of 'actions'.","answer":"YesProbate law, consumer protection law and family law spring to mind."}
{"question":"Let's say I give someone a bitcoin and then they give me a phone. Could the IRS  or a similar organization, if outside the U.S.  say I bougth the phone and take a chunk of the bitcoins? What if they set up an inventory of phones, and gave a phone to whomever gave him a bitcoin? Would the IRS get involved?","answer":"The United State doesn't have a national sales or value added tax, so the IRS would only care about the phone sale insofar as it might represent income to the seller. Insofar as it's income to the seller, it doesn't matter whether the transaction is cash, bitcoin or barter, the seller is supposed to account for it in their income taxes. If you are suggesting that bitcoin sales could be hidden, well, folks have been hiding cash transactions since taxes were invented. Worst case, the IRS discovers that the seller's spending is wildly out of line with their stated income and they begin a criminal investigation."}

{"question":"Once something like a meme goes viral and is widely used by people, itcannot legally function as a trademark, he said. It will typicallytake the office around four months to deliver a decision on theapplications, Mr. Gerben said, but a pending application should notstop a company from beginning work.Let's say we use the name \"Ok Boomer Trading Company\". Since we can't trademark a meme, we can't sue other people for using a similar name, but can we be sued by someone for using a meme, which is public domain? I am wondering if we can be sued outside of trademark or copyright reasons for using a meme in the naming of a company or product since it may cause confusion of sort or because we're using something that is in the public domain, which may hurt the public interest in some way.","answer":"A phrase which is too generic or in too wide currnt use to be a valid trademark, may nevertheless be used as a business name or slogan.For example &quot;Good Pizza&quot; is so generic that I am reasonably sure that it  could not be registered as a trademark, but a business could use that as a name or slogan. A business that did so would forgo any of the advantages of trademark protection or of having a clearly unique name, but as no one else owns trademark rights to the phrase either, no one could sue such a business over its choice of name, or not with any hope of success.Similarly, if a phrase taken from a meme cannot be registered, no one else can have it as a trademark, and so no one can sue successfully.As to copyright, names, titles, and short phrases are simply not protectable by copyright at all. See the US Copyright office circular 01 &quot;Copyright Basics&quot; which says on page 2;Copyright does not protect ... Titles, names, short phrases, and slogansCircular 33 &quot;Works Not Protected by Copyright&quot;  says on pages 2-3:Names, Titles, Short PhrasesWords and short phrases, such as names, titles, and slogans, are uncopyrightable because they contain an insufficient amount of authorship. The Office will not register individual words or brief combinations of words, even if the word or short phrase is novel, distinctive, or lends itself to a play on words.Examples of names, titles, or short phrases that do not contain a sufficient amount of creativityto support a claim in copyright include:The name of an individual (including pseudonyms, pen names, or stage names)The title or subtitle of a work, such as a book, a song, or a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural workThe name of a business or organizationThe name of a band or performing groupThe name of a product or serviceA domain name or URLThe name of a characterCatchwords or catchphrasesMottos, slogans, or other short expressionsAs for... if we can be sued outside of trademark or copyright reasonsTrademark and copyright are basically the only kinds of suit likely to be brought over a business name, logo or similar identification, particularly in the fact patter discussed in the question. (However, see the section on &quot;fraud&quot; below.) Things that are in the public domain are free for anyone to use, not protected against anyone's use. What is not permitted is trying to claim an exclusive right to PD items., by a copyright or trademark claim.The one exception I can think of is that if someone had established a phrase as a trademark, and it later became a meme, then perhaps the trademark owner could sue over uses of it. But with the phrase having become generic, it might well lose any trademark protection.The first thing a plaintiff must do in presenting a trademark suit is establish that the mark is a currently valid trademark, owned by the plaintiff. If the mark is not a valid tm, the suit is over because it has no protection.FraudA comment states:...  Intentionally misleading others to believe you are a particular party using a non-protectable name, when in fact you are a different party, seems like fraud, and it very much hinges on the name\/similar identification.In the fact patter from this comment, the name is derived from a meme, and so there is no other particular person. In that case one cannot plausibly be deceiving anyone into thinking that a business is actually a different business, because there is no business which is uniquely identified by the name.Still, it is possible for fraud to occur in a fact pattern similar to this. Say a local store calls itself &quot;good pizza&quot;, a name not protect able as a trademark, because it is too generic.  But it is popular and has a good reputation. Another store, hoping to confuse customers, calls itself &quot;Goode Pizza&quot;. A customer calls &quot;Goode Pizza&quot; and aks &quot;Are you the Good Pizza on George Street?&quot; (which is the location of the first store. An employee answers &quot;Yes&quot; (falsely) and the customer then places a delivery order. That might be fraud.For a fraud case, in most jurisdictions, it must be proved that:A person knowingly made a false statement (or in some jurisdictions an intentionally misleading statement&quot;);with the intention of getting a financial advantage, or depriving another of an advantage or benefit;The statement was material to  the transaction (meaning that the other party might well have not agreed to the transaction, or demanded different terms, in the absence of the fraudulent statement);The other party relied on the fraudulent statement;it was reasonable for the other party to rely on the fraudulent statement; andharm was done to the other party as a result of this reliance.Some jurisdictions omit or modify some of these elements.In the Good Pizza \/ Goode Pizza scenario above, ther is a knowingly false statement. Since the customer asked about the identity of the store, it can be assumed that it was material to the transaction. The imitation of the other store's name suggests an intention to mislead, although more proof might be needed. There was reliance, and it was probably reasonable.  What is not clear is the harm done -- additional evidence might be needed on that element. This scenario is, however, rather different from the situation discussed in the question.Note that in the US, trademarks can be protected from mere use, without registration, if they otherwise qualify. In general there will be a preference to frame such a case as one of trademark infringement, rather than fraud, if possible, because fraud is usually harder to prove (trademark infringement  dose notr require proof of intention to mislead nor of knowing falsehood), and statutory damages may be available in a trademark infringement case, without any need to prove actual damages. Also, the competing store would generally not be able to bring a fraud case, only the customer who was mislead. could do so"}
{"question":"I am a u.s citizen. I got married(We had a wedding with witness) and lived with my ex-wife who's non-u.s citizen for 7 years without registering our marriage in any country. We've never lived in the U.S together and she's not a GC holder. We are now separate. Can she sue me for bigamy if I married someone else later? And how can she do that outside of America? What happens if she reported this to the U.S embassy in her country? Our marriage is not legal under the laws of neither the place we got married in nor the place that we live now. We didn't register our marriage anywhere in the world. But we had a wedding, a ton of photos and witness who are friends and families.","answer":"Informal , you might be. There are three relevant elements to legal marriages at least in the US: a solemnization (ceremony), a license (or document like the Declaration of Informal Marriage document signed in Texas), and filing the license. You claim that the marriage is not legal in the place you got married or where you are now, but that conclusion might be wrong (I assume that opinion is based on your understanding of local laws, but that understanding might be in error. If your lawyer told you so, then I don't know why you're asking here, so I assume you didn't ask a lawyer). The main issue of concern would be over whether that country requires a license of registration for a marriage to be valid, or does a church ceremony along suffice. Unregistered marriages are not legally recognized in Kenya, so it could matter what country this happened in.Assuming that you did not cross the threshold for 'common law marriage' wherever you were when you 'got married', then you are not married now. As pointed out by ohwilleke, an issue could arise if you visited one of the 10 US states that recognizes common law marriage, and accidentally satisfied the requirements for a common law marriage (without ceremony). Texas would not be a problem even if you were there and introduced yourselves as man and wife, because there is also a cohabitation requirement (: 'the man and woman agreed to be married and after the agreement they lived together in this state as husband and wife and there represented to others that they were married'), but such a requirement might not exist in all states.Assuming also that you are currently in the US (hence subject to jurisdiction of some state), it is pretty much guaranteed that you have not committed bigamy. Bigamy laws can differ somewhat from state to state, but picking the  as an example, one would have committed bigamy if one 'intentionally marries or purports to marry another person when either person has a living spouse'. However one can defend oneself against that charge if 'the actor reasonably believed that he or she was legally eligible to marry'. I cannot find a statutory definition of 'spouse' in the relevant chapter of RCW, in which case the term takes its ordinary meaning (which means there considerable wiggle room if the matter hasn't been decided by some court). At any rate, bigamy charges in Washington are extremely unlikely.If your 'ex' lived in a country which has a very expansive definition of bigamy (presumably by having a very expansive definition of marriage), then you might be subject to charges if you were ever in that country. But you could not be extradited from the US to that country for prosecution. "}
{"question":"I'm very much a layman, and an Englishman rather than American, with an interest in political philosophy. I was reading through the US constitution the other day, and one sentence in Article I, Section 9 stood out to me:No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.With respect to ex post facto laws in particular, this made me wonder about the legality of the Nuremberg Trials. One of the key points made by the defendants at Nuremberg was that their transgressions - the mass killings, the conspiracies to wage wars of conquest, etc - were not crimes under German law at the time they were committed.The Nuremberg trials represented an uncomfortable fusion of American, British and Soviet law. To the best of my knowledge, there is no straightforward ban on ex post facto legislation within British law, although there is a vague consensus that such laws are unjust and are to be avoided. Whatever the articles contained within it, the Soviets in this period only seemed to treat their constitution as a set of guidelines and aspirations. But it strikes me as odd that the Americans would be willing to overlook such a clear ban, since they, more than any other nation, have tended to view their constitution as a kind of sacred text.I anticipate that one response to my question will be that the US constitution applies to domestic matters, and not to international law. This seems correct at first glance, until we read in Article I, Section 8 that one of the powers of Congress granted by the constitution is 'To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations'. But I'm sure that there are many layers of subtlety that I'm failing to grasp here, and I'd be grateful to anyone who could put me straight.I think I should close with the disclaimer that, in calling into question the legality of the Nuremberg trials, I don't intend to exonerate any of those who were convicted. They were certainly criminals in the moral sense of the word, and, putting questions of legality to one side, the world was better off without them in it.Regarding the matter of whether this question is a duplicate, I'll quote one of the comments below:The linked question is relevant, but not a duplicate. It briefly mentions the question of whether the trials operated under ex post facto laws, but devotes more space to other purported issues. None of the current answers address this issue.

{"question":"I've reason to believe that someone might be planning to sue me (it's unclear). Last Sunday night I got a knock on my apartment door at around 9:30pm from a stranger who tried to talk me into opening it without saying who she was or why she was there. When I asked her who she was trying to see she mumbled something inaudible.I live in a secure building, so this has me alarmed. Ordinarily I would assume this was a partygoer who had the wrong unit number, or an inept attempt at some kind of fraud or home invasion. But I've heard that process servers try to surprise people with documents out of the blue. Is it typical for California process servers to go straight to ambush before trying more prosaic methods like simply calling the target on the phone to set up a meeting or showing up at the front desk at their workplace? If not, this is a safety issue I need to address with my building's security.For clarity, I am not trying to dodge service, nor do I have a strong reason to believe someone is trying to sue me. The only reason I am considering this possibility is that there was an accident, and one of the parties in that accident has not given any indication of planning to sue, but also isn't returning calls. So I am trying to learn whether it is typical for injury attorneys in California to ambush people with process before having given notice of planning to sue, and while actively dodging calls. If that is true, then this intrusion into my building is explicable and less worrisome. But if it is unusual for California attorneys to behave in this way, then it becomes more likely that this person was a stalker's accomplice.","answer":"  Is it typical for California process servers to go straight to ambush  before trying more prosaic methods like simply calling the target on  the phone to set up a meeting or showing up at the front desk at their  workplace?Process servers (everywhere) almost never call the target on the phone to set up a meeting. This is because process is only successfully served (subject to certain exceptions) if it is hand delivered to the 'target'. A phone call will frequently cause someone to evade service of process.  while an ordinary lawyer in any other state would simply have someone  meet me at my office,You are mistaken. This would be quite unusual in any state.  If not, this is a safety issue I need to address with my building's  security.A process server is not a threat to your safety in any way. If you suspect that someone is trying to serve you with process, the right thing to do is to allow them to contact you and deliver the papers to you, rather than evading them. If you know the law firm that is trying to sue you, you can contact them and arrange to accept service of process and waive the requirement that a process server hand deliver the papers. A process server will not harm you in any way. They will simply hand you paperwork.Ultimately, a process server will successfully serve you (either because the job is given to a sheriff's deputy or because a court authorizes substituted service, for example, on your doorman or by email). The harder it is for them to serve you, the more expensive it will be for that to get done and ultimately the costs will be passed on to you.Also, if you are present and the process server tries to hand deliver papers to you and you refuse to touch or accept the papers, you have still been legally served with process and judgment by default will enter against you if you do not respond by the deadline stated in the summons."}
{"question":"Assume my friend and I are both licensed and have insurance for our own cars, but we're (obviously) not listed under each others' insurance plans.Let's say one of us borrows the other one's car (with permission) and has an accident.Whose coverage is responsible at that point to satisfy the legally mandated insurance coverage?

Or maybe the other driver's insurance comes into play too, maybe because, who knows, insurance companies might think risky people are more likely to lend to risky people. ","answer":"  Let's say one of us borrows the other one's car (with permission) and  has an accident.    Whose coverage is responsible at that point to satisfy the legally  mandated insurance coverage?    I assume that's only coverage against damage to others (which should  go under liability insurance?) but if I'm wrong please correct me.There are different types of insurance that may be required:liability insurance - pays damage to others (usually including your own passengers) which you are responsible for. This is legally required almost everywhere (both in the USA, where this depends on the state, and elsewhere). Rules vary on the required minimum amount, and the exact coverage (e.g. whether lost wages are covered in case of injury).uninsured motorist coverage - pays damages you or others suffered, which are the responsibility of another driver who is not insured. This is mandatory in some states of the USA. In some other countries, these damages are covered by a public insurance or trust (such as the  in Germany).personal injury protection - pays your own medical costs, no matter who is at fault. Required in some states of the USA.  Is the lender's insurance supposed to cover it?This depends on the insurance policy, but in almost all cases the policy is for the vehicle (and often has to be, under the laws requiring insurance). So if yes, if you lend your car to someone else, your insurance will cover them. Note, however, that some insurance policies restrict your right to lend your car - read the fine print!There is one situation where your own policy may be relevant:If the damages exceed the limit of the vehicle's insurance policy, your own policy may pay the rest - again, this will depend on the policy.  If so, wouldn't this not make sense? Insurance companies look at your   driving history (&amp; risk) when they offer you a plan, and if the borrower  has a poor history, you've increased the company's risk without their  knowledge, right? It would seem to open insurance rates to abuse.Yes, exactly. That is why many (if not most) insurance policies place limits on lending your car. You may only be allowed to lend it to people over 21 years of age, or only to people who you have registered as car users with the insurance company.  Is the borrower's insurance supposed to cover it?  If so, wouldn't this not make sense?  Insurance companies charge you differently based on what and how many  vehicles you want covered, so wouldn't borrowing someone's Lamborghini   suddenly open your insurance company to a massive risk without their   knowledge again?No, the borrower's insurance does not usually apply.Making the borrower's insurance apply would be problematic because the risk is based on the vehicle (type), too.Also, the borrower may not have insurance (e.g. may not own a car). In particular, enforcing the mandatory liability insurance is easier in practice if it is per vehicle, because you can check the insurance at vehicle registration (which practically all countries already require). If the liability insurance were per driver, it would be difficult to prevent a person w\/o insurance to borrow a car (as in your example).Finally, sometimes after an accident there is a dispute about who was driving the car (especially with hit-and-run accidents), but there is usually clear evidence (collision damage) what vehicle was involved. If insurance applies to the vehicle, a dispute over who was driving will not interfere with the victim's restitution.Thanks to supercat for pointing this out."}

So sorry you got dragged into our mess.From my understanding, the law prohibits things like recording phone calls that originate in Maryland without their knowledge.  Similarly, you cannot tape conversations in secret unless in private places.  The basic rule is to ask.  Our cops use body cameras and will ask and will turn them off if recording is refused.  Usually, if such is the case, get a recording of the request to turn off the camera recorded, and then turn it off immediately.   Baltimore City does have a city wide surveillance system, but there are more practical reasons as to why you don't want to go into Baltimore City with a camera and let people know about it... or just going into Baltimore in general... we're currently the national leaders in homicide (Baltimore County is not Baltimore City, so that's fine.).I am not a lawyer, so it might be better to call a legal office and ask for advise as a consultation I'm not sure of any specific practices.  Also keep in mind that restaurants probably count as private property for the purposes of this law, so it's better to keep the recording areas limited to public streets, sidewalks, parks, and government buildings that are open to the public (town hall meetings and the like... for safety concerns, do not try it at schools during the course of normal business... recording your kids basketball game or pageant solo is fine... but not during the normal school day).Do you feel comfortable discussing what you intend to use the footage for?

The general rule is that the person who owns the property must maintain the property. There are often local ordinances that explicitly say that,  guidance on tree-trimming.

{"question":"In the United States, what is the threshold for \"originality\" in order to have copyright protection? says that copyright protection subsists \"in original works of authorship...\". How original does the work need to be?","answer":"<h3>Originality requires independent creation plus a modicum of creativity<\/h3>This was answered in Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc.,  (1991):originality requires independent creation plus a modicum of creativity.Original, as the term is used in copyright, means only that the work was independently created by the author (as opposed to copied from other works), and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity. To be sure, the requisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice. The vast majority of works make the grade quite easily, as they possess some creative spark, &quot;no matter how crude, humble or obvious&quot; it might be. Originality does not signify novelty; a work may be original even though it closely resembles other works, so long as the similarity is fortuitous, not the result of copying. [Citations removed]This connection to creativity is explained more in the , citing entirely from Feist.The US Copyright Office presents eleven categories of things that &quot;do not satisfy the creativity requirement&quot;<sup>1<\/sup> (308.2; ):mere copiesde minimis authorship: &quot;copyright protects only those constituent elements of a work that possess more than a de minimis quantum of creativity&quot; (citing Feist, p. 363); e.g. substitution of pronouns, correction of spelling, three-note sequences, are not sufficiently creativewords and short phrasesworks consisting entirely of information that is common property; e.g. calendars, schedules of sporting eventsmeasuring and computing devices (with the exception of separable creative features distinct from what makes the article useful)listings of ingredients or contentsblank formscharacterssc\u00e8nes \u00e0 fairefamiliar symbols and designsmere variations of coloring<h3>Canada has taken a different approach<\/h3>For a comparative look, Canada has rejected creativity as the hallmark of originality. In CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada, , the Supreme Court considered the standard from Feist but took a different approach:an original work under the Copyright Act is one that originates from an author and is not copied from another work. That alone, however, is not sufficient to find that something is original. In addition, an original work must be the product of an author's exercise of skill and judgment. The exercise of skill and judgment required to produce the work must not be so trivial that it could be characterized as a purely mechanical exercise. While creative works will by definition be original and covered by copyright, creativity is not required to make a work original.<h3>Application<\/h3>Many answers on this site apply this standard.

{"question":"Chris died and named three co-executors.The estate involves property but no complications, so informal probate seems viable.For various reasons, the co-executors want one person to be named executor and another a successor executor, in case the first executor gets sick, dies, or whatever.In the Utah state code, I found this:Enacted by Chapter 150, 1975 General Session75-3-609 Termination of appointment -- Death or disability.The death of a personal representative or the appointment of a conservator for the estate of a personal representative, terminates his appointment. Until appointment and qualification of a successor or special representative to replace the deceased or protected representative, the representative of the estate of the deceased or protected personal representative, if any, has theduty to protect the estate possessed and being administered by his decedent or ward at the time his appointment terminates, has the power to perform acts necessary for protection, and shall account for and deliver the estate assets to a successor or special personal representative upon his appointment and qualification.Question 1It appears that the statute names the executor of the personal representative's estate as the \"default\" successor executor.This is a situation we want to avoid. Instead, we want to have one of the initially named co-executors be ready to immediately step in.Can this be done? Via a form? (I wasn't able to spot the one that might be of interest at this link:Question 2Assume that the co-executors want to go that route after all, and still via informal probate? How is that handled? Do you just add all three names to UUPC Form 10 (Application to be a Personal Representative)?","answer":"  Question 1    It appears that the statute names the executor of the personal  representative's estate as the 'default' successor executor.

(I wasn't able to spot the one that  might be of interest at this link:    Not really. The PR of the estate of the PR is merely obligated to act as a caretaker until a successor is appointed, if there is no co-PR to handle that task. If there are three co-PRs, there is really no need to have a successor appointed. The two can continue to act where the three acted before. But, if all PRs fail to act or have their positions terminate, then a new PR needs to be appointed by the Court because the Letters issued by the Court is the source of a PR's authority.The language of the Will, and in the absence of language in the Will, the Probate Code, governs how successors are appointed. The fact that 'the co-executors want one person to be named executor and another a successor executor, in case the first executor gets sick, dies, or whatever.', is immaterial. They don't get to make those rules. Often a Will permits co-executors to delegate their authority or authority over part of their job, to one person, however. Look in the boilerplate of the Will.  Question 2    Assume that the co-executors want to go that route after all, and  still via informal probate? How is that handled? Do you just add all  three names to UUPC Form 10 (Application to be a Personal  Representative)?Yes, co-executors can be appointed via informal probate by putting three names on Form 10, assuming that this is what the Will provides."}
{"question":"In the 1970s, one after another of the U.S. states switched to . This is, divorce could be granted to couples without either one of them proving that the other had committed certain offenses that qualified as \"faults\" (adultery, desertion, etc.)Yet, my understanding is that \"marital behavior\" is a factor in determining the terms of the divorce. That is alimony, property division, child custody, etc. Are these actually \"fault\" issues?To what extent are the above items distributed on \"equitable\" (economic) grounds, and to what extent are they decided on \"fault\" grounds relating to marital conduct?This question could apply to any of the United States, but the ones I'm most interested in are the ones I've lived in, that is, New York and California.","answer":"<h3>The Adoption Of No Fault Divorce In The U.S.<\/h3>Every U.S. state has no fault divorce, and in almost every state, this is available unilaterally even if one spouse doesn't want to end the marriage. California was the first U.S. state to adopt no fault divorce, which it did in 1970 under legislation adopted in 1969. New York State was the very last U.S. state to adopt &quot;no fault divorce&quot;, and it did so .But in  in a no fault divorce by thirty days.)Fault based divorces  in the States of Wisconsin, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Nebraska, Montana, Missouri, Minnesota, Michigan, Kentucky, Kansas, Iowa, Indiana, Hawaii, Florida, Colorado and California.In other U.S. states and in the District of Columbia, both fault based and no fault based divorces are available, although no fault divorces are more common than fault based divorces in every U.S. state and in the District of Columbia.<h3>Economic Waste<\/h3>All or almost all U.S. states recognize the concept of &quot;economic waste&quot; of marital property. So, if, in anticipation of a divorce or during its pendency, a spouse, for example, destroys property that this spouse controls, or otherwise intentionally or recklessly disposes of it for far less than what it is worth, the loss of value to the marital estate from the act of &quot;economic waste&quot; is charged to the offending spouse.In some states, merely grossly negligent or negligent conduct can constitute economic waste as well, but that would be a minority rule.Conduct Relevant To The Best Interests Of The ChildParenting time and parental responsibilities are universally adjudicated under a &quot;best interests of the child&quot; standard.So, conduct that is specifically relevant to the parent-child relationship of the parties (e.g. driving drunk with the kids in the car, or not feeding the kids regularly), may be considered with respect to decisions on parenting time and parental responsibilities (a.k.a. custody and visitation determinations), on a case by case, fact intensive basis.But conduct of a parent that does not directly impact parent-child interactions of either spouse (e.g. an adulterous affair of a spouse of which the children have no knowledge), may not be considered for that purpose.<h3>Marital Misconduct Or Marital Fault Is Usually Not Considered For Child Support<\/h3>Due to federal welfare benefit legislation that sets requirements for child support laws to make states eligible for federal benefits, child support is determined by a formula (not exactly the same in every state but quite similar in practice) that doesn't consider marital misconduct or marital fault either.There are two main exceptions to this rule.First, in a rule similar to the economic waste rule, income can be imputed to a parent of a child for purposes of calculating child support if a parent intentionally earns less than the parent is capable of earning.Second, the guidelines do not apply beyond a threshold child support amount for high income parents, in which cases the child support award is discretionary and similar to an alimony award which may consider fault in some states where fault may be considered for alimony purposes in  those cases. The exact dollar amount of the threshold varies from state to state and from year to year, but is typically a combined gross income of both parents on the order of $75,000 to $200,000 per year.<h3>Marital Fault or Marital Misconduct In Property Division and Alimony Awards<\/h3>States vary in the extent that marital fault may be considered for purposes of property division and for purposes of alimony awards.In states that consider fault for property division and alimony, usually both no fault divorce and fault based divorce options are available, and marital fault or martial misconduct may usually be considered for these purposes only in fault based divorce filings.Colorado and a majority of other U.S. states do not considering marital misconduct or marital fault (other than &quot;economic waste&quot; or conduct relevant to parenting) in either property division or alimony awards.Some states openly consider marital fault in property division and alimony awards. A handful of states (most notably ) have &quot;heart balm&quot; torts like &quot;alienation of affections&quot; that effectively allow someone to sue the &quot;other man&quot; or &quot;other woman&quot; who had an affair with their spouse for money damages. Mostly, but not entirely, martial fault or marital misconduct other than economic waste is a permissible consideration in &quot;red states&quot; in the Great Plains, Appalachia, and the South. Marital fault based tort awards are rare but allowed in theory in Illinois, Hawaii and New Mexico, but restrictions on proof of liability for theses torts make it exceedingly difficult to prevail in an alienation of affections case and recover substantial monetary damages. It is also possible to bring these tort suits with a lower standard of proof in Utah and South Dakota, which continue to have actively litigated alienation of affections suits, although the tort is not used as often in these states as it is in North Carolina and Mississippi.Some states that do not have heart balm torts, however, can still consider martial fault in property division and in alimony awards, at least in fault based divorce cases.CaliforniaIn California, the community property regime does not consider marital fault in property division. This is also true in all other states that have full fledged community property regimes: Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.New York StateThe legal culture in New York State to some extent probably does implicitly consider marital fault, since intuitions of legal practitioners and judges don't change as quickly as the law does, even though it should not consider this since consideration of marital fault in property division and alimony was abolished as a consideration in New York State in 2010. New York State's common law derived system of equitable property division is much more discretionary than that of California, which makes it easier for fault based intuitions of legal practitioners and judges to intrude on how cases are resolved sub silentio.But marital fault or marital misconduct (other than &quot;economic waste&quot; discussed above) is not among the factors that may be considered in New York State by statute. Old case law to the contrary has been superseded legislatively.Appellate Review oF Marital Fault Consideration Is Difficult To PerfectOne reason that pre-no fault practice can have enduring influence on post-fault decision making by judges in New York (most of whom practiced law for most of their careers pre-2010 when property division and alimony awards in New York considered fault), is that there are few effective means of overturning on appeal a decision that covertly considers these factors.This is because, in practice, it is  quite hard to review on appeal an improper consideration of marital fault in a New York State property division or alimony award.The court has broad discretion to equitably divide property and to make an alimony award, considering fact rich evidence that can reveal marital fault incidentally. And, in a fault based divorce (which still exists in New York along with no fault divorces), the evidence may have even been admitted properly and may have resulted in judicial findings of fact, for the other lawful purpose of determining valid grounds for a fault based divorce were present.Also, divorce decrees are entered by judges, and for appellate purposes, unless a judge expressly states in an oral or written ruling that an impermissible factor was considered, a judge is presumed to have ignored legally irrelevant evidence presented to the judge in a hearing or pleadings, even if evidence of marital fault is improperly admitted into evidence over the other party's objection, or is admitted into evidence without a preserved evidentiary objection.Also, often a judge will not make particularly detailed findings of fact or conduct details analysis of the court's reasoning in writing or orally, beyond a bare minimum of factual detail necessary to state what the find decision of the court was in the case and to make jurisdictionally required findings of fact. Judges are busy and they often due the bare minimum of work to resolve cases in ordinary divorces that come before them to decide.So, usually, the fact that marital fault evidence was presented at a permanent orders hearing in a divorce will not provide a basis for reversing a decision on appeal, even though it is plausible under the circumstances that the judge's decision on property division or alimony was influenced by marital fault."}

{"question":"My understanding of Title IX is that it is a federal law that requires, among other organizations, universities, to ensure that women are not denied equal opportunities. In order to ensure compliance with this law, universities create their own policies that they believe tackle relevant misconduct like sexual harassment, stalking, and other related behaviors. However the Title IX office of a university does not attempt to tackle behaviors that fall outside of ensuring compliance with the federal law.Usually, faculty and staff are required to report or consult with the Title IX office if they become aware of misconduct. However, there is also a belief I have encountered that legally, academic personnel must then 'back off' and completely withdraw from any conversations, actions, or other matters that relate to the issue and allow the Title IX office alone to handle it.Is there any form of legal concern for an academic department, or faculty\/staff, acting on this information further? For example, can a department chair enact sanctions on a perpetrator? Can faculty confront the perpetrator and demand their behavior cease? Can it even be discussed without legal ramifications?Note that I am not asking about university policies on this kind of further action, but what the law and legal concerns would be. I will ask a similar question about policies on Academia Stack Exchange.","answer":"There is no (statutory\/regulatory) legal basis at all for claiming that a department, chair, faculty member or other individuals must 'back off' in the face of a Title IX claim. However, the chair and department could face civil liability for violating the rights of the accused (depending on what the action taken was). This assume that there is no university rule mandating 'backing off' \u2013 violating university rules may have consequences.The possibility of civil consequences arises if the university (via the department or the chair) violates their contract with the accused, by penalizing the person contrary to the terms of the contract (look for the grievance clause). However, academic units are usually set up in such a way that 'the department' can't do anything, but the chair can, perhaps following a vote of the faculty. The faculty could denounce the accused, but as long as they didn't cross the line to defamation they can express themselves as they see fit. The chair, on the other hand, probably has the power to actually punish the accused, and would need to back off somewhat. For example, the faculty might wish to impose a substantive sanction, but they almost certainly don't have the power to do so, whereas the chair probably does. So the chair needs to check that his actions, as The administrative officer in the department acting as the agent of the university, do not constitute breach of contract w.r.t. the accused."}
{"question":"The owner of a local fast-food restaurant has enacted a new policy that requires employees to say 'Be Blessed' to all customers as they leave. If an employee refuses to say it, disciplinary action is taken up to and including termination.Does an employee terminated for refusal to follow this policy have grounds for any legal action such as religious discrimination?","answer":"It probably depends on whether the employer is covered by a relevant non-discrimination statute. Most employers in the United States are covered, but some are small enough to be exempt.  exempts employers with under 15 employees and religious organizations. There might also be a relevant state law.It also would depend upon whether the EEOC or a court found that 'be blessed' was a compelled religious statement in violation of a worker's beliefs, and whether allowing the worker not to say it would be a 'reasonable accommodation.' This is a strong case, and I suspect that the worker would win on both counts but it isn't a completely open and shut case. There is arguably a secular meaning to the word 'blessed' and a court could conceivably find that there is a legitimate and indispensible business purpose for insisting that every single person in the worker's position need to make this statement, although I doubt that a court would do so."}
{"question":"Is there some kind of disclosure immunity if you violate your non-disclosure agreement to reveal fraud? In the United States, is there some kind of law that protects people when they violate their NDA in order to show that a crime was committed be it fraud or something else?","answer":"In general, under the common law,  a contract cannot validly require a person to commit or abet a crime. Thus if an NDA requires one to lie about or actively cover up a crime, it is void (in that aspect, at least). But there is, in most cases, no affirmative duty to report a crime, except for certain individuals in particular situations. Thus an NDA that simply requires silence may be valid.There have been many Federal and state laws passed to protect so-called &quot;whistleblowers&quot; (people who draw attention to criminal or improper actions of which they have confidential knowledge. Many of these are listed and described in the Wikipedia article  Exactly what protection is offered varies widely. Many of these deal with public employees or government contractors, not private employees.In the case of  the US Supreme Court held that statements made in the course of a person's position as a public employee, rather than as a private citizen, have no First Amendment protection against employer discipline.Whether a private employee will be protected against retaliation or the penalties listed in an NDA depends on the area of the alleged violation, and the specific facts of the case. One would be wise to consult a lawyer knowledgeable in this specific field before relying on such protections."}
{"question":"I'm wondering about the legal practice in different countries.If a person forms a limited liability company (LLC), and then completely abandons it, e.g. doesn't file taxes for the company etc., what will happen? (for example, due to sudden illness)In my experience, the company would be penalized, then declared bankrupt, and closed. But the owner would not be liable for any penalties, because he is technically considered a shareholder. At the same time though, he is also the director of the company. In some countries, it seems that the director is liable and personally penalizeable for failing to submit documents. And that the owner is automatically declared the director of the company, thus becoming personally liable for what should otherwise be a limited liability.Is this difference based in the fundamental legal philosophy of a country?I'm located in Bulgaria, and as is well known, there are many problems, but mainly with enforcement and malpractice. I care about the development of the country, and it seems that pressures from the EU has made it a lot easier to start a limited liability company. The capital requirement has been reduced to 1 euro, and all the official measures have been reduced, e.g. how much time it takes to create a company, online registration, bureaucratic burdens and so on. But what they haven't reduced, is the reporting requirements. The accounting costs are incredibly high. To submit documents, you have to pay stamp taxes and similar 'publication' taxes. In short, I can easily imagine a situation where a low-income individual seeks to start a business of their own, but, as most low-income small-business-owners who have never had a business before, would easily be at risk of failing to keep it operational. But closing a company takes a minimum of 10 months and requires numerous bureaucratic steps.This leaves me wondering whether there is a fundamental legal-philosophical difference, as opposed to northern-European countries (or USA, Australia, Canada etc.).And fundamentally whether, as @davidgo points out, that there is a significant risk that a 'limited liability company' can in fact, even without any activity, quickly become an enormous inescapable financial burden. Penalties for failing to comply with reporting requirements (which are very strict and numerous) can equal 2-3 months (~1200 EUR) of an average salary (400 EUR\/month), per year.I'm, quite frankly, outraged, but the locals are saying 'well, that's Bulgaria' or 'of course', without any hint of critical reflection.","answer":"Details vary by jurisdiction but, in general, a shareholder has no liability (more precisely their liability is limited to the value of their shares or guarantee) but a director can be civilly or criminally liable if they fail to discharge their duties as a director. These duties are related to but distinct from the duties the company itself has. In general, director's duties are owed only to the government and the shareholders - not to the public at large."}
{"question":"Can a judge order a juror to return for jury duty based on the juror's answer in voir dire?I observed the following in a Texas court.  During voir dire a juror was asked,Would you hold it against the defendant and plaintiff if they both cannot speak English and require translators?The juror answered, 'Yes, I believe they should speak English when a citizen of the U.S.'The judge stood up, threw down his pen, and yelled at the juror for this answer, and then ordered the juror to continue to return for jury duty until the judge found a case in which he felt the juror could be fair.Is this allowed?  If not, what recourse does someone have in such a situation?","answer":"This is probably allowed, unless Texas has a 1 day or 1 case rule (which is common but hardly universal), in which case the potential juror could only be held for one day.A juror can be compelled to be a juror against his will in any case in which he is qualified to serve. Usually, the legal authority of a court to compel a person to serve as a juror is much broader than the usual process for obtaining a juror.If lack of impartiality in a particular case for case specific reasons disqualifies a person from serving on a particular jury, that doesn't mean that the person is disqualified from serving on all juries.The judge's outburst isn't wonderful as a matter of judicial decorum, but the outburst probably doesn't undermine the judge's authority to compel the potential juror to serve in some jury pool. Ideally, this would have been expressed more calmly, but the bottom line is that you have a legal duty to show up and serve if you are qualified and a judge has broad discretion to see that this duty is fulfilled. Lots of people who will ultimately be dismissed without serving in a particular case end up having to sit around while the process determines if they are qualified to serve in any case.Also, the judge is within his rights to punish the potential juror if he determines that the potential juror is actually lying about his ability to be impartial in an effort to evade jury service rather than because he sincerely believes that he can't be fair, and judges have wide authority to determine the credibility and truthfulness of statements made to him in open court (i.e. if the trial judge finds that you are lying, this determination will almost always be honored by an appellate court considering the judge's actions).If someone complained about the judge's conduct to a judicial ethics body in Texas, the judge would very likely receive a private reprimand or maybe if the ethics panel was particularly incensed, a public reprimand, but only because he lost his cool on the bench, not because he required the potential juror to stick around until another suitable case could be found."}
{"question":"Let's say that someone has made me their Power of Attorney and I don't want that kind of responsibility on my hands. Is there a way to deny it? I am in the state of Wisconsin.","answer":"You can not be 'made a Power of Attorney.'  Power of Attorney is a legal authorization that grants authority to an Agent to act on the Grantor's behalf in some capacity.Because it is not a contract, but rather a unilateral authorization, the Grantor cannot impose responsibility or obligations through Power of Attorney, and therefore there is nothing for a Grantee to 'deny.'However, typically some agreement (i.e., contract) accompanies the grant of Power of Attorney, in which case you would be bound by the terms of such an agreement."}
{"question":"1. \"Discretionary\" and \"mandatory\" dollarsMy general understanding of the federal budget process in the USA is that: must be \"appropriated\" by the House of Representatives every year, following ideas from Article I Sections 7 or 9 or something. is not subject to this requirement.2. This Congress can't bind a future Congress (?)However, my layman's understanding of Congress's power also includes the notion that \"this Congress can't bind a future Congress\".  Googling around has provided many instances of politicians and even law professors invoking this notion, but no authoritative source.   Some (perhaps only weak) form of this principle must be true; otherwise this Congress could say \"no new laws can be passed after 2030 except by a 4\/5s majority in Congress\" or whatever, effectively stripping future Congresses of all of their power.3. So, \"mandatory\" for whom?Thus I think my question is, for whom is the spending \"mandatory\"?  Future Congresses?  Could they just do a simple majority vote (assuming the President signs it) to alter \"mandatory\" spending?  If so, is it really \"mandatory\"?  And how would it then substantively differ from \"discretionary\" spending?  Is \"mandatory\" really just an escape clause from requiring Appropriations by the House of Representatives?","answer":"My understanding is that &quot;Discretionary&quot; and &quot;Mandatory&quot; spending terms are not legal terms so much as political terms.A future Congress certainly can legally choose to reduce spending on an essential service like Social Security checks, or interest payments on US Debt, but it would have significant social and political repercussions that leave Congress with very little choice but to continue the spending with at most minor changes.If they did make substantial changes, the results could be disastrous. If Social Security payments were significantly cut, Senior Citizens could be unable to pay rent, or go hungry.  If interest payments weren't reliable, the Credit of the USA would be demolished, and we would likely be in an instant Economic Depression.This spending is termed &quot;Mandatory&quot;.The wiki article you linked to in your question even states:Congress can only reduce the funding for programs by changing the authorization law itself.

I doubt anyone would have any statute they could point to to arrest you for using one.  However, if you use one to avoid grounding a device and the building burns down or a user gets electrocuted, a determined prosecutor just might decide to attempt to send you to prison via some type of negligence charge.Your insurance company might also decide to void your coverage, and if you have a business that has fire marshal inspections, expect to get dinged if they see one.  It is also theoretically possible that an OSHA fine could come your way for such usage, but unless someone dies, highly unlikely, thanks @JonCuster.Clearly the sale of these items isn't restricted, and they are required in some older home wiring in the USA to allow grounding via a center-screw grounding that used to be a thing.  They are known as grounding converters.  US Homes were built with grounding outlets in the 1960s, homes I am familiar with that didn't have them were pre-war."}
{"question":"Can a fugitive make a pleading in court to quash the warrant for their arrest?For example, let's imagine a warrant has been issued for the arrest of some person who is nowhere to be found, but against whom no indictment has been made, and an attorney for that person comes to court and complains that the warrant is defective because it was made on the basis of false testimony or is in some other way invalid.Can the court refuse to hear the pleading under English Common Law? What about the current practice in the United States?","answer":"  Can a fugitive make a pleading in court to quash the warrant for their  arrest?Sort-of yes, but in practical terms no.Summary:A fugitive cannot seek the assistance of a court of which they are in contempt, but that is unlikely to apply. In any case, it is discretionary.There is probably no rule against such a pleading.A lawyer would be ethically prohibited from filing such a pleading, because they cannot represent a fugitive while he or she remains at large.In the scenario of interest, the fugitive has not been indicted. That means that the arrest warrant must have been issued in a stand-alone proceeding, as distinct from a bench warrant (which is only issued if the accused fails to appear at a hearing and is therefore found to be in contempt). I am also assuming that the fugitive is hiding, not merely out of reach. That is, they are probably still within the jurisdiction but the authorities can't find them. The situation is different if the authorities know where the fugitive is but they are out of jurisdiction e.g. Julian Assange.Where a person, having been convicted of an offence and filed an appeal, subsequently goes on the run, the court may (in its discretion) dismiss their appeal on the basis that the appellant is no longer under the control of the court: Smith v United States (1876) 94 US 97. This is similar to the rule that a court may refuse to hear applications by a party who is in contempt of that court and\/or has indicated that they will disobey the court's order if it is not favourable to them. The underlying principle relates to a court's inherent power to protect its own dignity and foster the obedience of its orders.However, the fugitive dismissal rule only applies where the person goes on the run during an appeal, not if they go on the run before filing for an appeal: Ortega-Rodriguez v United States (1993) 507 US 234. By analogy, it would probably not prevent a person from filing a writ while a warrant for their arrest is outstanding.The outcome may be different for a bench warrant. In such a scenario, the fugitive is in contempt of the court to which they may be applying to challenge the warrant (although they may be applying to a different court, e.g. to a federal court to challenge a warrant issued by a state court). In such a case, the court may exercise its discretion to refuse to hear applications on behalf of the fugitive until they submit to the court's jurisdiction by surrendering themselves.Talking more generally (covering the scenario where the fugitive dismissal rule does not apply), the issue of whether the party can attend court without being arrested usually relates to their ability to give evidence as a witness (rather than their ability to actually file a claim or a defence). For example, Roman Polanski, who has been a fugitive from US authorities for some time, sued a magazine for defamation in 2005 in the UK. He had no problem getting his claim filed through his lawyers but ran into issues when the success of his claim required him to give evidence himself. Ultimately he was allowed to give evidence by video link because by entering the UK he would risk being arrested and extradited to the US. The House of Lords held that to deny him the opportunity to give evidence by video link would deny him any access to justice: . (The tension between the self-inflicted nature of fugitive status and the principle of access to justice is discussed at, among other places, paragraphs 30 and 31.) You are talking about quashing an arrest warrant, not defamation, but they're both civil proceedings and the principles are the same.However, another issue in this scenario is the fact that a lawyer cannot, ethically, represent the client while the client remains at large. There are conflicting opinions on whether a lawyer, contacted by a fugitive, is bound to disclose the fugitive's location to the authorities or whether this information is privileged. Such a scenario raises a conflict between the lawyer's duty of confidence to the client and their duty to the legal system. However, everyone agrees that a lawyer must, even if they decide to maintain the confidence of this information, advise their client to surrender themselves and withdraw from the case if they refuse to follow that advice. See e.g. .Therefore, while there is generally no rule formally prohibiting a fugitive from challenging a warrant for their arrest while they are at large, in practice they could not do so because they cannot attend court in person nor can they get a lawyer to do so on their behalf. Therefore, a fugitive must surrender themselves and then try to sort out any errors in what they have been accused of. As it went in The Fugitive, 'I didn't kill my wife' ... 'I don't care.'"}
{"question":"Could the local US governors\/mayors, who reject federal agents on their streets, legally order their local police force to arrest all people, who are violence and don't wear any insignia?Or would it be illegal for them to arrest the federal agents, even when they don't wear any insignia showing their role as federal agents?","answer":"Revised for clarity in light of commentsState and local police can arrest anyone who they have probable cause to believe is breaking state or local law.Like all LEOs, Federal LEOs can break some state and local laws while enforcing Federal law. When they  and hold them in a cell, they are detaining them, not kidnapping them, and so on. However, to avoid arrest, the Feds have to identify themselves. That's because state and local LEO who know they are dealing with Feds on federal business no longer have probable cause to believe a crime is being committed.State and local police can arrest Federal LEOs who they: a) have probable cause to believe are breaking state or local; and, b) have no reason to believe are Feds enforcing Federal law. In other words: Any Fed who refuses to identify herself to a local LEO can be arrested if there is probable cause.State and local police cannot, however, arrest Federal LEOs just because they are not wearing insignias. That is because: a) there are no federal statutes requiring federal LEOs to identify themselves; b) the  says federal law takes precedence over state and local law that conflict with it; c) at least in Portland, the feds were not operating under any sort of formal agreement with Portland or Oregon officials that required them to have identification.While it is hard to prove a negative, the question of whether Federal LEOs are required to identify themselves has been looked at recently by reputable sources. They all agree there is no such law. For example, the answer from :Broadly speaking, law enforcement officers do not have a legal duty to disclose either their identities or their agencies of affiliation, even if asked directly. Certain municipalities require police officers to identify themselves if asked, but there is currently no federal statute requiring officer disclosure of such information.The article points out that the two main types of cases involving police identifying themselves really don't apply: police who are working undercover, notably in sting operations, and police searching and seizing property.They go on to point out:Separate from the question of federal law, several states have adopted laws and regulations requiring law enforcement to identify themselves. For example, under New York City's Right to Know Act, a broad set of police reforms that went into effect in October 2018, officers must tell civilians at the start of some interactions their name, rank, command, and shield number.(Also, many departments have policies that generally require officers to identify themselves, although with exceptions. You can see examples of the policies .)Again, these local laws do not apply to Feds because of the Supremacy Clause.NOTE: As several of the news stories note, the lack of identification will make it very hard to hold Federal LEOs accountable for their actions. Accountability requires identity."}
{"question":"I'm wondering what would have happened if one of the passengers who was witnessing the  unfold had stepped in and tried to defend the doctor, by force.Note that I'm assuming the circumstances are exactly as they played out here; for example, the officer (if he was really a police officer) is not obviously dressed as one, so you'd have to make your own inference as to whether he was a police officer.Specifically, I'm wondering what would happen if someone saw the doctor was being visibly injured and you punch\/kick\/etc. the officer to try to separate the two, in defense of the doctor. I imagine you'd be arrested and in jail until your trial, but I'm wondering what would happen afterward. Is this likely to be considered a defensive move and could you be found not guilty if you were taken to court? And if you're taken to court and found guilty, what would the consequences be like -- a few days behind bars maybe, or a years-long prison sentence?Assume you're not trying to permanently injure the officer here, just some temporary\/minor injuries so he gets the message. The goal is obviously to defend the other guy with a bit of force, not to attack the officer and make him fear for his life. So by the time the court date rolls around, he'll at most have a bruise, if anything.(Editorial note: Yes, the better passenger-initiated solution would've  been for someone else to give up their seat, but if for whatever reason you didn't do that and this was the only option left...)","answer":"I suspect that you would not be convicted in the present case, because the jury would be sympathetic to the plight of the person being dragged out and unsympathetic to the behavior of the draggers. However, we should set aside the emotional elements of a jury trial and focus on legal principles. The basic question is whether a person has the right to use force to : 'a person is privileged to use such force as reasonably appears necessary to defend him or herself against an apparent threat of unlawful and immediate violence from another'. This right to defense also extends to defense of others. But it has to appear to be to unlawful, which is to say, you have to reasonably believe that the force used against the victim is unlawful. If a couple of thugs try to drag a person away, then an observer probably has a reasonable belief that this is an unlawful battery. But if a couple of police officers are observed dragging a person away (arresting him), apparently acting officially, the force used (up to a point) is apparently lawful and would not constitute battery of the victim. For defensive force against police to be lawful, the forced used by the police must be excessive.The outcome then depends on what a reasonable person would conclude (this is where the jury or judge makes a rather subjective decision). If a reasonable person would conclude that the assailants are acting lawfully in arresting the person, then a higher bar must be clear to justifiably use force in defense of others. Wearing a jacket that says 'Police' favors the 'appears lawful' side (though if you happened to know for a fact that the person wearing the jacket is not a police officer, then the 'police exception' would not be applicable). In the relevant case, the facts point to the appearance of a lawful arrest (even if were to turn out to be judged unlawful).In the case that this is an apparent arrest, it would have to be the case that a reasonable person would find the force used to be excessive. Generally speaking, force used by officers is held to be reasonable, except in some cases where it is not. See for example the matter of , where the officers involved were not indicted. On the third hand, in this case, it might matter what the actual legal status of the 'officers' is (they are not Chicago police)."}

{"question":"Many states (for example, ) around the US have issued an executive order prohibiting their residents from interacting with other citizens face-to-face, unless its a part of an 'essential' activity:All people in Washington State shall immediately cease participating in all public  and private gatherings and multi-person activities for social, spiritual and  recreational purposes, regardless of the number of people involved, except as  specifically identified herein. Such activity includes, but is not limited to, community,  civic, public, leisure, faith-based, or sporting events; parades; concerts; festivals;  conventions; fundraisers; and similar activities. This prohibition also applies to planned  wedding and funeral events. This prohibition shall remain in effect until midnight on  April 6, 2020, unless extended beyond that date.Is there precedent in US law for such a restriction? Or perhaps someone already tried to challenge this rule during the current pandemic? Preventing citizens from going to each others home for a visit seems like the ultimate form of restrictions, so it would be interesting to see if it ever held up in court.","answer":"I think the Washington law and order is fairly clear: you must stay home unless you are engaged in certain allowed activities. The underlying law,  empowers issuing an order prohibiting 'Such other activities as he or she reasonably believes should be prohibited to help preserve and maintain life, health, property or the public peace'. Therefore I can walk my dog. When I do, there are a lot of people also out walking their dogs, so that provides a letter-of-the-law permitted exception to the stay-at-home order. Nothing in the order specifically addresses the situation where you pause your dog-walk to talk to a neighbor (the 'appropriate social distancing' sub-rule only applies to recreational departures from your home).It is well-established that the central legal issue is what the 'compelling government interest' is, and whether these restrictions fail on grounds of narrow-tailoring or least-restrictiveness. The failure to include 'go to your brother's place for lunch, provided you follow appropriate social distancing guidelines' as a permitted activity is a candidate for not being least-restrictive. The problem is that the courts will not engage in an infinite regress of second-guessings about whether certain measures are 'truly necessary'.There is a , but a SCOTUS order requires the state to reply to a petition by Monday. The 'status quo' is that these orders are legal, until someone constructs a compelling argument that they are not, and that matter is then resolved in favor of petitioner by SCOTUS (which has not happened). So far, governors have prevailed at the state level."}
{"question":"Note: I have little to no idea about how the law behind this works, I will try to cite my claims as well as I can.The title of the question is a bit hard to understand but I'll specify it here:Let's imagine I live in Germany, which is part of the EU, where comparative advertisement seems to be banned.I get an ad on a platform like YouTube, which is an American company, where comparative advertising is most definitely allowed under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act).This imaginary ad I get is some company comparing themselves to another. Both of those countries have their headquarters in countries where comparative advertising is allowed.Would the law technically allow Youtube to serve that ad?[1]: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Comparative_advertising#European_Union[2]: https:\/\/www.kelleydrye.com\/getattachment\/7befe471-fd7b-46a9-9177-755b5eccd246\/attachment.aspx","answer":"This will ultimately depend on the specific laws, but the scope of EU laws like Directive 2006\/114\/EC is generally restricted to the EU Single Market. Thus, we would have to consider whether the advertisement in question is directed at that market.In your scenario, you have two US-based companies that engage in comparative advertising via an US-based platform. But where these companies are headquartered is not directly relevant, as non-EU companies can participate in the EU Single Market as well. Instead, EU rules are applicable if either:the comparative advertising occurred in the context of the activities of an EU establishment such as an EU-based subsidiary; orthe advertising was directed to a country in the EU Single Market, for example by fulfilling the criteria listed in the .For example, lets assume that the companies do not have a direct EU presence, but that they offer goods or services to consumers in the EU and the comparative advertisement was in German and mentioned prices in Euros. If so, there would be a good argument that EU rules apply and that the comparative advertising was potentially illegal.But as another example, lets consider two restaurants\/diners in Memphis, Tennessee, US, that made unfair comparative advertisements which were distributed via YouTube. It is possible to view the advertisement from the EU. But is there any reason for this ad to be illegal in the EU? No. This ad falls out of scope of EU law as the ad is not directed towards the EU Single Market, and it is unlikely to mislead consumers in the sense of fair competition laws as there won't be any potential customers for the Memphis restaurant in the EU. National laws could take a more narrow approach though.Does YouTube have any responsibility here? No, fair competition laws generally only address the competitors, not the platforms through which advertisements are distributed (e.g. newspapers or social media platforms). Online platforms with user-generated consent benefit from safe-harbor laws. However, there are some legal theories such as the German St?rerhaftung under which it might be possible to hold an otherwise-privileged service provider responsible for acts committed by an unknown third party.Note that while comparative marketing is quite regulated in the EU and thus rare, it is not actually illegal when done fairly. For example in Germany,?6 UWG defines criteria to determine whether comparative advertising is unfair."}
{"question":"I am located in Colorado, USA.We own a house that has a rented home behind it.  There is a retaining wall between the two properties.  We have checked on the county assessor's website and the retaining wall is entirely on their side of the property line, and the neighboring property is lower and was excavated to be level, creating the need for the retaining wall.  Based on all of that, it is my current understanding that it is the responsibility of the neighbor to maintain the retaining wall, which is over 30 years old, wood, and crumbling to the point that there are large sections of exposed dirt currently being held up by nothing. The problem is, despite the tenant in the house telling us that about a year before we bought the property the landlord had an estimator out to look at it, and more recently she told us they said that they'd have another estimate done over a month ago, nothing has happened.  I have had to brace the fence to keep it from falling over as the dirt around the fence posts erodes away.  The property management company \/ owner are very unresponsive and do not seem very keen on repairs based on the visible condition of the property (rotting window frames) and the tenant telling us about other repairs she has requested not being done.I had even contacted a few companies to see about doing the repairs myself but they declined as they could not get the permits as the work would not be on my property.  I have set aside some money to cover probably the entire cost of the work, and definitely half, but as this is a rental and therefore the owner is profiting from it, I would only want to help pay for their maintenance as a last resort if they ask for it.  There are other repairs to our own home we could use that money for as well as we bought this as a bit of a fixer upper.What options do I have legally to get them to actually repair this retaining wall before it falls?","answer":"The legal responsibilities of landlords, tenant-landlord laws and any laws dealing with structures such as retaining walls are all very local in nature; they will depend on the laws in your town\/city and county in Colorado, as well as state law.The best thing to do is call your local city or county building inspectors office and tell them that there is a retaining wall that is failing; they will inspect it and send letters to the property owner (and probably you) outlining the legal requirements and who is responsible for the required mitigations.The rental property owner should not ignore a letter from the building inspector; there is too much legal liability. The inspector may also flag other problems with the rental property and will require they be fixed, or make referrals to other government agencies.The tenant should also contact local legal aid and tenant organizations if they get push back or no response from the landlord."}

For general sidewalk purposes, it depends on whether your town has a law requiring you to clear the ice.

{"question":" against abortion bans has been the mother's health. Specifically, where pregnancy could risk an early-pregnancy death of both the kid and the mother.If a mother was not able to get an abortion, and both died in, say, a federal hospital (like a VA hospital), could you sue the Federal Government under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for negligence even if there was a local\/state abortion ban in place?","answer":"The Federal Tort Claims Act provides a limited waiver of of federal sovereign immunity for certain claims, among them, negligence in the provision of medical services by health care providers at certain federal health care facilities (i.e. for certain medical malpractice cases).A claim for medical malpractice asserts that a health care provider failed to use reasonable care in a manner consistent with care that a reasonable ordinary practitioners of the type of medical profession in which they performed their services should perform, causing harm to a patient.What constitutes reasonable care for a medical practitioner is judged in the context of the law that applies to the place where the medical practitioner is practicing their profession.Usually, that standard of care is governed by state law, and a failure to provide medical care that is illegal under state law will generally not constitute medical malpractice. In particular, the , 18 U.S.C. 13, makes state law crimes applicable to conduct occurring on lands reserved or acquired by the Federal government as provided in 18 U.S.C. 7(3), when the act or omission is not made punishable by an enactment of Congress, by incorporating those crimes by reference into federal law as federal crimes.So, a state law criminalizing abortion in a state where a federal facility is located would also be a federal crime which would be enforceable by federal prosecutors and would cabin the standard of care for health care in a state, unless the Department of Justice clearly stated an express policy not to enforce that statute. There are nuances to how the Assimilative Crimes Act applies, however, which are discussed at the link and it does not incorporate by reference state regulatory schemes.Thus, while federal medical facilities can be immune to the restrictions of state law pursuant to the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution, in practice, this is usually not the case (at least in substance). So, as a general rule, failing to perform medical services that are illegal in the state where the medical services are provided will not constitute medical malpractice. The federal government, by statute, regulation, or a binding opinion of the Department of Justice, can abrogate state law for the conduct of medical practitioners at a federal facility, but this is the exception rather than the rule.I am not aware of instances of the federal government asserting this authority to authorize abortion procedures at a federal facility, although I acknowledge that I am not all knowing and that there may be some specific case where this has been done of which I am not aware. In part, this hasn't been done, because before Roe v. Wade was overturned by the recent Dobbs decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, it wasn't necessary to do so.The federal government has the power to adopt its own laws regarding the legality of abortion procedures in its own health care facilities that would pre-empt state law. But, by and large, it has not done so. Indeed, in most circumstances there is a ban on using federal funds for health care involving abortion except to save the life of the mother, under . This means that the vast majority of abortion procedures have to be performed outside federal health care facilities (although a more in depth analysis must be undertaken in circumstances like a foreign military base where there are no alternative sources of health care for a patient).The exact parameters of the &quot;health of the mother situation&quot;, the policies of the federal health care facility, the parameters of the state law abortion restrictions, and the nature of the patient's relationship to the facility (inmates are entitled to bring medical malpractice suits only in much more limited circumstances than other patients), would all be relevant in the analysis of whether an FTCA claim for medical malpractice in a case where a physician at a federal health care facility refused to provide abortion services necessary to protect the life of the mother."}

I am just wondering if that might be possible.I understand that soaking publicly on the internet does carry risk, but I was checking whether something that I thought Rose to the level of ethical malice Rose to the level of legal malice. Now, it seems like it doesn't.","answer":"You Have No RecourseYou have no recourse, at least to the extent that the people communicating to your employer point out the particular Facebook posts that were made or accurately summarize or paraphrase them (if the content of the Facebook posts was misrepresented to the employer that would be a different story).A factually truthful statement (e.g., 'McGovern made a Facebook post at this link which you ought to look at') is absolutely privileged from legal liability under the 1st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (assuming that you are talking about a U.S. case).The only exceptions would be when (1) the information provided is false and the person providing the tip has the appropriately standard of intent pending right now), or (2) the person providing the tip was someone who owed you a duty of confidentiality (e.g. your lawyer or psychiatrist), but that duty applies only to confidential communications between you and that person in most cases, and hence not to Facebook posts.Also, whether your own statements on Facebook were true, false or neither (e.g. statements of opinion) is irrelevant to the culpability or liability of the people providing the tip to your employer, so long as their description of your posts made to the employer were substantially accurate or to the extent that they were inaccurate were accompanied by a means by which the employer could determine what you actually said without relying on their second hand account. To the extent that you are not a public figure and this is not a matter of public concern, even a negligent misrepresentation about what you actually wrote on Facebook, that is not a statement of opinion and is not accompanied by a reference allowing someone to confirm the accuracy of the statement at the source, could give rise to legal liability on the part of the person giving the tip. The standard of intent is the higher 'actual malice' threshold for statements on matters of public concern, statements by media defendants and statements about public figures. But, there is nothing in the question to suggest that the tip given was in any way inaccurate.This Does Not Legally Constitute HarassmentThis is not harassment in a legal sense, even if it may have been an unkind thing to do on the part of the person doing it done with a specific and malicious desire on the person providing the tip to harm you. This is a natural consequence of you saying something on the Internet, which is forever. If your employer doesn't like true things that you say whether or not they relate to your job, if you are an employee at will you can be fired for it.It isn't absolutely impossible for factually true statements to constitute harassment, in a legal sense, but in those cases, it is the frequency and character of the communications, rather than their content or intended recipient, that make them harassing. For example, if the person providing the tip sent an email about that tip every five minutes for several days to every email address at your employer, causing your employer to find that it was just too disruptive to the employer's business to keep you on the payroll, that might be harassment, but that would have nothing to do with the content of the message provided in that case. Similarly, if someone screamed and yelled their statement over a loudspeaker every time you tried to tutor someone, that might be harassment, again, without regard to the content of what they were saying. In those cases, the 'time, place and manner' exception to laws limiting the freedom of speech would apply.Could An Employer Take Employment Action Based On These Posts?There are a couple of states (Wyoming and Colorado, at least) which prohibit employers for taking employment actions against employees for lawful off the job conduct, despite the fact that otherwise, the default rule of law is that an employer can normally treat an employee at will (which the vast majority of employees are) as the employer deems fit. But, even then, liability is limited to the employer and not the person providing the tip. And, even in those states, off duty conduct can sometimes be considered by employers when it reflects directly on your fitness and ability to do your job when you are on the job, which a post about mathematics made by a math tutor very well might.Some high level employees with written contracts, career government employees with civil service protections, and almost all unionized employees can only be fired or disciplined on the job when the higher standard of 'for cause' employment action is met, which posting something true on Facebook would not normally be. But, in the 'at will' employment world, anything you say can and will be held against you even if it is entirely true. But, again, even if the employer misuses the information  that the employer receives, that doesn't mean that someone who provided truthful information to your employer has any legal responsibility whatsoever to you or that the person providing the tip has done anything legally wrong in any way.For the most part, even if every word of your Facebook post was 100% true and accurate, outside the couple of states mentioned, you can be fired for posting it anyway if you are an employee at will. For example, suppose that your employer thinks that the Kumon method of teaching mathematics is a horrible method of instruction, and you post Kumon method exercises or explanations on your Facebook page (assume to avoid going on tangents that you had express permission from the copyright holder to do so). You could still be fired by your employer for posting that on Facebook in the vast majority of states.A Footnote on Internet Age Defamation JurisdictionThe usual rule is that a U.S. Defendant can be sued for defamation or similar torts where a statement is intentionally published to by the person being sued. In the case of a media defendant, or someone suing over a post made on Facebook, that could be any place in the world in many cases.But, while the geographic location of your Facebook post may be unclear, the geographic location of your employer to whom the statement you are concerned about being communicated was made, is not. Any harm done to you was done by communications to a single 'legal' person who is legally located at a particular place in a single state, so the law of the state in which your employer is located (Washington State, U.S.A.) would govern, although there would also be an argument to looking to the law of the place where the person making the statement was located when they made the statement (which, it appears, would also be Washington State in your fact pattern).When someone in the U.S. communicates something to someone outside the U.S. that does not have the same level of protections for free speech that the U.S. does, there are federal statutes that provide that a judgment obtained there is not enforceable in the United States."}
{"question":"A general contractor is putting up a large office building for a customer. A sub-contractor is hired to install the dry wall and office doors. The work is essentially complete. More than 90 days has gone by and the sub-contractor has not been paid. The general contractor is close to handing title of the building to the customer.The credit manager of the sub-contractor is unhappy that his firm has not be yet paid. Hewould like to put a lien on the building but 90 days have passed since the work has stopped. He then notices that one of the terms of the contract says that the sub-contractor must deliver a garbage can for the lobby and his firm has failed to do so. So he buys a garbage can and delivers it to the new building. He then places a lien on the building.The general contractor's lawyer says that the lien is invalid because more than 90 days have passed. The credit manager says it is because the work was not complete until the garbage can was delivered. Who is right?","answer":"The garbage can probably wouldn't work because it isn't a fixture or part of the property. But the bigger question doesn't have a general answer and has to be determined on a case by case basis by a judge interpreting the language of the mechanic's lien statute in light of experience and the evidence presented.There are certainly cases where a subcontractor could do some work on a contract, pause work, and then do some more work on the contract, in order to benefit from the later &quot;last work done&quot; for mechanic's lien filing purposes.The pertinent New Jersey Statute is . The statutory section establishing the deadline states, with bolded language limiting the kind of conduct contemplated in the question:2A:44A-6.    Filing lien claimA lien claim shall be signed, acknowledged and verified by oath of the claimant or, in the case of a partnership or corporation,a partner or duly authorized officer thereof, and filed with thecounty clerk not later than 90 days following the date the last work,services, material or equipment was provided for which payment isclaimed.  No lien shall attach, or be enforceable under the provisionsof this act and, in the case of a residential construction contract,compliance with sections 20 and 21 of this act, unless the lien claimis filed in the form, manner and within the time provided by thissection and section 8 of this act, and a copy thereof served on theowner and, if any, the contractor and the subcontractor, against whomthe claim is asserted, pursuant to section 7 of this act.For purposes of this act, warranty or other service calls, orother work, materials or equipment provided after completion ortermination of a claimant's contract shall not be used to determinethe last day that work, services, material or equipment wasprovided."}
{"question":"I like the idea that businesses can specifically hire homeless people who need it, but what I'm not quite sure of is how businesses are able to do that on an arbitrary basis, because as far as I know they are supposed to make the position publicly available and conduct interviews for any applicants.  ","answer":"You don't specify a jurisdiction, so this answer will be as general as possible, but specify jurisdictions for examples.You are under two misconceptions:1) The arbitrary selection (hereafter referred to as 'discrimination') is illegal in general.2) A position is required to be publicly announcedDiscriminationAs a general rule, discrimination is legal, acceptable, and in some cases required; however, many places forbid discrimination on specific attributes. For example, US law forbids discrimination on sex, race, religion, and national origin,  among other things, barring a specific demonstrable need; all forms of discrimination that are not forbidden by law are allowable. For example, my department has the following legal discriminatory biases: a bias against those who lack university degrees, a bias in favor of a specific local university (which about half my department graduated from), and a bias for our own membership (e.g. promoting from within).Open job postingsAs a general rule, a company is not required to publicly announce positions. Governments are often required to, sometimes by their own rules, but this is to protect against corruption and cronyism, rather than an absolute. For example, there is not a public posting for, say, US Supreme Court Justices or Cabinet Secretaries.Larger corporations, especially publicly traded ones, often adopt similar rules, to protect the company and shareholders from internal corruption (e.g. a manager hiring a friend to a position that they are not qualified for, or receiving a kickback bribe for their hiring decision), but they are not required to unless a specific law or program they are enrolled into requires them to do so. For example, some Federal Contractors are required to post their positions publicly, as a condition of their contracts.So, in summary, there is no reason why a business cannot arbitrarily hire a homeless person specifically for being homeless, unless a) homelessness becomes a legally protected category, or b) a specific rule or government contract provision requires public posting of open positions."}
{"question":"In Arizona, Common Law Marriage is not recognized.  I heard if a couple has a common law marriage and has kids, if the man dies without a will, the kids\/wife don't end up inheriting his possessions.  If both the parents died, the kids would be left to the state to take care of.  Is this true?  I did not find this situation explained in my Google searches.","answer":" appears to have a good explanation. The probate court will have to confirm that the children are yours before they can inherit. Your children would inherit any separately held assets that don't have a beneficiary associated with them.You should make sure your spouse (or kids) are the beneficiaries on any retirement accounts, bank accounts, life insurance, etc. Those won't go into probate and will be inherited directly. If your minor children are the beneficiaries, then the court will have to appoint someone to manage the money for them. That will likely be their mother\/other parent, but the court would have to appoint that person.For jointly held assets, that don't have a beneficiary, your common law spouse would inherit half the asset, your children would inherit the other half. Property depends on the deed whether it's held as joint tenants or tenants in common."}
{"question":"Say you are offered investments that look like regular mutual fund investments.You ask how much money is invested.The sales people say, all funds are invested.You read the contract and found nothing suspicious.Turns out, you overlooked a verse in the 20 page contract that states that 50-70% of the money goes to pay the agent commission; only partially % is invested. The very important term is well hidden within those 20 pages.You confront the sales people and they say that all of the money is invested. If you let the investment grow, in 1000 years you'll get your money back if the market is good. So the whole thing is 'long term investment'.Is this fraud?What does the law says in say Indonesia, USA, or anything?NB: If it's a fraud, is this a crime or still just purely civil matter?Update: In Indonesia many insurance companies charge high acquisition costs. So 100% of premi is gone to pay for the acquisition costs. Actually the total amount gone is about 230% of yearly premi.Things get interesting because in some companies, even when the insurance benefit only worth $10, an agent can set premi to be very high (thousands of dollars or even more) and claim that all money are 'invested'.So basically customers put $5k on 'investment'. Agent says 'all are invested.' Customer thinking that all are invested put huge money only to see all those money are gone for fees.Customers gotNothing. All money are gone for acquisition fee. About 50% is to pay insurance agent.Insurance protection worth $10.An option to 'continue' the 'investment' where customers will lost even more money for insignificant insurance cost.Basically customer miss the part where it says that 100% of premiums are gone for acquisition fees. It's written in contract but quite well hidden among terms that's not important due to low insurance portion of the arrangement (like how to file a claim).Note: If you said that this is fraud in your own jurisdiction, please tell what exact laws\/court case a person can use to sue the agent or companies. In Indonesia, for example, there is law that customer have right to get information that is honest, clear, and correct. However, the company can says that the information is there in the middle of the contract that the customer have agreed. The company can also says that they have paid agent to 'explain' the contract to customers and if anything goes wrong, it's 'agent's' fault.Basically this question relates to Basically the customer miss some important term of the contract. However, the contract is written in such a way that most people would miss those terms.","answer":"It might or it might not be fraud. The outcome will depend on how the facts and evidence are interpreted at trial.A more general version of this question is:  If two parties discuss and orally agree to X; then sign a contract that states they agree to Y, what are the parties bound to? X? Y? Or something else?In your version, X is a fraudulent statement. And Y is an obfuscated writing.One party will argue fraud. The other will argue not fraud on the basis that all the facts were disclosed in writing. The party alleging fraud will carry the burden of proof. The standard of proof will be preponderance of evidence (more than 50%).Generally speaking, written evidence outweighs oral evidence if not accompanied by substantiating facts. Substantiating facts could be:emails orother written correspondence,a prior history or pattern of making false claims to others regarding this investment,the respective behavior of the parties after the agreement was madeor anything else that corroborates the oral testimony presented at trial."}
{"question":"In Star Trek (not the best guide to law), a Starfleet Board of Inquiry equivalent is shown with the presiding officer striking a tiny bell to indicate that proceedings were commencing or adjourned (like an American, though not English, civilian judge might use a gavel).Have Boards of Inquiry or courts martial in either the US Navy or the Royal Navy (the inspirations for Starfleet) ever used such bells, and do they use them today? (Also, if these bells are real, do they have a name?)","answer":"In the Royal Navy, the current mandated ceremony is:On the day on which a court-martial is to sit, the Union Flag is to be hoisted at the peakor at the yardarm as appropriate and a gun is to be fired when colours are hoisted, or at thetime the signal is made if the court is ordered to sit immediately.The Union Flag is to be dipped between each separate court.Should the court sit for more than one day, the Union Flag is to be hoisted and a gunfired each day when colours are hoistedor at any time previously that the court may resumeits sitting. The Union Flag is to be hauled down when the court adjourns for the day.Where local conditions dictate that that the firing of a gun be inappropriate it may beomitted with the permission of the local senior officer.This is paragraph 9143 of , which says in its courts-martial chapter:IX. When Sentence of Death is to be executed upon any Criminal, Notice is to be first given from the Ship by a Signal, and firing a Gun; upon which, the Captains of all the Ships present shall summon their companies upon Deck, to be Spectators thereof, and shall make known to them the Crime, for which the Punishment is inflicted.Firing the gun is commonly known as the &quot;rogue's salute&quot;. Capital punishment is no longer used in the armed forces, but perhaps some relic of it has survived in the flag-and-gun ceremonial, translated from sentencing to the start of proceedings. In practice, the gun is unlikely to be used these days, since courts martial typically take place in fixed establishments. The centre in Bulford is right next to housing and so those &quot;local conditions&quot; apply.Royal Navy ships absolutely do have bells, which are used ceremonially. Since former regulations called for courts martial to be held in the most &quot;publick Place of the Ship&quot; (paragraph III of the 1731 text), that could mean on deck near the bell, and one could imagine a ceremonial strike of that bell to get everyone's attention. But I don't know if that was actual practice at the time. The miniature bell in the picture is too small to be a real ship's bell, but perhaps it creates an aura of Navy-ness.Military judges in the UK (Navy or otherwise) do not use gavels, just like in civilian courts. They use their voices when it's time to declare something."}
{"question":"In a Civil Case Complaint against the US Federal Government, it is possible for the plaintiff in certain circumstances to get a refund of his attorney fees and other expenses.As explained on a :The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), first enacted in 1980,authorizes the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligibleparties who prevail against the Federal government in judicialproceedings and certain adversarial agency adjudicative proceedings,where the position of the government is not substantially justified.In a Civil Cover Sheet (JS44) that accompanies Civil Case Complaints, there is usually a field called \"Demand $\" in which the plaintiff should specify if the complaint demandsany amount of money as part of the requested relief.Question: Is this field also intended for specifying a requested refund of legal fees (based on the EAJA), in case that the plaintiff will be a prevailing party?Pay attention that the question refers to the initial complaint and its corresponding cover sheet which are being filed (as opposed to a potential subsequent separate complaint, specifically for the purpose of requesting an EAJA refund). Therefore at the time of filing, it is not yet known if the plaintiff will be a prevailing party. However it is possible to specify even in the initial complaint itself that part of the requested relief is a refund of legal fees according to the EAJA. So the question is if the \"Demand $\" field in the cover sheet for the initial complaint is intended also to specify this type of monetary compensation.","answer":"Is this field also intended for specifying a requestedrefund of legal fees (based on the EAJA), in case that the plaintiffwill be a prevailing party?No."}
{"question":"This morning, on Law Stack exchange there was an item by someone which included the following comment: A police officer detains you by issuing a command of some sort. For  example, 'Stop, stay here.' If a citizen issues you the same command,  and a 'reasonable person' would consider it backed up with the same  threat of force as that implied by the police, then the citizen has  committed assault. If the citizen has merely obstructed your path  without threatening you then they have definitely not committed  assault.Source: Firstly, is this true in the United States? Secondly, is it true in the UK?I found this interesting summary but I don't think it quite covers the statement above. At common law, an 'assault' consists of placing someone in fear of an unwanted touchingSource: Would, for example, a stranger shouting demands at you in order to attempt to obtain compliance with those demands count as assault within the UK?","answer":"Yes, in both the U.K. and U.S. assault is a crime, though in many jurisdictions it is only a summary offence in its common form.The key element of assault is the creation of an apprehension of immediate use of unlawful violence against the victim by the perpetrator.So, for example, if an unarmed person on the other side of an insurmountable barricade shouts threats of immediate violence, they cannot be guilty of assault.  (Though they may be guilty of terroristic threats, disturbing the peace, etc.).However, if a looming person says, 'Stop, or else,' and a reasonable person would interpret that as threat of imminent battery for failure to comply with the unlawful demand, then that meets the standard definition of assault."}
{"question":"Is it possible for a statement to retroactively become perjurious based on future actions?Suppose:I'm sworn in under oath (testifying in court, before congress, etc.)I make a specific promise, e.g.:\"I will go there at the end of the month\"\"I will direct my company to stop this practice immediately\"\"I will pay $1,000 within two weeks\"When the time comes, I do not do it.Is that perjury? How about with one or both of these additional factors (assume sufficient evidence):I am fully capable of fulfilling my pledge but choose not to.I did not intend to fulfill my pledge at the time I made it.","answer":"No because &quot;under oath&quot; can never apply to promises. &quot;Under oath&quot; is limited to legally specified statements of fact, such as testimony given in a trial or written declarations legally given to a party empowered to receive &quot;sworn statements&quot; (e.g. DMCA takedown notices have to include the &quot;penalty of perjury&quot; language). Two parties cannot arbitrarily declare that a certain statement is &quot;under oath&quot;, only the legislature of courts can impose that condition on a statement&quot;.A promise is not a statement of &quot;fact as the person knows it&quot;. Perjury is where you make a statement that you know to be untrue (&quot;I saw Smith take the knife&quot;) and cannot apply to a future event (under current technology). Under some conditions, a promise could constitute a binding contract which can be enforced, whereas perjury is a crime for which there are penalties. The assessment of whether a statement is perjurous is based on whether the person knew that the statement was false when he made the statement. It could constitute fraud of a person makes a promise, knowing at the time that he would not keep the promise."}

Rural Telephone Service Co., .IF you take only the facts and not the expression, then the news site can do nothing: you do not violate copyright by taking only the facts. Or as Scotus said in Feist:As a statutory matter,  does not afford protection from copying to a collection of facts that are selected, coordinated, and arranged in a way that utterly lacks originality.News contain more than facts.However, do note that news are not mere facts - like a phonebook as the Feist case was - but have their facts intricately entwined with expression. That's why press agencies like Reuters work: They get informed of facts, write an article and news sites buy that article's expression to refine it into their style. Most newspapers buy these articles, which leads to the appearance of nigh simultaneously reporting on the same event.To understand where the line is between fact and expression, compare the following headlines from , all regarding the same event: titled their front page: Erm?chtigungsgesetz mit 441 gegen 94 Stimmen angenommen (Enabeling Act approved with 441 to 94 votes) - That is merely reporting facts. titled the front page: Ein Neues Zeitalter (A new Age) - This is an expression of opinion - and thus protected.New York Times titled, deep inside, in the category Special Cable:  - That is a fact."}
{"question":"I live in a two party consent state. I would like to record talks in work to defend myself from certain situations. I explained my intention to my boss and he said its perfectly fine. However sometimes my boss calls me to his table and not an empty room, so if I record such conversation other people talking could also make their way into the recordings. In this case do I need to ask every other employee in the room and get their explicit consent? Or is the approval of my boss enough regardless of 3rd parties in the background?","answer":"If a party is aware that you are recording and they continue to be a party to the communication, they have implicitly consented.Their leverage is that they can stop talking, not that they can absolutely stop you from recording. Physical location is not the determining factor so &quot;being in the same room&quot; is not the determinative factor. Instead, the question is whether the person is a party to the communication (not just &quot;sitting nearby&quot;). Implicit consent is widely recognized, see for Washington (one of the all-party consent states) , 129 Wn.2d 211).Consent (implicit or explicit) has to come from each party to each communication that you record. That means, first, that the boss cannot issue a blanket consent for all employees. Second, it means that you can only record the communication between you and your boss, and not separate communications between A and B, from whose perspective the recording is secret (therefore illegal). Whether or not recording in a room with two conversations taking place is a very fact-intensive question regarding the effectiveness of your public announcement, the physical nature of the other communications (sound pressure level), and your recording apparatus."}
{"question":"I'm a contractor and have come to familiarise myself with the standard wording that comes with most NDAs. I perform contract programming work for companies overseas and access their IP to perform my services (bug fixes, feature adds, etc).However, I'm not 100% clear on the interpretation of a the following section.Purpose. In furtherance of the purpose or purposes stated below, the Company may disclose its Confidential Information to Recipient.  This Agreement is intended to bind Recipient and prevent it from  disclosing the Confidential Information as herein provided or from  using the Confidential Information for purposes other than considering  whether to enter into a contractual business relationship, including  but not limited to a potential investment transaction (the Permitted  Purpose).Usually, the purpose is much wider than this. It'll include things like offering my services, or performing designated tasks. From my interpretation above, I'm only allowed to use their IP for 'considering whether to enter into a contractual business relationship', which doesn't seem to fit the end goal of my services at all. If I sign this, I still don't have access to their IP to offer my services.The 'including but not limited to a potential investment transaction' doesn't seem to apply to me, because I'm not an investor. It seems like this NDA is more likely designed to be signed by potential investors than contractors.Especially since later on in the contract,Recipient further agrees not to use the Confidential Information  provided to it by the Company for any purposes other than the  Permitted Purpose.Naturally, I'm going to bring this up with the client before I sign, but I thought I'd also enquire here. My question is as follows:Is my interpretation of this wording correct, or is there scope within this wording that does allow for my services within the Permitted Purpose?If it's relevant, this contract was supplied by a company based in California, USA.","answer":"That wording is designed for the case where Recipient (potential contractor) considers but does not thereafter sign contract for the actual work.If you decide to work for them, the contract for services will have its own non-disclosure provisions and the NDA will be superseded \/ not relevant anymore."}
{"question":"I was wondering how binding my websites Terms and Conditions are.I specify a few things there, including a return policy and terms of use.I am in California. I'm starting to sell to the U.S. and then Canada, and then the whole EU.","answer":"Your terms and conditions must comply with the laws in:Your jurisdiction (California)Your customer's jurisdiction (each of the US states, Canadian provinces and ultimately countries and sub-jurisdictions in Europe)If they do they will generally be enforceable; if they don't then they will not be enforceable and you may be exposing yourself to civil and criminal sanctions. While not immediately relevant to you, Australian Consumer Law has such sanctions to goods sold into Australia from anywhere in the world; I am not familiar with other jurisdictions.With respect to your comment that you will not accept returns or refunds, this would expose you to potential fines in Australia of $220,000 for an individual or $1,100,000 for a corporation - under  returns and refunds are a consumer right. I strongly suspect that most of the jurisdictions you are selling into would take a similar position.A general 'catch-all' like 'to the extent permitted by law' may reduce the risk of being prosecuted but it would not eliminate it entirely. Again, in Australia, the provision is that you must not engage in deceptive and misleading conduct - merely suggesting that you will not give a refund even with the limitation above - may still be deemed 'deceptive and misleading' if the court feels that a reasonable consumer might assume that they are not entitled to a refund.You need professional legal advice on this."}

Law enforcement might be broken into two cases. (1) federal law enforcement to include: \"Border Patrol,\"FBI\", Drug Enforcement Agency, and U.S. Marshals.

There have been allegations that doctors or EMTs have done so at the suggestion of police, see  (an EMT administered ketamine to a detainee in the back of a police car under the orders of a doctor). The court addresses the legal issues in 3(b), mostly disposing of plaintiff's inapplicable legal arguments. The court does not that liability could arise if an officer knowingly makes a false report to medical authorities about a detainees behavior. In this case, police also assisted in the injection by restraining the detainee, but the court finds that officers have some obligation to assist medical personnel in this way."}
{"question":"John C. Eastman, professor of law, Chapman University,  a few days ago:Indeed, the Supreme Court has never held that anyone born on U.S. soil, no matter the circumstances of the parents, is automatically a U.S. citizen.Granted, our government's view of the Constitution's citizenship mandate has morphed over the decades to what is now an absolute \"birth on the soil no matter the circumstances\" viewbut that morphing does not appear to have begun until the late 1960s, after Kamala Harris' birth in 1964.Some other legal scholars previously expressed similar opinions. Matthew Spalding, of Hillsdale College :Even when the justices expanded the constitutional mandate U.S. v.Wong Kim Ark (1898), the decision cited as establishing birthrightcitizenship, they held only that the children of legal permanentresidents were automatically citizens. The high court has never heldthat the clause confers automatic citizenship on the children oftemporary visitors, much less of aliens in the country illegally.Will Kamala Harris's vice-presidential run force SCOTUS to make a decision about birthright citizenship before the election?Edit: I'd like to emphasize that this question is not about how the Citizenship Clause should be interpreted (which is discussed in a , as @phoog pointed out, and in Prof. Eastman's article itself), but whether SCOTUS can be expected to opine on it, in light of recent controversies.","answer":"Probably not, because there is no legal case or controversy, and the law is clear enough.

Harris's parents were not immune diplomats so she was never immune to US jurisdiction.They are never forced to take any case, and are especially not likely to take a case so lacking in legal merits."}
{"question":"According to Oxford Languages,sign (a check or bill of exchange) on the back to make it payable tosomeone other than the stated payee or to accept responsibility forpaying it.I'm having trouble understanding the bolded part. \"sign (a check or bill of exchange) on the back to make it payable to someone other than the stated payee\" is clear. This basically means that if my father is the stated payee on the cheque, and he endorses the cheque using my name, then I will be able to encash the cheque as well. However, what does \"to accept responsibility for paying it\" mean?","answer":"One kind of negotiable instrument which illustrates the point most familiarly is a negotiable promissory note.If you sign a promissory note even if the loan is made to someone else, i.e. if you endorse the promissory note, by doing so, you accept responsibility for paying it.The language in the sentence breaks out:sign (a check or bill of exchange) on the back[a] to make it payable to someone other than the stated payee or[b] to accept responsibility for paying it.There are two different purposes for which you could endorse the instrument. One is the change the payee and another is to change the payor.The language is somewhat awkward, because usually when you sign to accept responsibility for paying it, you sign on the front and not the back.For example, if your bank &quot;certifies&quot; your personal check, it is basically co-signing the promise to pay the payee that you made by signing the check."}

{"question":"Let's say you are eating dinner with your family at a restaurant in Florida that has some outside seating. In the middle of your meal, a young man proceeds to try to sell you his mix tape. You politely decline, and go back to your meal. He is very persistent and borderline aggressive with his sales pitch. At which point you are slightly less polite and tell him to buzz off. He takes offense to the manner in which you responded and proceeds to take off his shirt and takes a very threatening stance. You believe that the safety of your family may be in danger. As you get up from your seat, the young man takes a swing at you which you are able to dodge. And you proceed to give him a good one-two combination which subsequently knocks him down. He is clearly dazed. But gets up and wants to continue the fight. You aggressively pick him up, slam him to the ground, give him 2 good punches to the face, and he's knocked out. At which point you back off as you feel you have sufficiently neutralized the threat to your family. Police arrive and start to question witnesses, request a copy of the security cam footage and question you. All of which match up showing that the confrontation was started by the young man walking up to you having dinner. Did I have a legal right to defend myself and family?Will I face criminal charges for injuring the young man?If the individual sustains injuries, can I be liable for his medical expenses?If during the fight, damage occurred to the restaurant or other private\/public property. Could I be liable for those expenses?","answer":"In Florida, as in most common-law jurisdictions, you may legally use force to defend yourself and others from someone else's imminent physical assault. Florida makes it explicit.  ?Use or threatened use of force in defense of person.  (1)?A person is justified in using or threatening to use force, except  deadly force, against another when and to the extent that the person  reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself  or herself or another against the other's imminent use of unlawful force.  A person who uses or threatens to use force in accordance with this  subsection does not have a duty to retreat before using or threatening  to use such force.The force you're defending against must be imminent, though.You can't just believeyou may be in danger; you have to believe you are. Further, you mustreasonably believe not only that use of force is necessary to defendagainst that danger, but also that you have to use that much force.Once you believe any of those statements to be false, or any of thosebeliefs become unreasonable, you're no longer protected by 776.012. If you continue to use force past that point, you're no longer defending; you're attacking.Yes, there may be criminal charges. I mean, use of force is illegal bydefault, and justified or not, you did just knock a guy out. Thegovernment has a duty to ensure that your use of force was lawful, andif it finds reason to believe otherwise, you may be charged.Yes, you might be held liable for the attacker's medical expenses.Mix Tape Guy is likely to try to sue in any case. He has some smallchance of winning, partly because civil and criminal trials presentdifferent burdens of proof. If you weren't charged, or were found notguilty (and didn't get off on a technicality), then that chance remainspretty small. But if you are tried andfound guilty of assault, you're much more likely to lose.Yes, you might be held liable for damage to the restaurant etc.Same story as with Mix Tape Guy. The outcome will depend heavily on theoutcome of the criminal trial. If you weren't charged, or you were foundnot guilty, then you're less likely to have to pay to fix the restaurant.If you're tried and found guilty, you'll almost certainly have to chip in."}
{"question":"Is any part of the Magna Carta currently considered valid US law?","answer":"The Magna Carta acted as an origin of many legal concepts of today, includng the English, and thus US, common law system.  It clearly affected the Founders' views of government and was instrumental in creation of the US constitution.But no provision of the Magna Carta would be considered on its own to be valid US law."}
{"question":"If there was a food or chemical substance that was not listed as a controlled substance either federally or at the state level, and it is never explicitly mentioned in any FDA food guidelines, does that mean that it can be included in food and sold to consumers without any special labeling? What laws regulate whether a chemical substance or plant product can be included in food when it is not explicitly banned or regulated by the FDA, assuming it isn't harmful at amounts present in a normal serving?What if that substance has potentially harmful effects when taken in much larger amounts than included in a standard serving of the food product? (For instance, caffeine is legal to sell without warning labels, but in excessive doses can result in hospitalization or death). If a product is safe in the suggested serving size, are food processors liable for harm caused when people abuse their products and consume excessive amounts of them?","answer":"The FDA maintains a list of substances &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot; and provides that list on their web site at:To quote their site:Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the Act, and FDA's implementingregulations in 21 CFR 170.3 and 21 CFR 170.30, the use of a foodsubstance may be GRAS either through scientific procedures or, for asubstance used in food before 1958, through experience based on commonuse in food Under 21 CFR 170.30(b), general recognition of safetythrough scientific procedures requires the same quantity and qualityof scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of thesubstance as a food additive.

{"question":"Denver International Airport (DEN) has a number of smoking lounges, something I've never seen in any other airport anywhere in the States.Are those lounges allowed to sell cannabis, since it's now all legal in Colorado?","answer":"No, they are not.  The airport is supposedly under federal jurisdiction (according to a DEN employee), and the federal government does not allow such sales to take place.  Thus, all smoking lounges in DEN are cannabis-free.Apparently, according to an employee within DEN, some people do manage to get past the security and into those lounges with their own pot, but, they're not allowed to keep at it, either."}
{"question":"Long story short:I live in Washington DC (South American country citizen, Green Card now).I started the process to get H1b Visa (March-2016, I know, long ago) with a company in Houston, TX. In order to start the process, I made one payment to them $1500 (March-2016, and later $2500 in May-2016, after I was 'accepted', to follow the process) and fill out many forms (a contract included) with some important information about me (SSN, DOB, address, etc.).They gave me an 'EAC' case number with USCIS, everything looked good.It supposed I was accepted in the draw process (USCIS never gave me any information, they said only can do it to the company) in April-2016.One of the many problems here is, the person whom I transferred the money is not anymore in the company (I do have the two bank receipts, though). Last time I talked to him, he told me that I should talk to company, not him, and after Harvey, the company had lot of problems, he was not sure if the company had disappeared (likely he was lying).I have sent hundreds of email and made hundreds of phone calls for months, NEVER answered.I know, VERY likely it IS a scam, but...

An H1B visa is what a company applies for so they can hire a non-citizen to legally work in the US. Any requirement by you to pay for one is a clear scam especially since it doesn't sound like you were applying to work for this 'company'. And as a Green Card holder, you are eligible to work in the US and don't need a H1B visa in the first place.

{"question":"I am currently involved in a discussion in some Internet forum. One aspect of this discussion is the question if the following situation is punishable (or a crime) in at least one US state:There is some web site that offers some products sold by other persons or companies (you might think of Amazon or eBay). The web site operator takes a percentage of the price of the service as sales commission.A vendor officially offers some expensive product (e.g. $1000) for a very low price (e.g. $20), but the product cannot be used without some \"additional\" service which is sold separately for a high price (e.g. $950) although it is actually worth nearly nothing.The customer knows this and is happy because he must only pay $950 + $20 = $970 instead of $1000. The vendor saves a lot of sales provision because he officially sold the product for $20 instead of $1000.The operator of the web site looses a lot of money because the vendor does not pay the \"full\" sales provision.The question is:Is the vendor liable to prosecution in some US state?","answer":"Yes, it's a crimeSpecifically fraud, the  is (me emphasis):(1) A person who, by any deception, dishonestly--(a) obtains property belonging to another, or(b) obtains any financial advantage or causes any financial disadvantage,is guilty of the offence of fraud.However, this is unlikely to be prosecuted by the state. Police would probably see this as a breach of contract matter to be resolved civilly between the platform and the vendor."}
{"question":"It seems most laws regarding marijuana have varying consequences based on the quantity\/weight.  How does this apply to extracts such as THC and CBD oils, edibles, etc? Is it based on the weight of the extracts or the rough equivalent weight of marijuana?","answer":"Starting with federal law, under , there are 4 levels of trafficking weight for marijuana, the most severe being  1000 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a  detectable amount of marihuana, or 1,000 or more marihuana plants  regardless of weight doesn't distinguish what the substance is or what the weight is (because trafficking laws make those distinctions).In Washington, marijuana possession is legal up to certain limits. Under , these limits are:  (a) One ounce of useable marijuana;    (b) Sixteen ounces of marijuana-infused product in solid form;    (c) Seventy-two ounces of marijuana-infused product in liquid form; or    (d) Seven grams of marijuana concentrateThe underlying theory is that these are equivalent in terms of their effects. The state regulates growth and manufacturing under  by rules such as the one that 'A single serving of a marijuana-infused product must not exceed ten milligrams active tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), or Delta 9'.The general pattern is that in laws saying that marijuana is legal, there is no attempt to reduce weight limits to a constant factor such as 'amount of THC', but in (state) laws allowing marijuana, an effort is made to recognize that hash oil and leaves are not functionally equivalent."}
{"question":"My understanding is that most crimes that don't involve the US as a party, maritime law, special cases, etc, are handled by state courts, where the rules differ from state to state. But in certain circumstances these ordinary crimes can become federal cases. Yet the Constitution says nothing about crimes committed by citizens. So when were these rules established?I'm looking at murder as a particular case of interest. If murder isn't forbidden by the Constitution, when were federal laws first established on how to handle it?","answer":"On April 30, 1790 (during the 1st Congress) a statute was passed (, pp. 112-113 of the entire acts), the third section of which reads  ...And be it [further]enacted, That if any person or persons shall,  within any fort, arsenal, dock-yard, magazine, or in any other place  or district of country, under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of  the United States, commit the crime of wilful murder, such person or  persons on being thereof convicted shall suffer death(and then there are numerous other sections criminalizing murder in federal jurisdiction)."}
{"question":"In the US state of California, if someone feels an existing law gives excessive punishments or is unconstitutional, what can they do?","answer":"One approach is to sue the (state) government, to see if the state or US Supreme Courts agree. This is probably the most complicated way to get what you want, because it involves a lot of legal arguing, but you don't need a lot of people to agree with you, you just need the right people agreeing with you. Another approach is to change the relevant state statute (repeal, reword, add another); or, you could change the state's Constitution. Changes could either come via the legislature, or via the people. The role of the people, in the case of a legislative change, is to politically persuade the government to do what you want.Via , Prop 12 (2018), which passed. Instead of collecting signatures, one can persuade a majority of the legislature, but this still requires voter approval.The easiest path for changing the law is for the people to persuade the legislature, because the legislature has the power to change \/ add laws. Even then, some legislative acts have to also be submitted to popular vote for (dis)approval, either bond measures or amendments to previous voter initiatives."}
{"question":"A website that I visited posted the following: YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO US. New regulations in your country require you to agree to our terms of use agreement and privacy policy before you can continue using this websiteThe first sentence is an obvious lie (they only care about my data, not my privacy). But I would have thought GDPR required them to respect my privacy, not deny access. Is what they are doing (only allowing access in exchange for giving up privacy rights) legal under GDPR?","answer":"No, it is not legal.Regardless of their location, the only legal options for companies serving to EU residents are to either deny access altogether or to make consent truly optional<sup>1<\/sup> states (emphasis mine):  Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement[...] states:  Consent is presumed not to be freely given [...] or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance.\/><sup>1<\/sup> Of course, remember that consent is only one of several means that allow them to process data.For example, if you were getting a trial account for a limited time, it would be considered a legitimate business need to ensure that you are not just opening new trial accounts when the old ones expire.

{"question":"In the United States, could a Caucasian identify as an African American without any legal repercussions? It seems that it is currently legal to identify as genders other than your genetic one. Is it legal to do this with race?For example, if there was a scholarship for a particular race could someone not of that race identify as that race, apply for the scholarship, win the scholarship, and be able to collect with protection of the law?Can't think of a better example at the moment, but just curious how race works according to the law. If we don't know because it has never hit the courts, that's fine.P.S. This is just curiosity. I am not planning anything.","answer":"It is generally though not absolutely illegal to use race as a basis for doing things. A private organization can, however, currently use whatever criteria it wishes, to decide who to give its scholarships to:  has a list of about 25. Then the question is whether a demographic claim could be fraudulent (hence legally actionable). (There is a separate question regarding a school having a role in racially-restricted scholarships because there would be problems if the school gets any federal money or claims tax-except status, or engages in something that might be considered to affect interstate commerce, so let's assume that the flow of money is directly from the organization to the recipient).There have been a handful of cases where a university faculty member has alleged a certain ethnic connection, which has been questioned, but as far as I know nobody has been fired for claiming an ethnicity that they aren't entitled to. There are two reasons. First, a university can't make race be a criterion for employment, so any putative fraud would not be material. Second, there is generally no objective proof of the falsity of such a claim (except: claiming to be a member of a particular tribe is a provable matter of fact \u2013 look on the tribal register).In the past, when interracial marriage was illegal (and similar laws), it was necessary to legally define races, such as the Virginia , which ask of the 'category with which you primarily identify'."}
{"question":"If a police officer was in pursuit of someone else's car, with their lights and siren on and there was a second police car following the first police car, but they did not have his\/her lights, or siren on, and the second police car hits your car (from behind). Are the police responsible for the damages? ","answer":"Under those circumstances, probably.Under , an emergency vehicle which is exceeding the speed limit must generally use the lights and siren. There are some exceptions to this; however, given that they generally involve concealing the officer's presence, it seems unlikely that they could apply to the second car if the first is announcing its presence. And even if those exceptions apply:  The exemptions granted the operator of an authorized emergency vehicle by this section do not relieve such operator from the duty to drive or ride with due regard under the circumstances for the safety of all persons nor do they protect such operator from the consequences of his or her reckless disregard for the safety of others.  published in the Marquette Law Review is interesting. According to one footnote:  <ol start='15'>  The duty of care owed by a driver of an emergency police vehicle may vary according to jurisdiction, but the underlying principles of negligence are the same from state to state. In general, the driver of a police vehicle during an emergency situation must 'exercise the care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise in the discharge of official duties of a like nature under the circumstances.' 7A AM. JUR. 2D Automobiles and Highway Traffic 418 (1980).  The paper notes that police have their own guidelines as to how to conduct chases, and that if those guidelines are not followed, juries will often find liability. But, as the paper also notes, 'under the circumstances' means that the facts of each individual case must be examined.  In this case, hitting someone from behind with a car that didn't have its lights and sirens seems bad for the officer. On the other hand, perhaps the person who got hit didn't pull over as required by law or swerved in front of the second car; that would weaken the person's case. In the end a jury would decide."}
{"question":"In my knowledge, rules may only be amended through special procedures governed by the Administrative Procedure Act. This process usually requires advance notice and a period for public comment on proposed rule amendments.

{"question":"From reading the constitution, it appears that regulation of radio is outside the scope of Congress's powers, and should therefore be determined by states. Why is radio federally regulated?","answer":"Commerce ClauseUS Constitution Article I Section 8:The Congress shall have power [...] To regulate commerce [...] among the several states [...]This was explicitly used as the justification for federal regulation of radio, going all the way back to the :Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the UnitedStates of America in Congress assembled, That a person, company, orcorporation within the jurisdiction of the United States shall notuse or operate any apparatus for radio communication as a means ofcommercial intercourse among the several States, or with foreignnations, or upon any vessel of the United States engaged in interstateor foreign commerce, or for the transmission of radiograms or signalsthe effect of which extends beyond the jurisdiction of the State orTerritory in which the same are made, or where interference wouldbe caused thereby with the receipt of messages or signals from beyondthe jurisdiction of the said State or Territory, except under and inaccordance with a license, revocable for cause, in that behalf grantedby the Secretary of Commerce and Labor upon application therefor ;Nearly every meaningful radio transmission has an effect that extends beyond state lines, so this covers practically everything.This has been upheld by the Supreme Court:: &quot;No question is presented as to the power of the Congress, in its regulation of interstate commerce, to regulate radio communications. No state lines divide the radio waves, and national regulation is not only appropriate, but essential, to the efficient use of radio facilities.&quot;: &quot;By its very nature, broadcasting transcends state lines, and is national in its scope and importance -- characteristics which bring it within the purpose and protection, and subject it to the control, of the commerce clause.&quot;As a general rule, any time you wonder why the federal government is allowed to regulate something that isn't explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, nine times out of ten the answer will be &quot;Commerce Clause&quot;."}
{"question":"The next US census is scheduled for 2020-04-01. In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic it might become necessary to delay this. How can this legally be done (since the census is required by the constitution)?","answer":"The date of the census is not specified in the US constitution.  It only says  The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.There is no requirement that 'ten years' be interpreted precisely to the day.  The date is fixed by statute at :  The Secretary shall, in the year 1980 and every 10 years thereafter, take a decennial census of population as of the first day of April of such year....This requires that the census seek data describing the population on April 1, 2020.  It does not require that census workers actually visit people on that day.  They could conceivably do it in mid August, for example, or at any other time.  Of course, that would probably reduce the reliability of the census.  Congress could pass a law moving the census date to another later date if they wanted to get a more accurate count of the population on that date instead of a less accurate count of the population on the first of April.In fact, when I got home later in the day after writing this answer, there was a letter from the census bureau inviting me to submit my census survey through the internet.  I did that a few minutes ago, so if I die in the next two weeks, the census will be off by one.The letter I got says that if I don't fill out the survey online, they'll send me a paper questionnaire.  If I don't fill that out, someone will come to visit.  The prospect of that happening on April 1st seems quite remote."}
{"question":"For example, If I got a PhD from a school in Pakistan or North Korea would the United States still legally recognize it?","answer":"No. Nor would the United States recognize your degree if you got them from the UK or France, or even from within the United States. The United States does not legally protect or sanction PhD holders as such, and has no role in the awarding of nor forming guidelines for PhD programs (other than funding, directly or indirectly, much of the research that is required).Your comments suggest that you think there are legal issues with falsely claiming to hold a doctorate; there are not, outside of normal fraud concerns for deception (wherein someone relies on you or your expertise to their detriment, based on your ), which can affect legitimate doctorate holder's as well (for example, someone with a doctorate in Music presenting themselves as an expert in Economics, for the purposes of soliciting investments, say).For example there are a variety of performers who do not hold doctorates, but legally have stage names containing 'Doctor'( has a dozen), because they are committing fraud in doing so (a claim of 'I liked this song when I thought it was written by a PhD' would be laughed out of court, because holding a PhD has no bearing on musical composition).There are, however, legal issues with falsely claiming to be a member of certain legally regulated and licensed professions in the United States, such as lawyers and physicians. I believe that this is the source of your confusion, as these professions often have protected titles that contain the term 'doctor', such as physicians (MD, for Medical Doctor, and dentists(DDS, for Doctor of Dental Surgery). It should also be noted that physicians are almost universally addressed as 'Doctor', but very few actually hold doctorates, the MD being a non-academic professional degree that doesn't require doing any new research."}

{"question":"Do legislators actually have to take the step of banning bump stocks, or could the ATF (or other government agency) unilaterally state that the addition of one to a weapon means that it now has all of the attributes of a Machine Gun as defined in the ?'Machine gun.' (b) The term 'machine gun ' means any weapon which shoots,   or is designed to shoot, automatically or semiautomatically, more   than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of   the trigger.My intuition is that if the answer is 'yes,' then owners of bump stocks could still own them without breaking the law, they just won't ever be able to apply that accessory to their weapons without running afoul of the National Firearms Act and risking a $2,000 fine and 5 years in jail. Is this understanding of how the law works correct?","answer":"Under current  (under the 'frame designed for converting' clause), which are banned. As the above Docket No. 2017R\u201322 (from December 26, 2017) says, DoJ expects to plan to discuss changing the rules. They might then be outlawed by executive action (though a court test could be necessary, since executive wish is not the final word on interpreting statutes). The relevant part of the definition of machine gun, which could apply to bump stocks, is:  The term shall also include the frame or receiver of any such weapon,  any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination  of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a  machinegun, and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can  be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control  of a person.But 'such' weapon is one that  shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot,  automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a  single function of the triggerThe definition does not say anything about a single finger action, so there is a reasonable probability that including bump stocks within the scope of existing legislation would be held to exceed congressional authority."}

{"question":"As a general rule, civil suits for copyright violation exist to recover damages caused by the violation, and prevent future damage thereof. Under that standard, a rather novel form of copyright seems impossible to defend: copyleft licenses.Copyleft, the common descriptor for copyright licenses which allow free use provided any derivative works are released under similarly free terms, attempts to force the spread of open content (most typically software) through clever usage of conditional license grants, most notably used in the GNU General Public License. But how could this possibly be enforced in court? Because this sort of license was designed to guard against violation of one's beliefs, rather than financial damage, in the case of a violation, it would seem one could only claim moral damage.In short, how would one possibly justify a copyleft violation suit in a court of law?Edit:For the purpose of this question, I'm referring alternately to either US law or EU law, as I'm curious about both given the clear differences in intellectual property law between the two.","answer":"  As a general rule, civil suits for copyright violation exist to recover damages caused by the violation, and prevent future damage thereof.With respect to US law, that's not entirely accurate.Under US law, damages for copyright infringement are governed by .  If infringement can be proved, the copyright holder has two options:Recover 'actual damages' plus any profits that were attributable to the infringement.  So suppose Alice licenses her free software under copyleft.  Bob uses it in violation of the license to create a product which he sells.  Even though Alice was not going to make any money by selling the software herself (so her actual damages are zero), she can still recover whatever profits Bob made from his sales.  She doesn't have to prove that she was damaged; all she has to do is show that Bob earned revenue attributable to the infringement (and then it is up to Bob to show how much of that revenue went to expenses instead of profit).Recover statutory damages.  The law specifies statutory damages of $750 to $30,000 per work infringed, to be determined by the court; this can be increased to $150,000 if the infringement was willful, or reduced to $200 if the infringer had no reason to know he was doing so.  Again, it doesn't matter that Alice didn't suffer any actual damages, and she doesn't have to prove that she did.  It also doesn't matter whether Bob profited from his infringement in any way, and again Alice doesn't have to prove that he did.So Alice certainly has options to make Bob suffer for his infringement even if she didn't suffer any financial damage.I don't know the situation for EU law, so I'll let someone else address it."}
{"question":"Do I become the owner of a device someone lets me borrow if I can't return it? Say someone lets me borrow their iPad since I need an Apple platform for a project. They say I don't need to return it soon since it's an older one they don't really use anymore. Months later, I try contacting the person more than one time on Facebook Messenger, letting them know I'll be at a place to return the device if they want it back, but they ignore the messages by leaving me on read (i.e., they view the messages without replying).In examples such as the above where you borrow a device and contact someone so you can return it, but such attempts are clearly ignored by the owner, are you legally permitted to consider the device yours, now? If not, would you be guilty of larceny if you assumed ownership, or would you only be guilty if the original owner wanted it back, but you refused?","answer":"De facto it's yours, but de jure it still belongs to the owner.  You might have some luck with abandonment, but unless we're talking about something like a car, it's unlikely to matter.  And abandonment will likely just allow you to have it towed away, not to have it re-titled in your name.  Your jurisdiction will matter, and if the value is enough to warrant it, a lawyer would probably help."}
{"question":"BackgroundIn the United States, the :TITLE 1 -- GENERAL PROVISIONSCHAPTER 2 -- ACTS AND RESOLUTIONS; FORMALITIES OF ENACTMENT; REPEALS;SEALING OF INSTRUMENTSSec. 106b. Amendments to ConstitutionWhenever official notice is received at the National Archives andRecords Administration that any amendment proposed to the Constitutionof the United States has been adopted, according to the provisions ofthe Constitution, the Archivist of the United States shall forthwithcause the amendment to be published, with his certificate, specifyingthe States by which the same may have been adopted, and that the samehas become valid, to all intents and purposes, as a part of theConstitution of the United States.In addition, the NARA has also received recession or rejections of certain Constitutional amendments from the states, the validity of which is not pronounced by the head archivist, but is seen as conclusive by another (unnamed) authority as stated :In a few instances, States have sent official documents to NARA to record the rejection of an amendment or the rescission of a prior ratification. The Archivist does not make any substantive determinations as to the validity of State ratification actions, but it has been established that the Archivist's certification of the facial legal sufficiency of ratification documents is final and conclusive.Since the most credible source I found on the matter does not state who \"established\" that the legal sufficiency of ratification documents is final and conclusive, I wanted to ask the following question:QuestionWhat authority (or authorities) has established that the facial legal sufficiency of ratification documents is final and conclusive?","answer":"From what I read, it appears that the final quoted statement is not saying another authority does this so much as the Archivist does not do it.   Which would mean that the when the state notifies the Archivist and says 'We ratified the amendment' the Archivist accepts that the state did all required steps to ratify the amendment and doesn't need to tick a check box list of steps.Or to put anotherway, the lawful Ratification of a Constitutional Amendment in a State is determined by the state's own institutions and not the Federal Government's.  Once the state says it's ratified, the Feds assume it was done so following the states own processes and was not done in an underhanded fashion."}
{"question":"Similar to another post, customer lies to a hotel about their age, but it doesn't garner any damages.i.e. A 17y\/o purchases a room for the night, but lies and says they are 18.It doesn't change the price, and a minor over 16 can legally purchase a room. Thus there are no legal damages. However some public \"outrage\" is garnered over it (no decrease in sales happen after the incident comes to light).If the hotel wanted to, would they have any legal grounds against the 17y\/o for lying?","answer":"If there is &quot;outrage&quot; that is, potentially, damage to the hotel's reputation. But this has some significant problems before such a case can succeed.There has to be some &quot;wrong&quot; done by the 17 y\/o. Very often there is an implied duty to tell the truth, and so lying is very often wrong.  But there are exceptions. There are many reasons that person might lie and not all are &quot;wrong&quot;.There has to be some harm that occurs as a result of the wrong. Damage to reputation is one possible harm. But in this case, I would ask if the damage was caused by the lie, or caused by the acts of the hotel. If, for example, a shop is selling cigarettes to children, and not checking age id, then the damage to the reputation is not caused by the lie, but by the failure of the shop to check.  So the question here is, was it reasonable for the 17 y\/o to expect the damage to reputation. Did the hotel cause its own loss of reputation.  I think it would be very hard for the hotel to establish that the harm to its reputation was caused by the lie, and not caused by its own practices. It is not sufficient for the wrong to have merely offered the opportunity for the hotel to harm itself. You can't claim for losses that you could have reasonably avoided. These are the principles of &quot;remoteness&quot;, &quot;causation&quot; and &quot;mitigation&quot;.Finally, there has to be something that the court can put right.  If there has been no loss in bookings, then the hotel would have to argue that either bookings would have been expected to be even higher, or that there was some other way of establishing what the company has lost, for example, costs that the company has endured to correct the loss of reputation.  Again these costs can't be things that the hotel should have been doing anyway.So any such case would face considerable problems and would be unlikely to succeed."}
{"question":"In the USA, can sweepstakes require that users fill out a survey to enter? I understand that users obviously cannot be made to pay to enter but the concept of a mandatory survey seems less clear. Is this considered to be 'consideration'?According to , special legal advice is necessary when a survey, questionnaire or repeat visits to a website or location are  required to enter the promotion.Meanwhile,  says that surveys are included in the definition of 'consideration':When you hear the word consideration, it's referring to [...] or  engaging in activities that require a considerable amount of time  (like filling out an in-depth survey for example or making multiple  in-store visits).So are surveys always a form of consideration? What constitutes if a survey is 'in depth' or not?It seems to me that there are scenarios in which it is legal. For example, in order to enter the Alaska Airlines Sweepstakes, their  state: To enter the Sweepstakes, complete the survey at  www.alaskalistens.comThus, my question is when is it legal to ask for a survey entry that is mandatory?","answer":"Consideration in a contract is the obligatory giving something of value in return for something of value.Objectively, the sweepstakes ticket is valuable and so is the data in a survey. If the completion of the survey is required this this makes it a raffle, not a sweepstakes. You can ask someone to complete an optional survey providing they get the ticket either way. You can also collect data that is necessary to give effect to the sweepstake such as contact details even though these have value."}

However, there are no cases of people going to jail for downloading.There is one case of people getting jailed for distributing.So my question is, if a person is found guilty of software piracy in the US, what factors determine if that person will be given a custodial sentence, and how heavily does each factor weigh?The previous question  only says whether it's illegal. Of course it is.I am asking whether it's 'wise' to break the law in this case? How likely you will get caught? What's the penalty? How many went to jail already for this? Any court cases?","answer":"Every country has its own copyright laws. In the US, the first thing it depends on is the Department of Justice, which decides whether to prosecute. This is the . One of three things must be true, for criminal prosecution. One is that the action was 'for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain'; or, 'by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180\u2013day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000'; or 'by the distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, by making it available on a computer network accessible to members of the public, if such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution'.The stipulation that this is 'for personal use' precludes re-distribution cases, but leaves open the possibility of jail time for 'massive' personal infringement. It is highly likely that many infringers do in fact download more than $1,000 worth of content in a 180 day period.  from the Bureau of Justice Statistics notes that  Of the 134 IP theft defendants sentenced in 2002, 58 (43%) received  some imprisonment with a term ranging from 1 to 46 months and a median  of 15 months. In 1998, 34% of defendants were sentenced to prison with  a range  of 1 to 30 months and median of 10 months.However, this does not narrowly report just 'personal use infringement' imprisonments. One can speculate as to why the federal government is not more aggressive with prosecuting personal-use downloaders. The first reason (in the long list of reasons) is that personal-use downloaders are least likely to get caught. The last reason (on my list) is that under sentencing guidelines, a personal-use infringer is least likely to trigger imprisonment.  explains the factors that go into computing the seriousness of infringement. Imprisonment is not statutorily mandated, so it is very unlikely that a level 8 infringement conviction will result in imprisonment."}

{"question":"I stumbled across this news article: \"\"The article describes a music festival that was not allowed to sell bottled water to patrons, so they sold peanuts for $1.50 each and provided a \"free\" bottle of water with the purchase. The overall result is that the customer has paid $1.50 for a bottle of water and a peanut, but because the money was ostensibly exchanged for the peanut, nothing illegal has taken place.In fact, the placeholder purchase is not required, because each person could claim that they gave away the money or the item of their own free will, independent of expectation from the other.I'd like to know if this loophole, regardless of the goods that are forbidden to be sold, has ever been challenged in a court of law and what the outcome was. I don't care too much about jurisdiction but I'd prefer answers from the United States or countries with legal systems descended from English Common Law (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom).","answer":"Depends on the lawIt's unclear if this is a contractural restriction on the shop or a local ordinance relating to the festival. In any event, it depends on the law and what, precisely, the shop is doing.If the restriction is on supply, this doesn't work. If it's on sale then this might work if done properly.If it is a contractural restriction that the shop freely entered, it is unlikely that this ruse would protect them from a breach of contract suit because the shop is obviously acting in bad faith in a calculated attempt to avoid their obligations.If it really is a law restricting sales, then giving it away free would work. However, what the shop is doing is not giving away free water - they are bundling a peanut and a bottle of water and selling that. To avoid liability, the shop would need to give the water away for free without selling the peanut to anyone that asked.An analogous case related to liquor happened in . All states in Australia require a liquor licence to sell alcohol in most cases, however, providing you comply with responsible service laws, it's not illegal to give it away to the public.As is common, many hairdressers provide their customers with a complementary glass of wine. This is fine in Queensland or Western Australia because those states have specific exemptions for hairdressers, but illegal in NSW.A salon owner in Sydney was successfully prosecuted for this practice because, when the undercover police officer requested a free glass without a haircut, she was denied. The magistrate concluded that this meant the wine was not, in fact, free and that the salon was therefore selling liquor without a licence. At $11,000 per glass, the salon lost money on the deal."}

{"question":"Why do courts allow attorneys to demand Yes-or-No answers to their questions? I'm seeing a lot of that in the Chauvin trial.Attorneys are prohibited from asking leading questions, and from badgering the witness. Demanding Yes-or-No answers seems worse in my book:\"Has the defendant stopped regularly beating his wife and kids? Yes or no?\" (Not an actual example, but here to demonstrate the absurdity of demanding Yes-or-No answers)","answer":"The parties are generally entitled to present their case as they see fit, as long as they stay within the rules of evidence. If they want a straight yes or no, the court will often require the witness to provide one, which keeps lawyers happy, makes the answers clear for the jury, and limits the parties' grounds for appeal.If a yes or no answer is not as accurate as a more qualified answer, the other lawyer would typically have an opportunity to invite the witness to provide a fuller answer on redirect.If a yes or no answer is inappropriate because of assumption embedded in the question -- as in your &quot;beating his wife and kids&quot; example -- the question should quickly elicit an objection from the defense attorney, who would note that the question lacks foundation or assumes facts not in evidence. Assuming there isn't any evidence of domestic violence, the court should sustain the objection, in which case the witness would not need to answer at all."}

{"question":"Does the U.S. Constitutional power of the President to pardon extend to crimes not yet committed?I know Ford gave Nixon a blanket pardon, but he did so for acts that (might have) been committed in the past.","answer":"No.The relevant provision of the United States Constitution is Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 which states in the pertinent part:  The President . . . shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons  for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of  Impeachment.The correct conclusion flows pretty directly from the definition of a 'reprieve' and a 'pardon', both of which, in the ordinary senses of these words refer to granting forgiveness for acts that have already occurred.One of the leading cases on point which supports this view is Ex parte Garland, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 307, 380 (1855), which states:  The power thus conferred is unlimited, with the exception stated. It  extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any  time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken,  or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment. This power  of the President is not subject to legislative control. Congress can  neither limit the effect of his pardon, nor exclude from its exercise  any class of offenders. The benign prerogative of mercy reposed in him  cannot be fettered by any legislative restrictions.Despite its antiquity, this case remains good law and has been applied repeatedly in subsequent cases (although few on the right of a President to pardon future crimes which just hasn't come up).Other ObservationsThe President's pardon power is limited to federal crimes, so no President may pardon or commute a state or foreign conviction.The nature of the pardon power, if any, with respect to state and local crimes is governed by each respective state constitution and varies rather considerably.The power in the U.S. Constitution is broader than that is some state constitutions. For example, the corresponding provision of the Colorado Constitution, applicable to convictions entered by the state of Colorado, does not allow crimes to be pardoned prior to a conviction.  Article IV, Section 7, of the Colorado Constitution provides:    'The governor shall have the power to grant reprieves, commutations  and pardons after conviction, for all offenses except treason * * *.'The History Of The Pardon PowerOne of the most thorough and up to date reviews of the scope and nature of the federal pardon power can be found in the law review article, Todd David Peterson, 'Congressional Power Over Pardon and Amnesty: Legislative Authority In The Shadow of Presidential Prerogative' 38 Wake Forest L. Rev. 1225 (2003). In particular, it has an interesting historical overview of the power at pages 1228-1235 (pagination and footnotes omitted):  The President's pardon power derives from the authority that had been  invested in English kings since the end of the first millennium.  Although the King possessed plenary power to grant pardons, over the  years Parliament imposed specific limitations on the pardon power in  order to avoid perceived abuses. For example, the Habeas Corpus Act of  1679 made it an offense for any person to imprison an English subject  outside of the country and, in order to avoid an evasion of the writ,  Parliament prohibited the King from granting a pardon for violation of  the statute. Nevertheless, English courts frequently took an  absolutist view of the King's pardon power. Thus, in Godden v. Hales,  the Lord Chief Justice upheld a royal pardon on the ground that the  Kings of England were absolute sovereigns; . . . the laws were the  King's laws; . . . the King had a power to dispense with any of the  laws of Government as he saw necessity for it; . . . he was sole judge  of that necessity; that no act of Parliament could take away that  power.    The Parliament, however, persisted in its efforts to rein in the  pardon power and, in 1700, adopted the Act of Settlement, which stated  that 'no pardon under the great seal of England [shall] be pleadable  to an impeachment by the commons in Parliament.' This limitation was  enforced against the King, although it did not apply to pardons  granted to relieve punishments imposed after the impeachment of an  official. The royal pardon prerogative was imported into the American  colonies whose charters gave the leaders substantial authority to  pardon offenses.    At the Constitutional Convention of 1787, neither the Virginia plan  nor the New Jersey plan contained a pardon power. Nevertheless, at the  insistence of Charles Pinckney, Alexander Hamilton, and John Rutledge,  a pardon clause similar to the English Act of Settlement of 1700 was  added to the draft constitution. Thus, the first report of the  Committee on Detail proposed that the clause read: 'He [the President]  shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons; but his pardon shall  not be pleadable in bar of an impeachment.'    The issue of legislative control over the pardon process was addressed  directly by an amendment proposed by Roger Sherman of Connecticut.  James Madison's journal notes that 'Mr. Sherman moved to amend the  power to grant reprieves and pardon' so as to readto grant  reprieves until the ensuing session of the Senate, and pardons with  consent of the Senate.''  George Mason argued that the Senate already  possessed too much authority, and the proposed amendment was rejected  by a vote of eight to one.    The convention did approve a motion to insert 'except in cases of  impeachment' after pardon and remove the words 'but his pardon shall  not be pleadable in bar.' Luther Martin then sought to limit the  President's power to grant pre-conviction pardons by inserting the  words 'after conviction,' following the words 'reprieves and pardons.'  Martin, however, withdrew his motion after James Wilson argued that  'pardon before conviction might be necessary, in order to obtain the  testimony of accomplices.' Edmund Randolph then offered an amendment  to exclude 'cases of treason' from the pardoning power. This proposed  amendment was defeated, although its exclusion was later to prove  controversial. Thus, although the framers realized that the pardon  power was subject to potential abuse by the President, they declined  to place any limitations on the President's pardon power or grant the  legislature any authority to check potential presidential abuses.    The debates following the convention's passage of the Constitution  reveal more about the framers' views on the pardon power. In the  Federalist 74, Alexander Hamilton attempted to respond to the  criticism that the President could pardon his accomplices in a case of  treason. Hamilton acknowledged that 'there are strong reasons to be  assigned for requiring in this particular the concurrence of [the  legislative] body or of a part of it.' Hamilton argued, however, that  the reasons against such legislative authority outweighed any in its  favor: '[i]t is not to be doubted that a single man of prudence and  good sense, is better fitted, in delicate conjunctures, to balance the  motives, which may plead for and against the remission of the  punishment, than any numerous body whatever.' In particular, Hamilton  argued, in the case of large scale seditions that attracted  significant popular support, we might expect to see the representation  of the people tainted with the same spirit, which had given birth to  the offense. And when parties were pretty equally matched, the secret  sympathy of the friends and favorers of the condemned person, availing  itself of the good nature and weakness of others, might frequently  bestow impunity where the terror of an example was necessary.    Thus, Hamilton argued not only that the power was properly reposed in  the President, but that it would be dangerous to grant such power to  Congress.    Finally, Hamilton argued that it was appropriate to grant the  President pardon power in order to ensure that the authority could be  exercised with appropriate dispatch:    'In seasons of insurrection or rebellion, there are often critical  moments, when a well timed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels  may restore the tranquility of the commonwealth; and which, if  suffered to pass unimproved, it may never be possible afterwards to  recall. The dilatory process of convening the Legislature, or one of  its branches, for the purpose of obtaining its sanction to the  measure, would frequently be the occasion of letting slip the golden  opportunity. The loss of a week, a day, an hour, may sometimes be  fatal. If it should be observed that a discretionary power with a view  to such contingencies might be occasionally conferred upon the  President; it may be answered in the first place, that it is  questionable whether, in a limited constitution, that power could be  delegated by law; and in the second place, that it would generally be  impolitic before-hand to take any step which might hold out the  prospect of impunity.'    There was little debate about the pardoning power during the state  ratifying conventions. George Mason continued to argue that the power  should not be given to the President. An opponent in New York  suggested that pardons for treason should not be allowed without  congressional consent. Ultimately, the Constitution was adopted  without any express limitation on the President's pardoning power.    The Supreme Court has on a number of occasions discussed the general  scope of the pardoning power. For the most part, with exceptions to be  discussed later, these decisions contain broad dicta concerning the  unfettered nature of the President's power and the inability of  Congress to impose any legislative restrictions on it. For example, in  United States v. Wilson, the Court held that a pardon must be pleaded  in order to be effective. Chief Justice Marshall wrote that the  [C]onstitution gives to the [P]resident, in general terms, 'the power  to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United  States.'    As this power had been exercised from time immemorial by the executive  of that nation whose language is our language, and to whose judicial  institutions ours bear a close resemblance; we adopt their principles  respecting the operation and effect of a pardon, and look into their  books for the rules prescribing the manner in which it is to be used  by the person who would avail himself of it. Marshall further defined  the pardon as an act of grace, proceeding from the power entrusted  with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual, on whom  it is bestowed, from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he  has committed. It is the private, though official act of the executive  magistrate, delivered to the individual for whose benefit it is  intended, and not communicated officially to the court.    In Ex parte Wells, the Supreme Court considered whether the  President could grant a conditional pardon in the form of commutation  of a death sentence to a sentence of life imprisonment. The Court  noted that pursuant to the Pardon Clause, the President has granted  reprieves and pardons since the commencement of the present  government. Sundry provisions have been enacted, regulating its  exercise for the army and navy, in virtue of the constitutional power  of [C]ongress to make rules and regulations for the government of the  army and navy. No statute has ever been passed regulating it in cases  of conviction by the civil authorities. In such cases, the President  has acted exclusively under the power as it is expressed in the  [C]onstitution.    The Court noted, however, that '[t]here are also pardons grantable as  of common right, without any exercise of the king's discretion; as  where a statute creating an offence, or enacting penalties for its  future punishment, holds out a promise of immunity to accomplices to  aid in the conviction of their associates. When accomplices do so  voluntarily, they have a right absolutely to a pardon . . . .'    Thus, at least in dicta, the Court recognized Congress's authority to  regulate clemency in the military and to adopt statutes granting  immunity for cooperation in a criminal investigation.    In Ex parte Garland, the Court spoke in sweeping dicta about the  exclusive power of the President over pardon and amnesty. In Garland,  the Court considered the issue whether a former Confederate senator  would be permitted to be a member of the Supreme Court Bar without  taking the statutorily required oath that he had never voluntarily  given aid or comfort to the confederacy. The petitioner had received a  presidential pardon and argued that the pardon exempted him from the  requirements of the oath to which he could not truthfully subscribe.  The Court held that it was 'not within the constitutional power of  Congress thus to inflict punishment beyond the reach of executive  clemency,' and therefore, the petitioner was entitled to membership in  the Bar. In the course of the opinion, the Court broadly defined the  President's pardon power:    'The power thus conferred is unlimited, with the exception stated. It  extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any  time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken,  or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment. This power  of the President is not subject to legislative control. Congress can  neither limit the effect of his pardon, nor exclude from its exercise  any class of offenders. The benign prerogative of mercy reposed in him  cannot be fettered by any legislative restrictions.'    In Ex parte Grossman, the Court considered whether the President's  pardon power extended to criminal contempts of court. The Court upheld  the President's power to issue such pardons based on the history of  royal pardons for contempt in England. The Court also looked to the  long history of presidential pardons of criminal contempts of court.  In responding to the argument that a presidential pardon of contempt  of court would interfere with the ability of the federal courts to  protect their own decrees, Chief Justice Taft noted that the  Constitution provides a number of powers to the branches which give  them the ability to check the other branches of government. With  respect to the pardon power, the Court stated: '[t]he executive can  reprieve or pardon all offenses after their commission, either before  trial, during trial or after trial, by individuals, or by classes,  conditionally or absolutely, and this without modification or  regulation by Congress.' The Court also noted that the President  exercised the pardon power without any significant judicial check on  his pardoning authority:    'It is a check entrusted to the executive for special cases. To  exercise it to the extent of destroying the deterrent effect of  judicial punishment would be to pervert it; but whoever is to make it  useful must have full discretion to exercise it. Our Constitution  confers this discretion on the highest officer in the nation in  confidence that he will not abuse it. An abuse in pardoning contempts  would certainly embarrass courts, but it is questionable how much more  it would lessen their effectiveness than a wholesale pardon of other  offenses. If we could conjure up in our minds a President willing to  paralyze courts by pardoning all criminal contempts, why not a  President ordering a general jail delivery?'    In Biddle v. Perovich, Justice Holmes wrote an opinion for the Court  in which he upheld the President's conditional pardon of a convict  sentenced to death on the condition that his sentence be commuted to  life imprisonment. Justice Holmes suggested a different rationale for  the pardon power than Chief Justice Marshall had enunciated early in  the 19th century. Rather than being a private act of grace that must  be accepted and proffered to the court by the one pardoned, Justice  Holmes saw the President's pardon as serving public policy ends:    'A pardon in our days is not a private act of grace from an individual  happening to possess power. It is a part of the Constitutional scheme.  When granted it is the determination of the ultimate authority that  the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what  the judgment fixed. . . . Just as the original punishment would be  imposed without regard to the prisoner's consent and in the teeth of  his will, whether he liked it or not, the public welfare, not his  consent, determines what shall be done.'"}
{"question":"As I understand it, under US criminal law, a defendant may decline to testify in their own trial.Suppose a defendant elects to testify in their own trial but decides that it is no longer in their best interest to continue. Can they leave the witness box at a whim. For example mid-question by either defence or prosecution. Could they perhaps say to the judge, \"I no longer wish to testify, may I step down?\" and the judge allow this?Conversely, if the trial is going badly and, at the last moment, they decide that they do want to testify in order to bolster their position, can they request this and it be granted, even at the last minute?Are there any precedents for these actions by a defendant?","answer":"Once an accused, or any other witness, has started to testify, the other side has a right to cross-examination, and the witness may not leave without responding to any cross-examination that the pother attorney may choose to make (subject to objections and rulings by the judge, of course). The accused, unlike other witnesses, could tell his or her lawyer to stop the main examination at any point, but might well be very unwise to override the lawyer on such a point.The Judge controls the details of procedure, but normally each side may present their witnesses in any other that they please, although the prosecution may need to establish the fact of the crime before going on to other matters. The defense may change tactics in mid-trial, although it may not be able to add witnesses that it did not mention to the other side at a specified point in the pre-trial process. But it can notify the prosecution of witnesses that it may or may not choose to call."}
{"question":"Are there any jurisdictions in the US which make it illegal (against the law rather than against some contract or custom) to charge higher prices for categories of customers based on their employment.

For example, can a restaurant post a sign which demands a $100 entry fee for anyone employed by any city or state government or for anyone who is a doctor or a lawyer?Clearly, customers can lie about their employer, but that's not the point.  The point is that if anyone enters and then claims to be in a certain employment situation, then they would create a liability by making that claim.","answer":"Washington D.C.'s anti-discrimination laws currently include political affiliation and source of income.  Given that the city is home to a wide arrange of political actors from Congressmen\/women to lobbyists for various causes, these laws were enacted so various industries may not refuse service to someone based on political affiliation or making money as a lobbyist for a cause they disagree with.  Personally I wouldn't mind seeing this elsewhere in the nation, but I'm not sure if there are any other jurisdiction that does this in the U.S.  There is talk about enacting protections against discriminatory protections against service for Uniformed First Responders (typically police) though most incidents I'm aware of this kind of discrimination are employees of fast food restaurants that will receive some public backlash that forces company higher ups to discipline the employee.Certain chains of restaurants do offer discounts to members of a certain profession.

On Memorial Day, they set a table aside (complete with table cloth, candle, dishes, and a single red rose) for those lost in service to the country.   Most famously, because their primary food product became so associated, Dunkin' Donuts initially offered free coffee and donuts to cops, giving police their trademark favorite food.   This wasn't so much of a promotion as a mutual exchange of services:  Cops (especially those working the Graveyard shift) typically enjoy their caffinated and sugary foods for keeping alert, as well as an occasion parking spot to write up reports... Dunkin' Donuts, one of the first chains to run 24\/7 service in the U.S. needed some security (especially during the Graveyard shift, when robbers were more likely to cause trouble because of very few witnesses) and found that for the price of a donut and some coffee, they could have the city's finest sitting in their parking lot, sipping coffee and writing reports, for way cheaper than hiring a security service.  (This practice was discontinued eventually as police forces saw these gifts as a possible corrupting influence and told officers to pay for their coffee.  It wasn't that Dunkin' was bribing cops, so much as it was creating a bad image to the public.)"}
{"question":"New Jersey Rule of Professional Conduct 3.4(g) provides that an attorney shall not \u2026 present, participate in presenting, or threaten to present criminal charges to obtain an improper advantage in a civil matter. Doing so is a form of intimidation and harassment that threatens the integrity of the civil process and is prejudicial to the administration of justice.I have two questions:Is this illegal or only unethical?Does the above apply to a ProSe plaintiff\/defendant or only to an attorney?","answer":"The Rules of Professional Conduct apply only to lawyers and are the foundation for  a lawyer to be suspended from the practice of law or disbarred or receive other license related professional discipline. They are neither criminal offenses, nor on their own, a grounds for a civil lawsuit (although they may be relevant to an element of a civil cause of action giving rise to a lawsuit).The Rules of Professional Conduct also prohibit using a non-lawyer as a sock puppet to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.But, the Rules of Professional Conduct themselves are not applicable to pro se parties or even to non-lawyer parties who are acting fully independently of the lawyers they have retained.In some circumstances, a violation of Rule of Professional Conduct 3.4(g) could also constitute the crime of extortion, or could constitute duress such that an action taken in the course of litigation or a business deal is not actually legally considered to be voluntary and making it potentially voidable. But this would not always, or necessarily even usually, be the case.Incidentally, Rule of Professional Conduct 3.4 is one of the Rules of Professional Conduct with the most state to state substantive variations and it also has multiple differing interpretations even in cases where the language is verbatim identical between states. The appropriate scope of this rule as a matter of policy is one of considerable controversy.

{"question":"I've been reading a . I don't understand why 'Computer Employees' are classified differently from Professional employees. What is the justification for that difference?","answer":"  Why does the US FLSA have a separate classification for Computer  Employees?Based on the rationale in , one may infer that FLSA seeks to protect  workers who perform work involving repetitive operations with their  hands, physical skill and energy [...] [where] the skills and  knowledge required for performance of their routine manual and  physical work through apprenticeships and on-the-job training, not  through the prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction  required for exempt learned professional employees such as medical  doctors, architects and archeologistsTo reach the same goal, Congress could have amended the preceding excerpt by adding computer employees in the list of learned professional employees. However, my conjecture is that Congress' decision to address computer employees separately is to identify that the effects of their job are of 'substantial importance' to the employer or clients, and therefore cannot be considered the type of predominantly clerical employment that FSLA protects.

Why is this?","answer":"This is more a question about society and politics than about the law; that is, you know what the law is you want to know why.Without any research and no idea of the particulars I can say that the reason is historical and derives from the fact that our society has been (and still is) a patriarchy and has deeply ingrained sexism (along with a lot of other -isms). These laws were laid down when it was considered not only acceptable but prudent and reasonable to treat men and women differently and nobody has got around to changing them.That said, they are quite likely unconstitutional as discrimination on the basis of sex is unlawful.

() ","answer":"Whether or not a war between political entities can result from some action is completely political and strategic, and not legal. The specific incident is probably legal, given US and international law regarding military action. Unless the order was self-evidently unlawful there is no possibility of arrest and prosecution under US law, however there might be a framework for legal action by Iran, if e.g. a drone operator were to fall into Iranian hands. The specifics of the order are not generally known, though we know that  discusses targeted killing from a legal perspective. In the context of war, killing is legal though not entirely unregulated.

However,   No case has discussed precisely whether a plaintiff can proceed on a  Bivens action that claims deprivation of life without due process  based on the overseas killing by United States officials of a U.S.  citizen deemed to be an active enemy.In the discussion, the question arises whether special circumstances counsel hesitation ( and citations therein), which the Doe court notes would 'require a court to delve into the military's policies', and they will not do that lightly.

If someone were to give you a physical copy of their resume (assuming such a thing would happen in this day and age) then giving this to someone else without copying it is not copyright violation. There may be privacy issues involved but that's another issue.Further, in the United States, there is a  doctrine which allows limited copying without permission in certain circumstances. This is likely to apply in a lot of situations around copying resumes.Finally, permission does not have to be explicit. For example, if you receive a resume in the course of a job application then permission to make copies for that purpose can be assumed to have been implicitly given.  Can you get sued if the resume finds its way to someone the author did not intend to see it, and the author suffers some harm as a result?Under privacy law, possibly. Under copyright law, no.What you can be sued for is making a copy. It doesn't matter where this ends up.

{"question":"Suppose that a person is  a data scientist employed by the data analytics arm of an auto maker.Suppose this person is continuing my old research and developing a software product:outside of company hours,without using company resources(laptop, data, people etc.)in an area where this company doesn'thave any existing product or expertise inMy questions are :Can the employer claim rights to the IP of this product in future ?Is there a way that the developer can protect this IP from potential claim by his or her current employer in future ?State and Country of Employer and Employee : Michigan, USA","answer":"General rulesThis depends entirely on the details of the employment agreement between the employee and the employer. In the US, the default is that work done &quot;in the scope of employment&quot; is work made for hire. That is, work that is part of an employee's regular job assignment belongs to the employer from the start.But an employment agreement can either broaden or narrow that standard, and will be generally honored. Many employers require agreements that work done during wok hours, or using work resources be assigned to the employer. Some require work in a field where the company has a product, or even all creative work be assigned to the employer.Some jurisdictions have laws limiting the scope of such laws, but most US stats do not.  Since the question does not indicate a country, nor a state or province,  there is no way to judge the applicability of any such law.An employee could ask the company, perhaps through an HR department, what its policy is on such matters.If an agreement requires creative work to be assigned, and the local law permits such an agreement, then an employee probably has no way to prevent such an agreement from being effective.Given the conditions stated in the question, only the most sweeping of assignment agreements would apply, and those are the most likely to be regulated by local law.In US law, there is a subtle but significant difference between work-made-for-hire (WFH) and work assigned by employee to the employer under an agreement. Under US law, the employer is the legal &quot;author&quot; of WFH, and the employee's lifespan is not used in measuring the term of the copyright, neither does the employee have rights to terminate the transfer later. Assigned work lists the employee as author, but transfers the copyright at once to the employer. This distinction does not occur in the laws of most European countries. Indeed in Germany, copyrights may not be owned by a corporation, but only by a natural person, and can only be transferred by inheritance, although they can be licensed to a corporation.US Copyright Law<h4>Works Made for Hire<\/h4> provides that:A work made for hire is(1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or(2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as ... [list of 9 specific categories of work] ...  , if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.Since the question specifies that the creator is an employee, part (1) of the definition of WFH applies. And if the creation was not assigned to the employee, was not done during work hours, and is in a field where the company has no products or intents, in could hardly be within he &quot;scope of employment&quot;.If the creator were a contractor, there would have to be an explicit agreement making the work a WFH. If there is not, no WFH. Besides, &quot;software&quot; is not one of the 9 categorizes.In either case, the project is not WFH<h4>Copyright Transfer<\/h4> provides that:(d) Transfer of Ownership.(d) (1) The ownership of a copyright may be transferred in whole or in part by any means of conveyance or by operation of law, and may be bequeathed by will or pass as personal property by the applicable laws of intestate succession. provides that:(a) A transfer of copyright ownership, other than by operation of law, is not valid unless an instrument of conveyance, or a note or memorandum of the transfer, is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner's duly authorized agent.This means that an assignment agreement, assigning creations of the employee's to the employer, is legal under 17 USC. But there must be a written and signed agreement. If there is no such agreement, and WFH does not apply, no copyright is transferred.Michigan LawMichigan law explicitly permits non-compete agreements under  This ios not directly relevant, but states which prohibit non-compete contracts often also limit or prohibit IP assignment clauses in employment contracts.I can find no Michigan law specifically prohibiting or limiting IP assignment agreements (nor any MI law specifically authorizing them.) So they are probably lawful, on the same basis as any othet contract provision.ConclusionIn Michigan, an employer would gain teh right to employee creations, outside the scope of employment, if and only if there was a specific written and signed agreement giving the employer this right. This would be unusual, but not illegal.If such an agreement was signed by the employee it would be binding and enforceable."}
{"question":"In the interest of cross vendor compatibility, the method by which different technologies interoperate is often standardized. This means that a non binding agreement is made between multiple parties to abide by rules set forth in a documented standard.Examples of this include The USB Device Working Group, Jedec, The C++ Standards Committee, and PCI-SIG.While presumably in the public's interest, these groups appear to be a fragrant violation of antitrust laws. Do they require a special license to operate?If so, what would such a license look like and what agency would issue it?","answer":"Standards-setting by industry groups is not inherently anti-competitive and these groups do not require a licence from the government to operate. They are a prototypical example of &quot;private ordering&quot; (see David J. Teece &amp; Edward F. Sherry, &quot;Standards Setting and Antitrust&quot; (2003) , p. 1987).What can be anti-competitive is when a corporation advocates for an element to be included in a standard for reasons other than technical considerations. See e.g. the International Standards Organization's &quot;.&quot;An example violation is :According to the FTC complaint, Rambus nonetheless participated in JEDEC's DRAM standard-setting activities for more than four years without disclosing to JEDEC or its members that it was actively working to develop, and possessed, a patent and several pending patent applications that involved specific technologies ultimately adopted in the standards....In its liability opinion dated July 31, 2006, the Commission found that, Rambus engaged in exclusionary conduct that significantly contributed to its acquisition of monopoly power in four related markets.In , Dell Computer Corporation was alleged to havevoted to approve the VL-bus standard and certified that the standard did not infringe its intellectual property. After the standard became very successful, Dell asserted an earlier-issued patent against several computer manufacturers using the standard.The FTC entered a consent agreement with Dell:prohibiting Dell from enforcing its patent against those who wanted to use the VL-bus standard. The FTC's order also prohibited Dell from enforcing patent rights in the future when it intentionally failed to disclose those rights upon request of a standards-setting organization."}
{"question":"After seeing that a lot of manga reader websites are making advertisement money out of other people's copyrighted works, I was wondering how would it be to make a similar site, but where the advertisement income would be sent back to its appropriate owner. The transactions would be stated in a transparent way to show that I am not the one making money off those works.Since I would not be able to get the permission to publish their work, it would be clearly a purposeful copyright infringement. However, if people were to ask for a take down since they are being published elsewhere, I would willingly take them down and leave a link to their site. Now, I have two questions:Would they ask for a take down for any other reason, when various other manga reader websites are making money off them?Considering that myself is not going to be making any money off their work, does this still fall into the category of criminal act? If so, are there more than take down notices that can happen? (C&D? financial punishment? imprisoning?)","answer":"Would they ask for a take down for any other reason, when various other manga reader websites are making money off them?Merely looking at the fact that the other sites have not been taken down is not a good metric to decide if you will face an infringement suit for your own site. Consider the following possibilities:The manga on those sites may be published by a different publisher than the manga you want to host, and that publisher of your desired manga is more litigious.The manga publisher may not have been actively pursuing infringement for the last several years, but they may suddenly decide this fiscal year it's a financially good idea to start aggressively pursuing infringement. They will go after the other sites and your site at the same time.Because you plan to give them money, you are actively drawing attention to your infringing site. While they may not find it worth their while to seek out whatever new infringing sites pop up every week, in this case, they don't have to come looking for you. You show up to them, actively telling them that you're infringing their copyright.Of course, they might not care. They might love your idea. Regardless, the legally sound way to do this is to ask for permission before you do it, rather than forgiveness afterward. If you don't, you are certainly vulnerable to a lawsuit (whether or not the publisher will pursue the opportunity to sue you is a question left to the discretion of the publisher).<ol start='2'>Considering that myself is not going to be making any money off their work, does this still fall into the category of criminal act? If so, are there more than take down notices that can happen? (C&amp;D? financial punishment? imprisoning?)Having your infringing site taken down is the minimum that could happen. If you commit copyright infringement, the copyright holder is fully entitled to file a lawsuit against you at once. It's possible that they could just file a DMCA takedown notice to your ISP to have the content taken down, but they are entitled to sue you for damages as well.Maybe they won't sue you because it's not worth their while. If not: lucky you! So, ask yourself: do you feel lucky?Copyright infringement is typically a civil offense and only punished with fines. It can only qualify as a criminal offense  when the infringement is &quot;willful&quot; and meets one of the following criteria:(A) for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain;(B) by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000; or(C) by the distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, by making it available on a computer network accessible to members of the public, if such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution.As long as you don't violate any of those conditions, your infringement is not criminal. Condition B seems most likely, if I am reading it correctly: if your site serves a $10 book one hundred times, then you've met the $1000 threshold. The threshold of what makes an infringement &quot;willful&quot; versus &quot;ordinary&quot; is somewhat nebulous; see Wikipedia's article on ."}
{"question":"This is a question for the sake of a story, I'm not seeking legal advice to use in court, just fact checking general laws.  Any elaboration on interesting facets that may be useful for story writing is always welcomed as well :).Let's say that there is an individual whose actual identity is not known: he goes by the alias Kal-el.  Another individual, Clark Kent (yeah, I decided to get geeky with my names), has been accused of being this person in the past, and has told everyone that he is not this person, but he does know this person, and his real identity, but won't reveal that identity.Later Kal-el is somehow related to a crime (accused of doing it, or a witness, whatever), and the police need to know who he is as part of their investigation, thus they talk to Clark.  Let's say that Kal-el is a different person, but Clark does not want to admit this.  Could Clark ever be put in a position where he is forced to admit Kal-el's actual identity?  I assume he usually wouldn't, but if he is aware of Kal-el's involvement in a crime at some point he becomes an accessory by not revealing it?If there is a point at which Clark would usually be compelled by the court to give Kal-el's actual identity could Clark refuse to do it on the grounds that he has been accused of being Kal-el?  Arguing that if he is Kal-el he would be bearing witness against himself to admit it and is thus protected by the fifth amendment.  He has previously claimed he isn't in an unofficial capacity, but he is not going to make that claim legally, instead refusing to admit rather he is Kal-el or if Kal-el is someone who he knows.If you only allow him to plead the fifth if he is Kal-el then the act of pleading the fifth still bears witness by implicitly stating he must actually be Kal-el, thus the only way to protect him from having to reveal the truth is by allowing him to plead the fifth even if he isn't actually Kal-el without this being considered lying to the court.  Obviously you therefore can't force him to reveal the actual identity of Kal-el without implicitly forcing him to bear witness against himself as to whether or not he is this individual.  Does this argument work?","answer":"No. The Fifth Amendment provides limited protection that gives you some ability to not answer police questions about where you were at a specific point in time, if you can identity a piece of evidence, etc. It also allows you to avoid testifying in court if the testimony would also incriminate you. Clark Kent, if he were a reporter, could try and claim First Amendment protection to protect Kal'el's identity, but simply being accused of being somebody isn't a crime, and therefore wouldn't be subject to Fifth Amendment protections.Even under the First Amendment, a court could subpoena Clark Kent and force him to reveal the identity of Kal'el; failure to do so results in a contempt in court charge, including possible jail time, fines, or both. However, they couldn't generally make Clark Kent answer any questions about Kal'el's activities if they could possibly lead to a conviction of Clark Kent. For example, he could refuse to testify in court, or choose not to answer questions about where he was on the night of the 25th, if they could cause him to be self-incriminated."}

{"question":"Many websites have user-specific data tied to their account which the user can view by logging in. For example, Amazon tracks a user's purchase history, Netflix tracks a user's watch history, etc. Typically that user can view this data if they login to their own account.Sometimes one service provider (ex: Google) provides a specific secure way for a user to grant access to his data to other sites (ex: via an OAUTH API). So, a user could allow a separate website to read his Gmail contact list.Not all websites have a built-in way to do this. I have seen some websites which work around this by asking for the username\/password to the separate website and they do scraping behind the scenes on behalf of the user to get their data.Obviously the user is putting themselves at a higher security risk by choosing to do this, but they might not care about the security implications & might like the convenience of having their data auto-imported into the 2nd website.In USA, is this legal if the user has given their username & password to the website #2 & specifically granted them the right to scrape their user data from website #1 on their behalf? Or would it fall under the PrivacyPolicy\/TermsOfUse of website #1?I know the CFAA talks about 'unauthorized' access, but it seems confusing whether the user can grant you access or if you also need permission from the website owner.Many PrivacyPolicy\/TermsOfUse warn the user that it's dangerous to share their password, but maybe that's be the users' choice\/risk?I'm assuming something like an order history wouldn't have any Copyright implications. So, I'm not worried about that. I know when a user submits content like messages\/posts the website usually gains copyright of it, however I'm not thinking about scraping this type of data.Assuming the PrivacyPolicy\/TermsOfUse specifically prohibits scraping (or password sharing), what are the potential consequences of ignoring this and doing it anyways?Is there a legal way to work around this without getting specific permission from the website owner?","answer":"Many ToS ban scraping by an automated process: only manual login is allowed. Therefore any scraping is unauthorized and therefore illegal."}
{"question":"Police shows up on a residence's front door, starts encounter with resident. Resident decides to end consensual encounter, and asks officers to leave.Officer decline to leave and put foot on the door frame to stop resident from closing door. Resident insists officer is not welcome and demands them to leave. Officers do not leave. Closing the door or forcing the foot to move probably leads to the famous \"assault on an officer\" charge.Cops claim they have the right to remain on the property without specifying why.What should a reasonable person do in this situation? Call 911 on the cops? Leave the front door open, withdraw deeper into the residence? Keep asking them to leave and state they are not welcome?","answer":"Yes, your best bet for immediate relief is to call 911 and ask for a supervisor. Generally speaking the police are not legally obliged to explain themselves to you on the spot. They are obliged to explain themselves to the courts and their supervisors."}
{"question":"I've seen several times on this site and elsewhere (and on one of ) that when it comes to housing questions\/disputes often it's being asked 'Have you received mail addressed to you at this address ?' Why is that a significant factor ? What does it legally prove or disprove ?Context: US law","answer":"It is legally significant because you have certain protections from eviction is you reside in a place. If you are just a weekend guest (or an uninvited intruder), you don't enjoy tenant privileges and could be arrested by the police for trespassing. Whereas if you have been living in a house for some months, then removing you from your residences is typically a more involved legal procedure. Receiving mail at an address over a period of time is evidence that you reside there."}
{"question":"Lawsuit filed against WHO over its handling of coronavirus outbreak:Selected excerpts from news article:Richard Kling and Steve Rotker of New Rochelle and Gennaro Purchia of  Scarsdale, filed the suit in White Plains federal court Monday and  claimed they suffered 'injury, damage and loss' because of the  outbreak and want the WHO to pay 'incalculable' damages. Steven Blau,  the attorney representing the plaintiffs, argued WHO didn't do enough  to ensure the Chinese government was transparent of its COVID-19  safeguards.'The Chinese government and the WHO intentionally misled the  international community, including the named Plaintiffs, about the  coronavirus and its devastating medical and economic effects,It is unclear which statute is violated.How is it possible for a multinational NGO to be prosecuted for unsuccessfully containing a pandemic?UPDATE:   The lawsuit seeks recovery for the enormous loss of life, human  suffering, and economic turmoil experienced by all Missourians caused  by the coronavirus pandemic. Several defendants are identified,  including the CCP, China's health ministry, the governments of Hubei  province and the city of Wuhan, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The suit claims that these entities were negligent in attempting to  contain the initial outbreak in Wuhan, and that they deceived the  international community as to the prevalence of the outbreak. While  the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 generally prevents  Americans from suing foreign governments in U.S. courts, there are  certain exemptions embodied in the legislation which are targeted in  the lawsuit.","answer":"The Proper DefendantAs a preliminary matter, it would be necessary to determine who the proper defendant was in the case, in order to analyze it further. The World Health Organization (WHO) is probably a different legal entity from the United Nations (UN) itself and merely affiliated with the UN from a legal perspective, rather than being legally considered to be an agency of the UN. So, the WHO rather than the UN would be the proper defendant.Subject Matter JurisdictionFederal courts have limited 'subject matter' jurisdiction and this must always be analyzed before other jurisdictional considerations are considered. But, U.S. District Courts are allowed to adjudicate civil lawsuits where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the defendants are not citizens of the same U.S. state. This is a civil lawsuit, the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, the plaintiffs are citizens of New York State, and the Defendant is not a New York State entity. So, the federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case.VenueVenue is proper in a federal district court if the district court can assert personal jurisdiction over the defendant. A district court, in turn, has personal jurisdiction over any defendant over whom a state court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located would have personal jurisdiction.Note, as an aside, that where none of the events giving rise to the suit took place in the state, and the defendant does not reside in the state, any of the U.S. District Courts in the state is a proper venue, whether or not the Plaintiffs reside there, if the general jurisdiction state courts of the state would have personal jurisdiction over the Defendant.Personal JurisdictionGeneral JurisdictionIt appears that the WHO does not have a permanent office for the conduct of business in the United States (it's headquarters is in Switzerland and none of its regional offices are in the U.S.), although it might have a full time representative at the UN offices in New York City. Therefore, a federal district court in New York State (or a state court in New York State) would probably not have the authority to assert 'general personal jurisdiction' (i.e. jurisdiction over any case against the defendant without regard to how it arose) over the WHO because this is not a 'headquarters' or equivalent permanent office in New York State.Specific JurisdictionTo have 'specific personal jurisdiction' over over the WHO (i.e. arising from the facts of the particular case and limited to that case), the WHO would have to have taken actions directed as someone within the state in which the District Court in question is located which would suffice to personally avail itself of the laws of that state and the United States. Failure to adequately take actions in China for the general benefit of the world, would not suffice to meet that standard. While the injury may have occurred in New York State, the actions alleged did not occur in New York State and were not directed in any particular way to New York State as opposed to anywhere else, and no one is alleging that the WHO intentionally or negligently itself sent coronavirus germs to New York State, even if it may have failed to take certain steps that it had a duty to take, and that failure made the arrival of those germs in New York State possible.Tag JurisdictionA third way to acquire personal jurisdiction in some cases is called 'tag jurisdiction.' 'Tag jurisdiction' provides a court with personal jurisdiction over an individual in a particular case in the state where personal service of process upon that individual took place, without regard to other considerations. But, 'tag jurisdiction' does not apply to entities such as the WHO.Governmental ImmunityMoreover, even if a U.S. District Court did have personal jurisdiction over the WHO, this action would be a 'tort' action and the WHO would also almost certainly have some form of sovereign immunity under U.S. law from a tort action of this type.The relevant U.S. statute is the ). The key provision for purposes of this question is 22 U.S.C.288a(b) which states:  International organizations, their property and their assets, wherever  located, and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy the same immunity from  suit and every form of judicial process as is enjoyed by foreign  governments, except to the extent that such organizations may  expressly waive their immunity for the purpose of any proceedings or  by the terms of any contract.The definition of an International Organization for the purposes of the act is  which provides a general rule protecting international organizations in the absence of an executive order to the contrary. The President may revoke an international organization's immunity prospectively by executive order (except in the case of 13 organizations who are covered by a specific statutory provision; the WHO is not one of them), but neither a private organization nor a U.S. state or local government, may do so. And, an executive order purporting to revoke an organization's immunity retroactively would be void as an ex post facto determination.ConclusionIn summary, then, this lawsuit will very likely be dismissed either for lack of personal jurisdiction, or on account of an immunity from tort liability doctrine, in response to a motion to dismiss, without ever getting any further. It might also be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted on other grounds (e.g. the lack of a legal duty or the lack of plausible allegations sufficient to support the claim that the WHO's actions or inactions were a legal cause of the harm suffered).Footnote Re Legal Basis For The Claim On The Merits  It is unclear which statute is violated.It would be unusual for a claim for personal injury to arise under a statute. Most claims for personal injury are brought on the basis of a common law claim of negligence which would arise from the case law of New York State's state courts in this case (pursuant to the Erie doctrine).A negligence claim has four canonical elements: The existence of a legal duty (normally the legal duty to use reasonable care to refrain from causing injury to others) of the defendant that runs to the plaintiffs.Breach of the legal duty by the defendant.The causation of the damages alleged by the breach of the legal duty by the defendant in a foreseeable manner.Actual damage to the plaintiffs."}
{"question":"If I tell a lie about my US citzenship (I am actually not), but not to a governmental agencies, I get no benefits, and I don't have the purpose to get any benefits from it, what code will specify the consequence? Am I removable?To be more clear, is the sole action of lying illegal, or does lying must be accompanied with benefits in order to be deemed illegal. For example, in US I've heard that forging documents (such as ID) is not always illegal until you actually use them.","answer":"If you falsely claim to be a US citizen in order to obtain work, vote in a US election, or receive public benefits in the United States, you can be deported, lose a green card, or be banned from ever obtaining a green card or US Visa. See  for more detail. This very much includes checking an incorrect box on an I-9 form when obtaining a job, although that is not usually considered a 'benefit'. In fact incorrect I-9 statements are a common source of such bans.However, if a person lies in response to a merely curious question, when no government or private benefit, and no job eligibility is involved, the ban should not, as far as I can see, come into effect, nor should that be grounds for deportation, or indeed any criminal or immigration action.If a person falsely claims to be a US Citizen merely to obtain social status or personal importance or reputation, that would seem not to be a crime under the doctrine of , nor should it lead directly to any immigration consequences, althoguh I suppose it might draw attention to someone who is deportable on other grounds."}
{"question":"My understanding is that corporations and their officers have the fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to stockholders, but not to debtholders.Convertible notes are hybrid instruments; they are debt that is convertible into equity at the option of the holder at a predetermined rate. What level of fiduciary duty does a corporation have to holders of such instruments? That of a debtholder, an equity holder, or some 'hybrid' level.","answer":"The law in the United States would not be uniform on this issue, but generally the officers and directors owe their fiduciary duties to the corporation rather than to the shareholders. The duties owed to shareholders are generally much more limited and context specific (e.g. in relation to distributions or take over offers).The existence of a duty might also depend upon whether or not the notes were in default or the company was insolvent."}
{"question":"I was researching the mass suicides that occurred in cults like .

Suicide is still a crime, as is murder and while many people committed suicide, many also died at at hands of others.

{"question":"I am interested in the law surrounding jurors. During juror selection (voir dire) a potential jurors can be asked questions to determine their suitability to serve on the jury. Is it ever legal for a juror to refuse to answer any question? Could one, for example, 'plead the fifth'?","answer":"Yes, there are cases where refusing to respond to the question would be legal. The juror could plead the fifth \u2013 so long as he hasn't spilled the beans about what he is trying to protect \u2013 which provides for the protection from compelled self-incrimination (any incriminating statement that could be used against you in a criminal charge \u2013 civil liability doesn't count here). Anything that is said in voir dire is on the record and under oath. You are effectively witnessing against yourself.As stated on :Witnesses can assert the privilege against self-incrimination in civil proceedings as well as criminal ones, despite the seemingly limiting language of the Fifth Amendment. They can assert it in state or federal court, in a wide variety of proceedings (including trials, depositions, administrative law proceedings, and investigatory proceedings like grand jury hearings).. . .If, by answering, the witness could provide evidence that might aid the government in prosecuting him, then he has the right to refuse.There has to be evidence, though, that testimony would subject you to criminal charges. &quot;What is your hair color?&quot; obviously cannot subject you to criminal charges. &quot;Have you ever driven while intoxicated?&quot; Would only be incriminating while the Statute of Limitations has not passed. After that point, you have not 5th amendment protections for having driven under the influence because it will no longer subject you to criminal charges.Additionally, there are cases in which you could refuse to answer but the court could still compel you to answer. For instance, sometimes questions in voir dire get very personal. If jurors believe a question is too personal, they can try to refuse to answer on those grounds, let the judge know, and the judge would make the decision. If the judge decides they must answer, and they continued to refuse, the judge could hold them in contempt.On a slightly more practical note, if you are objecting to questions, it will impact whether the attorneys on either side will allow you to stay on as a juror. After an objection to a specific question, the attorney may just decide to nix you."}

{"question":"Judges and juries are supposed to be impartial. Jurors are removed all the time for being potentially biased towards one side in a case.A judge in a case that is a current event as of writing , has been accused by much of the media and other observers as being biased, in this case towards the defendant.Can a judge be forced to recuse themself from a trial for credible accusations of bias? If so, what are the processes the defense or prosecution can take to do so?","answer":"A party can ask a judge to recuse at the outset of a case for bias or other reasons (e.g. a family connection to a party). Generally, a judge rules on that motion personally and it is an interlocutory motion not subject to appeal except by extraordinary writ (or the equivalent) to the state supreme court.It is not generally proper to do so during a trial.Moreover, one jeopardy has attached in a criminal trial (which happens when the jury is sworn) if the trial ends prior to a jury verdict for reasons other than those attributable to the defendant, the defendant cannot be tried again on those charges and is functionally acquitted.There are probably some arguable exceptions to this rule in extraordinary circumstances that are not the fault of either party (e.g. if a meteor hits courthouse and kills the judge and some jurors mid-trial, or if it is revealed that the judge committed the crime for which the defendant is being tried). But the threshold for exceptions to the general rule is very high."}

Like, for example, if they had a neighbours' feud or otherwise disliked each other?On the one hand, such a question would not be relevant to the matter. On the other hand, Dan's lawyer could say it pertains to Wayne's bias and credibility, which is generally allowed on cross-examination.Would the threshold be met? Can Dan's lawyer ask those questions merely because Wayne is Dan's neighbour? Or would he need to know of something more specific between Dan and Wayne?Also, can Dan's lawyer just ask Wayne if he had any criminal history \/ convictions? Normally the state prosecutor will have access to this info and have to provide it to the defence. But in some cases (e.g. private prosecution) this info is not available unless the witness releases it.(Any jurisdiction where laws about this are\/derived from common law)","answer":"In the United States, this would be pretty uncontroversial as a legal matter. A witness's bias speaks to his credibility, and the general rule is that a witness's credibility is always relevant.Dan would therefore have a reasonable amount of freedom to make inquiries into these matters, but he can probably expect the judge to shut it down before too long if he doesn't have any basis for suggesting a credibility issue and the questioning isn't revealing anything, either.I wouldn't necessarily expect a court to find it objectionable to ask about the specific issues you've raised, either. If there have been neighbor disputes, Dan is entitled to let the jury know. The court would likely allow an inquiry into Wayne's criminal record, as well, though it would probably be limited to questions about crimes that are admissible under .As a tactical matter, though, this approach can be risky, and I think most lawyers would not recommend it. The general rule is that at trial, you don't ask a witness a question that you don't know the answer to. Opening up this line of questioning blind could go wrong in several ways. Dan could ask Wayne fifty questions about his credibility, but if there's nothing there, all Dan has done is make Wayne look more credible. Alternatively, the lawyer could ask Wayne if he has any criminal record, and he could answer, &quot;Oh yes. Dan and I were convicted for trying unsuccessfully to kill Alice a couple years ago.&quot; Not a great answer."}

Some states explicitly exclude university dormitories, but that seems not to be the case in CA. There are some specific exclusions where dormitories are excluded (such as 1946.2 regarding termination), so the lack of an exclusion for dormitories can't follow from an assumption that a dormitory is not a residential dwelling unit. Clearly, a normal apartment that happens to be owned by the university and is rented out to students (as exist in many universities) clearly is an ordinary rental. So it seems that a dormitory is not legally exempted from 1954: they can only enter with permission or in specific circumstances."}

{"question":"Is there a law or regulation that prevents the use of dogs to detect the coronavirus at airports in the United States ? Do other countries have laws like these which block the use of dogs?","answer":"The issue is more likely that there is no law or regulation allowing the use of dogs to sniff passengers in the US for matters not related to crime, whereas Dubai, a monarchy, has a different political system. In general, you have the constitutional right to move about in the U and the right not to be unreasonably seized, a right which may not exist in some other jurisdictions. That right can be restricted in accordance with law, but there has to be some such law. It is not a crime to have covid, or to travel while infected (it is a crime to carry bombs and drugs on a plane).One area where there is some restriction is where there always has been a restriction, namely entry into the US. There is (was)  indicates the airport restrictions, but does not explain what screening will take place. The above DHS site says that &quot;the passenger will be asked about their medical history, current condition, and asked for contact information for local health authorities. Passengers will then be given written guidance about COVID-19 and directed to their final destination, and immediately home-quarantine in accordance with CDC best practices&quot;. It is not clear whether a mandatory temperature check without even reasonable suspicion of a crime would constitute an unreasonable search (body searches are subject to higher standards than property searches, it seems), and constitutional law surrounding searches has emphasized the primacy of privacy in search law, not the fact of physically entering property of the body. Some airlines and airports offer voluntary temperature checking, so it might be possible if someone has a covid-sniffing dog to offer voluntary sniff testing, especially if it is offered by a private concern and does not have the appearance of government mandate (which would require a law)."}

{"question":"The business is incorporated offshore. It is a company selling software applications.

If the owner runs the company in U.S. without being an employee or getting salary, does he have to pay any tax?","answer":"The company probably owes U.S. and state corporate income taxes because income from services performed in the United States are usually considered 'effectively connected' with the United States. The fact that the servers are located in the U.S. is pretty much irrelevant, relative to the fact that the services are performed while located in the United States. I can't think of a single tax case that has ever turned on the location of the servers in a company.Unlike a U.S. company, a foreign company is not taxed by the U.S. on its worldwide income, nor is the individual, a non-resident alien (having an F-1 visa rather than a green card) taxes on the individual's worldwide income. But, a non-U.S. person is still taxed on income that is effectively connected with the United States.Generally speaking income from property is not effectively connected with the United States merely because it is managed by someone located in the U.S., so if the company had owned an apartment in Brazil that it received rental income from, for example, that would not be subject to U.S. taxation.Also income from intangible property (like interest payments on loans or dividends on publicly held stock) is generally not subject to U.S. taxation if paid to a non-resident, non-citizen of the U.S.But, generally speaking, income from the performance of services is taxable in the place where the services are performed. For example, Colorado can impose state income taxes on income earned by a Texas baseball player while playing at a stadium in Denver.The lack of a salary or employee status shouldn't change the fact that the income received by the company from performance of services in the U.S. is effectively connected with the United States. When the owner performs services in the U.S., the company is performing services in the U.S. and so it is subject to taxation in the U.S.Dividend payments from the offshore company probably wouldn't be subject to U.S. taxation in this scenario, but the company itself would be subject to corporate income taxes in the U.S. from the profits it earned from the services performed in the U.S."}

Using a mariage certificate in another state doesn't seem to be possible in most states.Does this make the mariage void or voidable?Is it legal now that they've lived together for 8 years?Is there any criminal liability in supplying this faulty information to the state?","answer":"The specific venue requirement is  which says thatEach of the persons seeking a marriage license shall personally appearin the probate court within the county where either resides, or, ifneither is a resident of this state, where the marriage is expected tobe solemnized. If neither party is a resident of this state, themarriage may be solemnized only in the county where the license isobtained.To possibly make things worse,An applicant for a marriage license who knowingly makes a falsestatement in an application or affidavit prescribed by this section isguilty of falsification under section 2921.13 of the Revised Code.If they lied on the application regarding the venue, that's a large problem. Otherwise, violating 3101.05 is a minor misdemeanor, which could be a fine up to $150. There is no provision that would invalidate the marriage, other than specified prohibited marriages (not nearer of kin than second cousin, already married)."}
{"question":"In my state of Massachusetts, before being able to purchase any firearms, you must obtain a Firearms Identification (FID) license or a License to Carry (LTC).Suppose that someone is in the process for applying for an FID, which according to our general law () is a \"shall issue\" license.Suppose that this person was born in Germany and immigrated to the United States at a very young age. Once the applicant's parents obtained citizenship through naturalization, the applicant was also given citizenship because s\/he was under 18 and their child. The applicant's clearest proof of citizenship is having a US passport.A town official tells the applicant that because s\/he was born in Germany, they required a certificate of naturalization. When asked if a passport would be accepted instead, the police officer strangely stated that it could not be accepted because a passport has an expiry date. Furthermore, the  states:For a Firearms Identification Permit (FID):...A naturalized citizen within the above age restrictions (applicant must present proof of naturalization); and   ...There is the option of filing for a Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600), however the average processing time for these applications is over a year. Everyone has a right to bear arms guaranteed by the second amendment and this is a \"shall issue\" firearms license. It seems quite insane to me that a person would need proof of naturalization despite being a US citizen.Is this legal? Can the applicant do anything besides applying for an N-600?","answer":"The police are mistaken because they don't understand immigration law.Usually, the first step to resolve this problem would be to explain the situation in a letter to or telephone call with the town attorney, elevating it from a police officer who has no training in citizenship and naturalization paperwork, to an attorney, who should either know better, or should be able to find out more easily."}
{"question":"I'm thinking of using a virtual mailbox like this to get mail for an LLC I'm starting:It will prevent me having to put my home address on the articles of origination for the llc formation. Also, if I use my home address, Orange County FL requires me to get the landlord's signature for a business license and that won't work.Is that all okay, for example:Can I use a virtual address on the physical and mailing address onthe articles of origination?Can I use my virtual address on thecounty\/city tax receipt (aka business license) or will they rejectit?Will a bank not work with me over this when I need anaccount\/credit card?","answer":"Can I use a virtual mailbox on the physical and mailing address on anLLC's the articles of origination?No.This is governed by  which states in the pertinent part that:(2)?The articles of organization must state the following:(a)?The name of the limited liability company, which must comply withs. 605.0112.(b)?The street and mailing addresses of the company's principaloffice.(c)?The name, street address in this state, and written acceptance ofthe company's initial registered agent.So, you need a real life street address that is actually the street address of the principal offices of the business and the actual street address of the registered agent, which must be in the state of Florida.if I use my home address, Orange County FL requires me to get thelandlord's signature for a business license and that won't work.I am skeptical that this is the case. The requirement of a business license under local law, and the requirement to provide an address for state article of organization purposes is usually not the same. Business license requirements would only rarely apply to home based businesses that do not involve in person customer\/vendor\/employee contact at that location.Can I use a virtual address on the physical and mailing address on thearticles of origination?No.Can I use my virtual address on the county\/city tax receipt (akabusiness license) or will they reject it?I don't know. It would depend upon the tax regulations for that locality.Will a bank not work with me over this when I need an account\/creditcard?A bank is ordinarily happy to use any address you provide them with if their economic requirements are met and the LLC is validly formed and has a taxpayer ID number from the IRS. Often a bank will need a &quot;certificate of good standing&quot; from the state secretary of state, affirming that the entity has not been dissolved and is current on its filing fees."}

{"question":"Currently there is an  promotion going on, where the applicant can receive a three-month lasting free trial of Discord Nitro subscription.Now obviously, as many companies do nowadays, they require a credit card to redeem the offer. I searched for a credit card on YouTube, and I found one video where a Nigerian man showed his PayPal Business Debit Mastercard and specifically said You can do whatever you want with it, send the money to different countries, different places.If that is the rightful owner, he did consent to the public of it being used for any purposes. The debit card still had the Activate Your Card with the PayPal app sticker, so potentially it could be not activated. I am aware that PayPal may have terms of them prohibiting any kinds of sharing their services' credentials.The video was later taken down by YouTube for violating community guidelines by sharing billing information on the site. I have downloaded the video and the video itself is a proof that the information was not used against his will (again if that is the rightful owner).Also, it is a free trial, which will not renew since I cancelled the renewal and removed the billing information afterwards (a day later when I found out that is possible).Did I violate any laws, and can I face any charges or in the worst case, go to prison?I should also clarify that I am a minor as now (16 years old).","answer":"Discord can ban you from their platformWhile you are not in  of any law or contract with the credit card company Discord are likely to be unhappy that your activity caused them to be in breach with the card company.Discord has absolute discretion under their  to ban you for any or no reason.

{"question":"Many older books printed for the UK market (most notably The Great Gatsby) had text on the back cover resembling the following:For copyright reasons this book is not for sale in the U.S.A.Under , I'm pretty sure this has no legal meaning in the US any more, but I have some questions:What was the historical basis for this notice?Is this notice indeed legally void in the United States under Kirtsaeng (assuming the book was lawfully acquired in the UK or its territories)? In other works, could I legally sell such a book in the US?","answer":"  What was the historical basis for this notice?This is a hypothesis but a likely one: . The market in the US was willing to pay more for textbooks than the UK market is and the publisher makes greater profits as a result. This is more likely in the case you cite.For older publications it is usually because different publishers were licensed by the rights holder in different jurisdictions. The 'multi-national' corporation is a largely late 20th century creation, particularly in book publishing. Also, prior to the 1990s the US was not a signatory to the Berne Convention on copyright: during the late 19th and early 20th century the US was regarded as something of an IP 'pirate' nation.  Is this notice indeed legally void in the United States under Kirtsaeng (assuming the book was lawfully acquired in the UK or its territories)? In other works, could I legally sell such a book in the US?It is legally void to the extent that it contravenes the , that is a copyright owner cannot enforce their rights on a physical copy once it is legally no longer their property. However, there is a growing trend to licence copies rather than sell them  - in such a case the first sale doctrine is not relevant - the ownership of the physical copy never passes from the copyright owner. Such rights can also be waived in a contract, however, in such a case the cause of action is breach of contract not breach of copyright."}
{"question":"I have been doing some research on the cannabis industry over the past couple of months, and from what I have been reading it is a consistently growing market, and the barriers to entry are now becoming lower, thanks to various U.S. states making the substance legal, as well as the decriminalization of cannabis.One pain point that I have seen come up often is that there isn't a reliable payment processor for the sale of cannabis and cannabis derivatives. Large banks usually decline transactions for cannabis payments, and there are many hoops to jump through. This sounds like a a huge opportunity if a solution can be found, but as I was reading more on the legalities of cannabis payment processors, it gave me pause. While multiple cannabis payment processors do exist, there are some very gray areas with how these processors are able to process payments, some bordering on illegal.It would be great if it can be explained whether creating a cannabis payment processor can be legally done in the United States. Currently, large companies that deal with financial transactions (Stripe, Master Card, Visa, the big banks) reject or prohibit cannabis transactions.","answer":"The practical problem is that cannabis is still illegal under Federal lawAs such, anyone who deals with it, including as a payment processer must operate entirely within a State where it is legal to avoid falling under the interstate commerce jurisdiction of the Federal government.For a payment processor, that means staying off the internet and the telephone system since these are inherently interstate (and arguably international) and not using the Post Office. It also means not processing payments to or from residents of states outside the one they operate in. It also means not using any interstate based payment companies like MasterCard or Visa or Paypall.Which basically leaves cash or some form of ad-hoc IOU system that's settled by cash. In which case, you don't offer much in the way of value-add to the retailer, do you? They can just do that themselves."}
{"question":"Are math questions copyrightable? I am thinking it is, but to what extent and what are the limitations? Because some question like 2+2 are too basic to be copyrightable, but some other mathematics question in calculus 1, 2 and 3 are easily copyrightable, or at least should or might have to be. I am asking, because some people may copy other people's questions and put them in their text or textbook.","answer":"At some point, a word problem that expresses an underlying mathematical problem that could be posed in many different ways, could be subject to copyright. But some word problems that are effectively unique (e.g. derive Kepler's laws from Newton's law of gravity) could probably not be copyrighted, and others would be, as you note, too basic to have any creative or original element to them.Likewise, stylistic aspects of the presentation that aren't necessary by mathematical convention (e.g. presenting all advanced questions in boxes with borders in large print blue type) could be entitled to copyright protection.Further, merely having identical questions doesn't prove a copyright violation. You have to prove in an infringement action that one question was derived from the other question (e.g. by showing that the alleged infringer had the textbook allegedly copied and carried over typos into their edition). Usually, showing derivation is trivial, but in a case like this one, it might be hard to show."}
{"question":"If company X wants to find out information about company Y's online product, is it illegal for X to hire a contractor to pose as a customer using false details? Assuming no documents are signed, has fraud or any other offense been committed if the contractor gains access to non-public information (or to Y's product itself) if company Y would not have provided that access knowing the contractor was affiliated with company X? If so, who is the guilty party?","answer":"Online versus brick and mortar does not matter. It sounds like fraud. First, you are knowingly making a false representation of fact, and this is a material fact (that is, it matters to the other party whether you are a customer or not). Your falsehood is intended to get the other part to act on that false representation, and providing this information injures the other party.  gives an overview of the elements of fraud. Signatures are not required for there to be fraud. It is not illegal to pose as a company's customer: it is illegal do so in order to get something that they would not have otherwise provided."}
{"question":"If I got arrested 2 years ago but the case was never picked up and never got the chance to see the judge because the state didnt press charges and the person never pressed charges will it still show up on my background?  I went to the. Courthouse to get a background check and they said I have nothing and if I was arrested 2 yrs ago it was never filed. What does that mean?","answer":"There is probably a record of your arrest which would show up in a background search (although the jurisdiction in question, i.e. the country, or sub-division of a country such as a U.S. state in countries organized on a federal basis, would matter).Generally, a failure to seek criminal charges does not mean that there is no record of your arrest. The courthouse is often not the bureaucratic entity that maintains arrest records. In many jurisdictions, arrest records (unlike records of criminal charges and criminal convictions) are maintained by law enforcement rather than the courts.Whether it is possible to have arrest records sealed is a separate and more complicated and jurisdiction specific question."}
{"question":"For example, if I apply for a patent in U.S. will my rights over the intellectual property be held only in the U.S. or I could also claim my rights over an IP in some other nation, like India?  Also, do I have to apply for patents in individual nations?","answer":"IP rights are territorial in nature. If patent is filed in US, then rights associated with the patent can be enforced only in US. In case your wish to enforce rights in other countries, you must file application in your countries of interest."}
{"question":"In the actual  case, the conviction of the investment banker was overturned by an appeallate court, because the trial judge had wrongly instructed the jury to disregard 'mens rea' (guilty knowledge) in ordering the destruction of documents.Suppose, in I call a 'reverse Quattrone' case, the jury found that the defendant had mens rea in ordering the destruction of documents in an . But the prosecution was unable to prove the relevance of the documents in question because they had been destroyed.Could an American jury still find guilt based on its finding of mens rea? That is, the jury thinks, 'we don't know what this guy is hiding, but he sure must be hiding something?","answer":"In a criminal case, a jury is required to find that all of the elements of the crime are present beyond a reasonable doubt. Mens rea is one element of most crimes, but is almost never the only one that the prosecution must prove.A jury does not need to have direct proof of each of those elements. Some or all of them may be established with circumstantial evidence. But, it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that every element is true. So, in a 'reverse Quattrone' case, a jury that was faithfully following the jury instructions given to it would have to acquit the defendant on that charge."}
{"question":"Both Katie Hill and Hulk Hogan are public figures - both had private images involuntarily published.  Both cases were consensual relations.  However in Hill's case she violated job regulations having sexual relations with a subordinate, for which she resigned.Hulk Hogan was  to be paid by Gawker.Katie Hill was  to the Daily Mail and RedState, journals who published the sexual pictures.As a layman the cases don't look so different to me.  What are the legal reasons (claims, laws) resulting in the outcomes being so different?Here is a , containing the exception mentioned by @StuartF in the comments.(c) (1) A person is not liable under this section in either of the following circumstances:...B) The material is any of the following:(i) A matter of legitimate public concern.(ii) A work of political or newsworthy value or similar work.(iii) Commentary, criticism, or disclosure that is otherwise protected by the California Constitution or the United States Constitution.@I?akiViggers mention possibility of appeal.  I found this month old article (before the latest judgement which Hill lost) At the time, Hill's lawyer indicated they would appeal the case to the appellate court. But USC Professor Michael Overing who specializes in censorship and First Amendment issues, defamation, legal communication and internet law, said the former congresswoman does not have many legal options left.She's got a tremendous uphill battle. This is one of the times where the first amendment is going to give real protection to any of the publications because it's newsworthy, Overing said. The information is accurate; it's truthful and we don't have grounds to suppress it.","answer":"Generally speaking, in cases of defamation, there is a exception for information that is &quot;in the public interest&quot;, which does not necessarily mean information that the public wishes to know, but rather information the public needs to know in order to maintain the &quot;public good&quot;, such as there being an informed electorate.At first glance, the difference in the public interest in the materially similar information in the two cases is starkly contrasting, simply because of the professions of the two plaintiffs, as well as their relationships with their &quot;recording partners&quot; (for lack of a better term).In the first case, Terry Gene Bollea was victorious, as he was working as an entertainer, under the stagename &quot;Hulk Hogan&quot;, and his companion was the wife of a fellow entertainer. From the perspective of the public good, this is not worthwhile information.In the second case, there are two reasons the reported information falls into the domain of the public interest. Firstly, Hill was a serving Federal Congressional Representative, so she is automatically a person of public interest.Secondly, as noted, it violated the norms of her position, and lead to her investigation by the House Ethics Committee and her resignation. There is an intentionally large hole in US defamation law for governmental figures, and especially their wrongdoing.Whether or not the report was politically motived or not, exposing the wrongdoing of government figures is one of the major reasons for freedom of the press; Benjamin Franklin himself got into legal trouble for doing similarly. As a result, US defamation law has much larger protections for news reports on governmental figures."}
{"question":"Suppose you are accused of something that doesn't make sense or shouldn't be placed on you based on jurisdiction, and decide with your retained defense attorney to file a motion to dismiss those charges.If the government has already offered you a plea offer quite early on, with no jail time\/small fine, can they make that offer less favorable just because you filed that motion? They were annoyed and 'mad' that you've bothered to file a motion, so they screw you over with an increased sentence? ","answer":"A prosecutor has very broad discretion to offer and rescind a plea agreement, subject to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure  gathers together sources that have studied the effect of this discretion. If you reject an offer, then the offer isn't there anymore. Either side can withdraw from a bargain until the judge accepts it."}
{"question":"One hundred years ago, if you said that \"Miss X is not a virgin,\" when in fact she was, that would be grounds for a defamation suit. The reason is that because 80%+ of unmarried American adult women were, in fact, such (before the advent of the \"Pill\" in the 1960s).Someone made the observation, \"today, you would more likely be sued for defamation if you alleged (wrongly) that Ms. X IS a virgin,\" implying that she is sexually inexperienced. The issue is that 90%+ of unmarried adult women are not virgins today.One way of interpreting the above is that a statement that \"Ms. X is a virgin\" would not be \"highly offensive to a reasonable person.\" That is, you are praising Ms. X for her \"chastity.\"But another way of looking at it is that you are alleging, in 2021, that Ms. X is deviating from the prevailing norm by being a virgin, whereas in 1921, NOT being a virgin would represent a deviation from the norm.Would alleging that someone was \"out of line\" with prevailing norms in the above fashion be grounds for defamation even though these norms have changed over time?","answer":"The definition of defamation, itself, doesn't change. What may change is whether certain kinds of false statements are &quot;so bad&quot; that it is not necessary to prove that the person was actually damaged by the statement, i.e. is defamation per se.  this isCharges any person with crime, or with having been indicted, convicted, or punished for crime;Imputes in him the present existence of an infectious, contagious, or loathsome disease;Tends directly to injure him in respect to his office, profession, trade or business, either by imputing to him general disqualificationin those respects which the office or other occupation peculiarlyrequires, or by imputing something with reference to his office,profession, trade, or business that has a natural tendency to lessenits profits;Imputes to him impotence or a want of chastity;Hence, being falsely claimed to be a virgin is not defamation per se, but if you can show that you were actually damaged by the claim then you can be compensated for those damages. This is long-standing law ( 114 Cal. 266), which makes it difficult to erode in lieu of a change in statutory language (as in the case of the California Civil Code, amended in 1948). (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 377 provides a loophole, thatthe reader of a libel will recognize it as such. If no reasonablereader would perceive in a false and unprivileged publication ameaning which tended to injure the subject's reputation in any of theenumerated respects, then there is no libel at all. If such a readerwould perceive a defamatory meaning without extrinsic aid beyond hisor her own intelligence and common sense, then (under section 45a andthe cases, such as MacLeod, which have construed it) there is a libelper se. But if the reader would be able to recognize a defamatorymeaning only by virtue of his or her knowledge of specific facts andcircumstances, extrinsic to the publication, which are not matters ofcommon knowledge rationally attributable to all reasonable persons,then (under the same authorities) the libel cannot be libel per se butwill be libel per quod.A &quot;reasonable&quot; reader would not recognize a claim of non-virginity as having a defamatory meaning, but would likely recognize being a professional incompetent as having a defamatory meaning.In other words, even false statements statutorily listed as being potential defamation per se will be subject to a &quot;reasonable man&quot; test: but proving actual damage is still an option."}
{"question":"As reported, What determines which state(s) the Dominion v. Fox case is tried?","answer":"The defendant Fox corporation (there are a variety of affiliated or formerly affiliated companies with very similar names) is organized under the laws of Delaware so lawsuits related to its activities anywhere in the world may be brought in that forum. This choice of venue denied Fox any means of contesting jurisdiction or venue.Also, the Delaware courts have a great level of expertise in handling litigation involving publicly held corporations. While this may not have been very important for a jury trial on the merits itself, this expertise was quite relevant in the pre-trial discovery phase of the trial which alleged widespread misconduct by the inner circle of a publicly held company's employees and officers."}

During school when everyone stands up to say the pledge of allegiance I proudly declare \"I pledge allegiance to the flag ....

My pledging to Satan would likely also be construed as potentially disruptive behavior, but I would presume that would not outweigh the protection of speech\/religion afforded by the 1st amendment?If I wouldn't get protection of religion on the grounds that a belief in Satan isn't a 'firmly held belief' of mine you could always replace Satan in this example with Allah, Jehovah, Shiva, Odin, Flying Spaghetti Monster etc.","answer":"Your school can compel you to pray, if it is a private school. I assume you are asking about a government school. As a limited public forum, the school can limit content (can forbid discussion of a topic), but cannot limit viewpoint (cannot allow only pro-abortion speech while prohibiting anti-abortion speech). If they allow the Godly pledge, they must allow the Satanic pledge (as well as allowing silence). See , 533 U.S. 98. &quot;The power to so restrict speech, however, is not without limits. The restriction must not discriminate against speech based on viewpoint, and must be reasonable in light of the forum's purpose&quot;.While it is true that schools are allowed to limit disruptive behavior, declaring &quot;disruption!&quot; does not automatically suspend the First Amendment. A reasonable person would not find find replacing a few word to be a disruption.

{"question":"Why do police use a battering ram without first checking the doorknob on a low threat warrant? What if a small child was on the other side of the door and got seriously injured by the battering ram? The door and frame is likely to be damaged and may cost hundreds of dollars to replace but there is a small chance someone could also get injured.I have seen where the landlord will let police in with a search warrant with 0 damage but in other cases they can devastate the house breaking and rummaging with a near 0 regard the property and tenants personal items. Can the landlord sue for damages? Are police above criminal law for destruction of property in this matter when they don't at least try the unlocked door?I understand that some damages in court could be argued as previous damage or damages needed for entry but what if you can prove it was intentional and unwarranted with no reason?","answer":"The police officers themselves are covered by ).  However, a search\/seizure doesn't give the police license for arbitrary destruction, whatever they do has to be reasonably pursuant to the legal search\/seizure.  For example, if a suspect is barricaded in a house with a gun, they can knock down doors, windows and walls to apprehend them.  On the other hand, that does not mean the officers can then break open safes to try and find evidence - once their probable cause for the entry is fulfilled (apprehending the suspect), they need to get a warrant to do more than a plain sight search of the house.  Warrants will specify what items are being searched for, so even with a warrant the police have to take reasonable measures to carry it out - an example of an unreasonable measure would be to tear into walls in order to try and find a stolen bicycle.  On the other hand, tearing into walls could be justified if their warrant included searching for drugs from a dealer, where it is not uncommon to hide them in the walls.States and the Federal Government enjoy  from suits in most cases.  There are some exceptions, but none would apply in this case so long as the general policy of the police department was not illegal or unconstitutional.  However, county and city governments do not enjoy Sovereign Immunity and state governments and the Federal Government often allow suits against them for negligence from their actors, so someone injured by unreasonable police action can usually try to recover damages from the officer's department."}
{"question":"I'm a US citizen and marrying my Korean fiancee. We're working on immigrations forms and have a quick question about form I-130 'Petition for Alien Relative', Question number 14:  (Question Marks in the Date Arrived field because it's the field we're unsure of.)14: If your relative (My fiancee, soon to be spouse) is currently in the U.S., complete the following:He or she arrived as a: [ Student ]Arrival\/Departure Record (I-94): [ The Number ]Date Arrived: [ ????-??-?? ]This is confusing us because of a trip we made to Canada last year. During the trip, we crossed the land border at Niagara Falls when leaving and returning to the US.However, when we look up her I-94 travel history (), it notes a Departure for the date we entered Canada, but it doesn't show an Arrival for the date we returned to the US. Additionally, the 'Point of Entry\/Exit' is blank for that departure.The DHS site has a footnote that makes us feel both more and less confused: The following travel may not be reflected: land border arrivals\/departures [. . .]So we have one main question and one related question:What do we enter in the 'Date Arrived' field?The first date she entered the US?The most recent date she entered the US from South Korea?

{"question":"This statute reads:Whoever falsely and willfully represents himself to be a citizen of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.There is no restriction on whom or for what purpose the misrepresentation is made. For example, the following situation might occur: an American is considering whether to buy a house, so they talk to their prospective neighbours to ascertain the character of the neighbourhood. One of them claims to have born in Kansas and lived in the US for their entire life. After the American moves in, they discover that their neighbour lied and was an alien all along. The alien is convicted under 18 USC911.The federal courts upheld a conviction under the predecessor of this statute in .However, in the decades since WWII, the Supreme Court has greatly expanded the scope of First Amendment free speech protections, so one might wonder whether the conviction in the hypothetical situation described above would still be held constitutional.","answer":"There is, of course, no way to tell how the Court would deal with such a case today. This is not a frequently litigated issue, with lots of case law. I note that in the case you link to, the court limited the statute to false claims made 'with a fraudulent purpose'. This normally means that the claimant is attempting to secure an improper financial or materiel advantage. In the  United States v. Tandaric case, the person convicted had falsely claimed to be a US Citizen on an employment application for a company which did not hire non-citizens, and so gained a job through this false statement. He could have been convicted of ordinary Fraud. The court has not been as protective of Fraud under the First Amendment as it has been of speech generally, or even of false but non-fraudulent speech. I am not at all sure if the court would overturn this law in a similar case today. Edit: In the United States v. Achtner case, the court wrote:  But we agree with the District Court that the representation of citizenship must still be made to a person having some right to inquire or adequate reason for ascertaining a defendant's citizenship; it is not to be assumed that so severe a penalty is intended for words spoken as a mere boast or jest or to stop the prying of some busybody, ...This  seems to dispose of the example in the question of a neighbor who is merly inquiring as to the character of the area, or perhaps from simple curiosity, and a false speaker who seems to get no direct benefit or advantage from the falsehood. Both linked cases involved false statements made to employers or potential employees, during wartime at that, with the false speaker's employment apparently at stake. "}

What processes would these institutions accept as proper to change the name of the United States of America?","answer":"Since the name 'United States of America' is found (without formal establishment or definition) in the Declaration of Independence, and it pervades the Constitution, a statute establishing a different name for the country would probably be insufficient.

He appears to have a mental disorder.  What would be the appropriate place to report this to? Thank you!","answer":"Normally, immigration officials wouldn't be involved in a case like this one.Normally, criminal court actions are only effective if the defendant can be arrested by a country where the crime was committed or where the crime was directed, or by a country that will extradite the individual following a request made through diplomatic channels.One way to get there would be to complain to police where the person is located. If you know precisely who it is, and where the person is, this might produce action since someone like that might be a threat the local police care about on the theory that this person might be dangerous to other people as well. Unfortunately, the cases where you are most like to have this information (e.g. stalking and harassment from an ex-spouse or lover) are the cases that local law enforcement where the offender is located is likely to take least seriously.Another would be to complain to a law enforcement agency (e.g. the FBI) that is able to get the attention of diplomats to bring charges and request extradition, in cases where extradition is available (which depends upon the laws of the offender's country, normally this is only available if the offense would be a felony in the place where the offender is located).As a practical matter, the nature of the conduct would have to be pretty intense and amount to some sort of terroristic threat before action was taken criminally through diplomatic extradition channels.Normally, a civil action is only effective if the person to be bound by the order is served with process issued by a court that can have jurisdiction over the individual. Typically, U.S. law would give U.S. courts jurisdiction over wrongful conduct directed at Americans, but if the individual involved is not in the U.S. enforcing the order of a U.S. court might be difficult.In a domestic situation, one would seek a restraining order or protection order against the offending individual. This could be useful if that person later appears in the U.S., but getting service of process on that individual could be hard.It might be possible to get an order from a U.S. court applying to the online entity facilitating the harassment by the foreign person to censor that person, but you end up with a whack-a-mole situations where getting an order is hard and as soon as one is obtained the offender can move to another online means of conducting harassment or can operate under an alias that can't definitively be tied to the original offender.Also what constitutes &quot;horribly stalked and harassed online&quot; is too vague to know if the conduct would constitute action for which a criminal or civil remedy is available. Likewise, it is unclear who certain you are about the identity or location of the offending individual. No legal action is possible without clarity of both of these things.Bottom line: From a practical perspective, you are pretty much limited to self-help, defensive measures (locking doors, not being alone, not giving out privacy disclosing information) that cramp your life, and to complaints to the administrators of the online forums where this conduct happens."}
{"question":"I along with a few other people are curious as to the legality of scenarios logically similar to the hypothetical described below:Assume someone places their wallet on the ground in a public place, then someone picks up the wallet thinking it was theirs's, puts money in it, then leaves it on the ground and proceeds to walk away leaving the wallet on the ground. Then, at a later time, the owner of the wallet who originally left it on the ground in a public place comes over and picks up their wallet, and notices that for some odd reason someone decided to put money inside of their wallet that was left in a public place. Can the owner of the wallet keep the money that was put in their wallet? Or would it be illegal to take the money being that the person (not the owner of the wallet) who put the money in the wallet wasn't planning on giving it away? Or would the law state that because the wallet was in a public place at the time of the person putting money in the wallet, the person that put money inside has no expectation of someone not taking the money?","answer":"The reasonable conclusion (given circumstances) is that the wallet is lost, and the money inserted into it is abandoned, but a state need not recognize such a difference. &quot;Abandoned&quot; tangible property in , which you are to turn in to a law enforcement agency.

Or is the gavel purely ceremonial?","answer":"It is purely ceremonial. The tendency in modern jurisprudence is towards the practical and away from legalisms and technicalities. Even if a judge used a gavel in some way inappropriately, it would be unlikely to have any legal significance for anyone but the judge.An argument based on gavel misuse would fall into the &quot;fringe-on-the-flag&quot; category of legal arguments (yes, there are people who think that the court's powers are determined entirely by the fringe on the courhouse flag).

{"question":"Note: This question includes slight spoilers for Rogue One: A Star Wars StoryIn the recent addition to the Star Wars franchise Rogue One, there is a scene depicting Princess Leia as she appears in Episodes IV, V and VI. Rather than hiring a look-alike, the studio opted instead to digitally recreate actress Carrie Fisher's face circa 1977 when Episode IV was filmed.The actress presumably consented to this, but say she hadn't? Now that Carrie Fisher is no longer able to play the part for Episode IX, there is a good chance this technique will be used again to recreate her older face. A similar process was used in The Fast and the Furious 7 for the final scene, which hadn't yet been filmed upon the death of actor Paul Walker.Is there legal precedent over one's rights to one's digital image? If a talented animator were to create, say, a music video featuring the digital image of a dancer who wasn't present to film the video, could he or she be sued for infringing upon the natural copyright of the dancer? Would this right pass to the estate upon death, so could Carrie Fisher's estate legally consent to her digital reproduction?","answer":"Copyright to an image, digital or otherwise, is held by whoever creates it. In a movie, the question of who created the image could be complicated (is it the cameraman, the director, the producer...?), but is simplified by the fact that the item being created is a work for hire. Under copyright law, the entity that employs the various individuals has hired them to create the image, and thus the studio owns the copyright. It is always possible that there is a specific contractual arrangement where the director or someone else retains certain rights, whereby the person that the image is of might retain some special contractual rights, but that would be special. Whoever owns the copyright to the movie then has the right (within any contractual limits) to make derivative works, including recycling images into a later work. There is no copyright in\/to a person, only to an image or book about a person, and it's the creator of the image or book who holds copyright. The level of creativity required to gain copyright in a derivative work (such as embedding a picture in a film) is substantial enough that the derived image would also be protected by copyright. There is another source of limit on such a right, which is a person's publicity right. This is a property right to control how your name and image can be commercially exploited (since it is a property right, it persists past death). These rights are determined at the state level. There are, again, typically contractual clauses the spell out what control a person in a film has, and there is little chance of being able to inspect the contracts of actors in movies. There is no realistic possibility that the Star Wars movies were founded on contracts without personality rights clauses, so we can be certain that all of the agents in the films consented to being commercially exploited. There is, however, a non-negligible chance that a good lawyer could argue that a particular exploitation wasn't consented to. In some (low budget) other non-Star Wars case, it is possible that the guys in charge didn't include a good assignment of personality rights, in which case further exploitation of images would require permission (subject to the variation that one finds in state law); the estate would grant or deny such permission, in the case of a deceased actor."}

Can POTUS change the design of the US flag without an act of Congress?","answer":"\u00a71 states what the design of the flag shall be (\u00a72 mandates addition of stars when a new state is added). In essence, 4 USC 1-2 define what the flag is, and the rest of that chapter addresses what you can do with it. These are laws (passed by Congress), not rules or customs. That is, it's not a custom that the flag is 50 starts and 13 stripes, it's the law. POTUS cannot unilaterally change the law. (4 USC 3 also specifies punishments for certain kinds of flag abuse, and this too is outside the scope of that the president can do by declaration). 4 USC 5 in fact states that 'The flag of the United States for the purpose of this chapter shall be defined according to sections 1 and 2 of this title', and that  The following codification of existing rules and customs pertaining to  the display and use of the flag of the United States of America is  established for the use of such civilians or civilian groups or  organizations as may not be required to conform with regulations  promulgated by one or more executive departments of the Government of  the United States.\u00a7\u00a76-9 specify standard flag etiquette (violation of which incurs no legal punishment), and those are the rules that the president can rewrite."}

However, this law pertains to armed forces, and would not apply to remotely-launched missiles. Additionally, it is unknown if the resolution is unconstitutional (presidents say it is). No law at all requires POTUS to obtain permission from someone else, in order to engage in a military action. states that it is a punishable offense to 'willfully  disobeys  a  lawful  command  of  his  superior  commissioned  officer'. The manual also states that   An  order  requir-ing the performance of a military duty or act may be  inferred  to  be  lawful  and  it  is  disobeyed  at  the  peril   of   the  subordinate.

{"question":"This is a question about the law in USA, and is regarding civil cases.This question is only regarding cases where a civilian, or a non-governmental organization, has sued another civilian. With this question I am not interested of cases related to traffic tickets or fines given by a police department (some law blog I was reading included these in an article about civil cases).The questions I wanted to ask are:Is it possible for the defendant to end up in prison if they fail toappear in the court for this kind of matter?If failure to appear does not always lead to prison, what are thekind of situations in which it would lead to that?","answer":"Prison v. JailFirst of all, failure to appear (in the U.S.) would led to incarceration in jail (a local government facility allowing for detention typically up to one year for misdemeanors), rather than prison (which is typically a state or federal government institution incarcerating people for a year or more pursuant to a felony conviction). A jail is typically run by the county sheriff or a city's chief of police. A prison is typically run by a warden appointed by a state department of corrections.A civil court never sends anyone to prison for failure to appear, or for that matter, as a sanction for any purpose. Even a multi-year remedial civil contempt sanction is served in jail rather than prison.When Can One By Jailed For Failure To Appear In A Civil Matter?Second, failure to appear can only lead to incarceration if:(1) the person who fails to appear in either subject to a subpoena requiring that person to appear, at a date and time certain in a particular place, as a witnesses, that is personally served upon them (or where personal service is waived by the person) (this is the same in civil and criminal practice), or(2) the person is served with a judgment creditor's interrogatories to be answered in person (which are the moral equivalent of a subpoena) and must be served in the same manner, or(3) the person fails to deliver a person pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus (which is the moral equivalent of a contempt of court finding and very uncommon) that has been served in the same manner, or(4) the person has been personally served (or has personally waived such personal service) with an order to show cause (at a specific date, time and place) why they should not be held in contempt of court. The precise name of this document can vary and could also be called a 'writ' or a 'citation', rather than an 'order to show cause'. Citations for traffic offenses or other ordinance violations or civil offenses are functionally equivalent to (4).Of course, in each of the cases (1) to (4) you obviously aren't incarcerated at the moment that you fail to appear as the whole problem is that you aren't there. Instead, in each of those cases, a warrant for your arrest is issued by the court and you aren't actually incarcerated until law enforcement manages to arrest you before the warrant is vacated because you do appear, or the warrant is vacated by stipulation of the parties approved by the court, or is vacated because the matter you were required to appear for is now moot (e.g. in the case of judgment creditor's interrogatories, the judgment is paid in full).How Long Is One Incarcerated For Failure To Appear?In cases (1)-(4) the duration of incarceration is only from the time of arrest until the person can be brought before the court at the soonest possible time to do whatever they were supposed to have shown up in person to do and failed to appear at, often a matter of a few hours and rarely more than a long weekend. These forms of incarceration are for the purpose of compelling your appearance in court by force, not for punishing someone for not showing up.Other Reasons People Are Incarcerated In U.S. Civil CourtsOne can also be incarcerated in a civil court because one is found to be in contempt of court after one has appeared and been found by the court in an in person hearing to be in contempt of court, but incarceration for contempt of court itself, as opposed to failure to appear at a contempt of court hearing, is never a sanction imposed for failure to appear.Other Sanctions For Failing To AppearAlso, keep in mind that failing to appear can result in other consequences besides incarceration, the most common of which is to be found in default causing you to lose you legal case or whatever other legal matter was pending as a result of your failure to appear. Another common sanction for failure to appear (e.g. at a deposition when you are not under subpoena) is a monetary sanction to compensate others for the attorneys' fees incurred due to your non-attendance, and a determination that facts that could have been established if you had appeared will be deemed to be true regardless of reality.Civil Law Systems ComparedIn 'civil law' countries whose legal systems are not based upon the English common law, judges do not have a generalized contempt of court power and the scheme by which people are sanctioned for failing to appear in civil matters is different."}
{"question":"As part of general knowledge, there is a rule that a law still applies to you even if you do not know it.I assumed that to be fundamental, not just a rule of thumb. At least it seems natural.To my surprise, I came across an example where that is not the case:After the Access Hollywood tape was published, Donald Trump and Michael Cohen discussed with David Pecker (National Inquirer) about how to pay off Stephanie Clifford ('Stormy Daniels') to keep quiet about the sexual interactions between her and Trump.Michael Cohen confessed the interaction, and it is known in some detail.But it seems to be a question whether Trump did something illegal here exactly because it is not clear whether he knew it was illegal.*How does that fundamentally make sense?In which laws does that apply?*","answer":"There is a difference between knowing the law and knowing the facts. Usually, ignorance of the law is no excuse. But for criminal offenses, ignorance of the facts is an excuse. Another way of putting it is, to be guilty, the suspect must have intended to perform the action that's illegal. Suppose I intend to hunt deer in Vermont. Without realizing it, I cross the border into NY, and I don't have a NY hunting license. I haven't committed a criminal offense because I didn't intend to hunt deer in NY. But NY might have created a civil penalty of taking a deer without a license, no intent required, so I might have to pay the civil penalty."}
{"question":"An occasional trope in media, or in real life, is to have someone who is obviously intoxicated handed another drink and, when someone calls the server on it, they say that they gave them water instead of vodka, or a Jack and Coke without the Jack, with the implication being that they're doing the right thing by not giving the person more alcohol, but also avoiding conflict by fooling the person into thinking they're getting alcohol when they're not. Leaving aside that , it also occurred to me that, in a business situation, it could be argued that the bartender is instituting a sort of fraud on the customer by doing an extreme version of \"watering the drinks\". I assume that there'd be some degree of leniency if the bartender argues that they were trying to avoid harm by doing a reduced version of refusing service, and that a further method of avoiding trouble would be not charging at all for the substitute drinks (not even charging them for the soda you substituted, for example), but I could see a case still being made for a customer, or someone with them noticing the switch, claiming they are being defrauded.So, is it legal for a bartender to switch someone to non-alcoholic drinks without telling them in the United States?","answer":"Bartenders and their employers face stiff regulatory penalties (including fines and loss of a license to serve alcohol), and they also face potentially massive lawsuit liability for serving alcohol to someone is who too drunk if the patron later leaves and drives drunk or other harm results (such lawsuits are sometimes called &quot;dramshop actions&quot;).If a bartender serves a &quot;virgin&quot; drink when a regular one is ordered, without the customer's knowledge, this could result in liability for breach of contract (with the damages likely being either a nominal $1 or the difference between the cost of the regular drink and the virgin drink if the customer is charged the higher price). But affirmative defenses of illegality of the proposed contract (when the customers orders an alcoholic drink) might void liability.It could also result in liability for fraudulent misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment. But again, unless the customer is up-charged for the alcoholic price while getting a less expensive drink, the damages would be nominal (unlikely to exceed $1) and affirmative defenses might apply."}
{"question":"According to the official  as of March 8, 2021 (emphasis in original),Travelers and residents returning from any U.S. state or territory beyond the immediate region (New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Delaware) should self-quarantine at their home, hotel, or other temporary lodging following recommendations from the CDC:...The self-quarantine is voluntary, but compliance is expected.The site comes out and seems to say that the quarantine is voluntary, but then says that \"compliance is expected\".Is there a legal penalty or intervention for not following the above guidelines, or are these rules enforced solely through social pressure (frowns, social ostracism, gossip, etc.)?To be clear, I'm not asking for the socially responsible or healthy choice, but the legal one. For example, if someone were to walk into a NJ government office and loudly proclaim that they had just arrived from Texas and won't be self-quarantining, is there anything they can do except appeal to the person's conscience? In other words, is the description of the quarantine as \"voluntary\" more a recognition that public health authorities are not actively monitoring and pursuing visitors as a matter of practice or is it a recognition that the state literally has no legal means to force visitors to comply?Also to be clear, I'm asking solely about the general quarantine described above. Cases where someone has tested positive for COVID-19 or been specifically identified as a close contact of someone who did are out of scope for this question.Why someone would want to travel to New Jersey is out of scope for this question.","answer":"Direct answer: there MIGHT be consequences. For detailed informations, you should call the NJ COVID-19 Info Hub: General COVID-19 Questions: 2-1-1 (24\/7)Let me start by saying, I'm not a lawyer and this is my interpretation based on the information I could find on State and Federal websites. I strongly suggest to call the number mentioned above to get an official answer to your questions.What do I mean?Self-quarantining is a rule you're expected to follow; to the best of my knowledge it's not a crime to not self-quarantine and you won't be arrested because of it, but there could be legal implications if your refusal to do so is linked to the spread of the virus or other consequences (public endangerment).The New Jersey Department of Health released a FAQ in which they respond to &quot;How will self-quarantine be enforced?&quot; which states:The quarantine is voluntary, but compliance is expected. Travelers and residents returning from another state or territory outside of the immediate region typically will not need to check-in with public health officials, unless otherwise they are involved in contact tracing efforts or required to do so by their employer or any other federal, state or local law or order. It is expected that individuals will follow the recommendation to quarantine.In other words, while there's no check-in imposed on all travelers, you could get involved in contact tracing or similar activities by law enforcement. In that case, you might face consequences if you didn't self-quarantine.From the New Jersey COVID-19 Information Hub:New Jersey strongly discourages all non-essential interstate travel at this time. At this time, individuals who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 should continue to follow the State's travel advisory.Travelers and residents returning from any U.S. state or territory beyond the immediate region (New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Delaware) should self-quarantine at their home, hotel, or other temporary lodging following recommendations from the CDC.The self-quarantine is voluntary, but compliance is expected. Travelers arriving from areas with increasing COVID-19 cases may wish to postpone their travel to the region if they are unwilling or unable to follow the quarantine advisory.As you can see, even vaccinated individuals and people from nearby states are asked to avoid non-essential travel or self-quarantine if they can't avoid it.Travelers are also asked to fill the following &quot;OUT OF STATE TRAVEL REGISTRATION&quot; form. This is a voluntary survey, useful in case of contact tracing and other covid-related emergency procedures.I'll leave you with the updated CDC Travel During COVID-19 guidelines: "}

Call me skeptical, but the don't look authoritative to me.   However, let's consider what Google Translate says:delegatus non potest delegate: A delegate cannot delegatedelegata potestas non potest delegari: Delegated power cannot be delegatedWikipedia seems to assume both Latin phrases contain the word \"power\" twice.   I don't know Latin that well, but I think \"potest\" has a different meaning than \"potestas\".","answer":"The translation issues are addressed well enough in the OP and the comments.The Latin phrases <i>delegatus non potest delegare<\/i> and <i>delegata potestas non potest delegari<\/i> do not have consistently distinct meanings in modern legal usage.

The heartland of cases where <i>delegatus non potest delegare<\/i> and <i>delegata potestas non potest delegari<\/i> and the English language equivalents of this doctrine historically applied at common law are now governed by a mismash of context specific state statutes which resolve the quoted question differently.Usually, for example, there are different statutes governing different kinds of court appointed fiduciaries, private entity managers and officers and directors (sometimes with different rules for different types of entities such as a distinction between corporate and LLC officials and general partners in general partnerships in Colorado law), and government officials in different particular types of governmental entities and positions.The rule isn't even necessarily consistent, for example, between different elected executive branch officials within a single county government. One rule may apply to the county surveyor or coroner, and another to the county treasurer or sheriff.Even the interpretation of less specific language found in statutes isn't necessarily interpreted terribly consistently from statute to statute within a state, or between states. Largely, the case law hinges upon what context and common sense seems to call for under the  circumstances of particular cases.Also, the common law case law on this question in areas where statutes have not superseded the common law, isn't terribly consistent from state to state, and so far as I know there isn't really any strong regional or historical trend at work. It has been more of a matter of random drift. It is a fine grained enough issue that there isn't a near universal common law rule."}
{"question":"Recently, a company in Denmark called 'Njord Law Firm' sent out about 25,000 penalty letters to Swedish citizens regarding downloading pirate movies from Piratebay, Popcorn time, or as such. They got this information from ISPs with a permission from the court. They are asking for about 4,500 Swedish Krona (~514 USD) as a fine for downloading a copyrighted movie material (on behalf of a bunch of film makers\/producers). They also mentioned that if subsciber don't pay this amount, they will increase the fine and\/or they will file a lawsuit against them! The surprising thing is that they are a 100% legal company and the letter seems legit! I can confirm this is not a scam, as we contacted police and our ISP.Considering almost all internet subscribers today have wifi routers and open internet access, its too vague who had really download such copyrighted materials. If they really file a lawsuit against the subscribers (in case of no payment), can subscibers claim they had a wifi router and they provided the username\/password to so many people and its not clear who is the 'guilty person' ?","answer":"Literal Answer: Anyone can file a lawsuit for anything, doesn't mean you will win or that the judge will let it go as far as trial, but you can certainly file a lawsuit.Deeper answer: Yes they can file a lawsuit assuming they have been given authority to represent the copyright holders.The problem with succeeding in such a lawsuit is proving who is liable. This is contractual, but as the ISP customer it's possible that you signed that you would be responsible for the traffic going to your ISP. If this is not the case, it can be hard to prove who is responsible. There is also the issue of did the movie actually download? Just because you clicked a link to download, does not mean a download happened and that could be hard to for the other side to prove.Then there is the question of what is the intent of the letters? Do they want people to be aware that they will be caught and stop pirating or do they really want 4,500 X 25,000 Swedish Krona? Whether they sue the non-payers or not likely comes down to how many people send in the money but in any case it is in their best interest to make the public at large believe that they will be sued."}
{"question":"I just found (:18 U.S. Code 1725 - Postage unpaid on deposited mail matterWhoever knowingly and willfully deposits any mailable matter such as statements of accounts, circulars, sale bills, or other like matter, on which no postage has been paid, in any letter box established, approved, or accepted by the Postal Service for the receipt or delivery of mail matter on any mail route with intent to avoid payment of lawful postage thereon, shall for each such offense be fined under this title.So, say I want to write a physical letter to my neighbor next door. I don't want to hand it in person or put it under their door. I just want to deliver it to their mailbox.Does the above law require me to pay postage on it? Or, can it be argued that I have no \"intent to avoid payment of lawful postage thereon\" as there is no reasonable necessity to use postal service in the first place?Then, as a marketing agency who finds it more economical to hire delivery persons rather than use postal service, would there be any \"intent to avoid payment of lawful postage\"? As with the neighbors example, it is simply neither reasonable nor necessary for the agency to use postal service in the first place, so what \"intent to avoid\" can even be talked about? Even if it was more economical to use postal service, is the agency not within its rights to not give a damn about even the existence of postal service and hire its own delivery personnel just because it fancies so?How do private courier services operate in the US? Do they obtain permission from the Postal Service to use people's mailboxes? (assuming the parcels are small enough to fit in them)Finally, as someone who wishes to receive letters like that, what can I do to allow the senders do it without breaking the law? Install a separate mailbox which is not \"approved, or accepted by the Postal Service\" and clearly marked like \"non-postal delivery only\"?","answer":"First,  provides an escape hatch for private delivery of mail to official postboxes, thatThis section shall not prohibit any person from receiving anddelivering to the nearest post office, postal car, or other authorizeddepository for mail matter any mail matter properly stamped.In other words, it's not the act of putting the thing in the mailbox, it is the avoidance of the revenue owed to the USPS. This revenue-based principle behind the law is completely uncontroversial.Also see  for non-criminal regulations governing private mail delivery which specifies a punitive rate for private carriage of letters:the amount paid for the private carriage of the letter is at least theamount equal to 6 times the rate then currently charged for the 1stounce of a single-piece first class letterThis law is important in evaluating claims as to what would be reasonable or unreasonable as far as payment of postage is concerned.In , 453 U.S. 114, SCOTUS upheld the law as not infringing on First Amendment rights. The USPS states (taken from the opinion) thatThe appellees can deliver their messages either by paying postage, byhanging their notices on doorknobs, by placing their notices underdoors or under a doormat, by using newspaper or nonpostal boxesaffixed to houses or mailbox posts, by telephoning their constituents,by engaging in person-to-person delivery in public areas, by tackingor taping their notices on a door post or letterbox post, or byplacing advertisements in local newspapers.Unambiguously, it is legal to place sufficiently-stamped material in the mailbox.The issue of &quot;intent&quot; (w.r.t. unstamped mail) was very lightly touched on by defendant, who called on 1696(c), that(c) This chapter shall not prohibit the conveyance or transmission ofletters or packets by private hands without compensation, or byspecial messenger employed for the particular occasion only.(relevant to the case because defendants were a volunteer organization). They And our argument is that if there is no need to require the payment ofpostage for a noncompensated individual, how can he possibly under1725 have the intent to avoid the payment of postage if no postage isrequired?The court did not even acknowledge this argument in the opinion (defendant incorrectly maintained that the requirement for paying postage only applies to commercial mail, a claim which the court explicitly rejected). The theory was that if there is no requirement to pay postage on volunteer-delivered non-commercial flyers, there can be no intent to avoid payment. This argument fails, though, since there is a requirement to pay postage, i.e. non-commercial mail is not delivered for free.Regarding the argument that &quot;there is no reasonable necessity to use postal service in the first place&quot;, this is true as acknowledged by all parties: you can hand-deliver to the recipient, you can nail it to the door, you can leave it on the porch, and so on. The one thing you can't do is put it in the US mailbox (unless you have paid postage). The alternatives are completely reasonable: therefore, failure to pay either signals ignorance of the law (which is no excuse), or an intent to avoid the requirement payment to USPS. A company may find it more economical to hire delivery persons rather than use the postal service, but again the motivation for non-payment of postage is that the company does not want to pay the required fee, so the intent can only be reasonably construed to be literally &quot;avoid payment of lawful postage&quot;.There appears to be no legal precedent where a person argued a lack of intent under this law because they found the need to pay postage when USPS does nothing to be silly (unreasonable)."}
{"question":"NY state here.If I go to get a second opinion from a physician other than my primary, are there any regulations (HIPAA or otherwise) that require that 2nd physician to share consultation notes\/lab results with my primary?","answer":":  Does the HIPAA Privacy Rule permit doctors, nurses, and other health care providers to share patient health information for treatment purposes without the patient's authorization?with:  Yes. The Privacy Rule allows those doctors, nurses, hospitals, laboratory technicians, and other health care providers that are covered entities to use or disclose protected health information, such as X-rays, laboratory and pathology reports, diagnoses, and other medical information for treatment purposes without the patient's authorization. This includes sharing the information to consult with other providers, including providers who are not covered entities, to treat a different patient, or to refer the patient. See .This implies that if Doctor 1 requests your records from Doctor 2 for treatment purposes, Doctor 2 may provide them.   Reciprocal practices in the medical field may make such requests required in practice, if anyone at Doctor 2's practice might in the future want to request records\/cooperation from any practice in Doctor 1's network.  This rule also implies that if Doctor 2 believes that sharing the information with Doctor 1 will be helpful for treatment purposes, Doctor 2 can do that without a request from Doctor 1, and depending on the situation may be ethically required to do so if Doctor 2 believes it's critical for Doctor 1 to get this information. If you are requesting that Doctor 2 share the information with Doctor 1, and Doctor 2 is refusing, you can get a copy of your record and give it to Doctor 1.  User Nate Eldredge has  permits you to skip a step and direct Doctor 2 to transmit the health records directly to Doctor 1 instead of going through you directly, but from a legal perspective it's basically the same.  Doctor 2 can charge a fee for this.Absent any obvious reason why Doctor 2 would feel ethically obliged to inform Doctor 1 about without treating\/taking care of that reason directly, and absent any request for the information to be shared (the question as stated at time of answering does not indicate that any request has been made by anybody for the information to be shared), there is no law requiring Doctor 2 to send the report to anybody.  This answer assumes that Doctor 1 and Doctor 2 work for different healthcare systems, such that Doctor's 2 entry of your record which may automatically go to his\/her employer (by contract law) does not therefore also reach the same system Doctor 1 accesses when looking up your record, automatically.

{"question":"If a kid gets left in a hot car (e.g. because the caretaker )... (according to what distinguishing fact can be found in the article) as potential determiners of whether or not charges are brought against a caretaker. That is not a very satisfying set of factors.  So, I ask:What are the factors used to determine whether or not the caretaker is charged in such a situation? For this question, assume: the period was hours, the kid died, the caretaker admitted to what s\/he did, andthe caretaker claimed it's because s\/he forgot.  If the whole United States is too broad, answer for whichever state(s) you can give the best answer for, or New York if you need a more specific pointer. ","answer":"There are many factors that determine whether charges are brought (not just for negligent homicide). One pertains to jurisdiction: if there is a difference in the statutes of two states, you will get different likelihoods of prosecution. The second pertains to prevailing case law, that is, how the courts interpret the words of a statute. The third is the facts surrounding the particular case, such as whether the accused is a very good person who made a mistake while at church, versus a very bad person who made a mistake while drunk. The fourth is the jury pool. All of these pertain to the probability of getting a conviction (if there isn't a reasonable chance of getting a conviction, a prosecutor is unlikely to press charges). And finally there can be personality matters pertaining to the prosecutor. Although the law pretends that prosecutors are automatic emotionless machines that inerrantly and resolutely follow the law, some prosecutors are more aggressive and some are kinder and gentler.Kids in hot cars is a specialized niche in case law, so I don't think one can learn much about the nature of prosecutorial discretion from focusing just on those cases (Lexis gives me over 1000 cases involving 'negligent homicide' and only 185 of them are about children; 85 of those are about cars; 6 are about anything hot). The thing is that case law doesn't tell you anything about cases that a prosecutor did not pursue, so there is really no objective basis for guessing, unless someone does a large-scale survey of prosecutors. (The reason is that case law is the outcome of matters actually pursued in the courts, so when a prosecutor decides not to prosecute, there is no case law)."}

'How do I approach this problem in this context' is the right question.By default a person has no obligation to cooperate with a generic investigator--why would they?  There are ways around that in specific contexts and for specific professionals (failure to follow lawful order of a police officer, criminal charges for lying to a federal agent, cross-examination, discovery requests, etc...)

I am thinking that is wrong.You are correct.This said, in a very small dollar estate (e.g. $20,000, with the actual dollar amount varying state by state), some states allow you to transfer assets by affidavit rather than via the probate process, if the sold heir at all and will beneficiary are the same and there are no unpaid creditors with a claim against those funds.New Jersey has  for estates under $50,000. The cutoff is sometimes $10,000, sometimes $20,000, and sometimes $50,000 depending upon the circumstances and the nature of the simplified process sought. It isn't clear to me that they apply in cases where the decedent has a will and therefore is not intestate.Small Estates General Summary: Small Estate laws were enacted in orderto enable heirs to obtain property of the deceased without probate, orwith shortened probate proceedings, provided certain conditions aremet. Small estates can be administered with less time and cost. If thedeceased had conveyed most property to a trust but there remains someproperty, small estate laws may also be available. Small Estateprocedures may generally be used regardless of whether there was aWill. In general, the two forms of small estate procedures arerecognized:Small Estate Affidavit -Some States allow an affidavit to be executed by the spouse and\/or heirs of the deceased and present theaffidavit to the holder of property such as a bank to obtain propertyof the deceased. Other states require that the affidavit be filed withthe Court. The main requirement before you may use an affidavit isthat the value of the personal and\/or real property of the estate notexceed a certain value.Summary Administration -Some states allow a Summary administration. Some States recognize both the Small Estate affidavit and SummaryAdministration, basing the requirement of which one to use on thevalue of the estate. Example: If the estate value is 10,000 or less anaffidavit is allowed but if the value is between 10,000 to 20,000 asummary administration is allowed.New Jersey Summary: Under New Jersey statute, where as estate isvalued at less than $50,000, a surviving spouse,  partner in a civilunion, or domestic partner, may present an affidavit of a small estatebefore the Superior Court.

{"question":"I am planning to sell a physical sculpture based on Michelangelo's Creation of Adam. There would be some additional features besides just the sculpture, but those are irrelevant for the purposes of this question. The painting, for those unfamiliar:The sculpture would be 3d modeled and then 3d printed. To give a sense of what I'm talking about, Unless I can license that particular model, my plan is to pay another artist to create a similar model that I would then have ownership of. But, here comes the problem:According to , \"The Holy See owns all copyrights in the works published under its name or created on its commission (art. 5).\" Since this painting was commissioned by the Vatican for the Sistine Chapel, they own the copyright to it. So, I have several questions:In general, if a painting is copyrighted, can a sculpture be created based on that painting without violating the painting's copyright?If not, would the religious nature of the scene be a good legal defense? I.e. this sculpture was inspired by the story of God creating man (not copyrighted), rather than inspired by a specific painting of God creating man (copyrighted).If I do somehow violate copyright, how likely is it that the Vatican would actually sue? How far does their jurisdiction extend?If I commission another artist to create a sculpture based on the painting, could I be violating the copyright of the artist who has ?If it matters, I am based in the US, though I would ideally like to be able to sell outside of the US.

Thank you!","answer":"&quot;The Holy See owns all copyrights in the works published under its name or created on its commission (art. 5).&quot; Since this painting was commissioned by the Vatican for the Sistine Chapel, they own the copyright to it.The first sentence just says the Vatican owns all copyrights that exist, it doesn't speak to whether any copyrights exist in the first place. Earlier in that article, it says &quot;The law provides for copyright 70 years after the death of the author, or 70 years after publication for works with no named author.&quot; I don't know off-hand when Michelangelo died, but I'm pretty sure that it was more than 70 years ago. So if there is a copyright, it has long since expired, and who owns it is a moot point. The painting is well in the public domain.If there were a valid copyright, a sculpture would be a derivative work and would require a license."}

{"question":"Are US employers allowed to unilaterally cut the pay for an employee, specific team or all employees through a one-off measure? Are forced contributions to charity, pay reductions during an economic crisis, fines for not meeting performance goals, and others legally above board?From my limited understanding of US labor law, an employer is free to reduce pay going forward for any reason that isn't covered by specific anti-discrimination laws.

See, for instance, .The case of the CEO's book sounds in clear violation of MCL 408.477(2) since the user who asked on Workplace SE mentions that the employees did not consent to that deduction.Even if an employee consents to the deduction, it is important to discern between (1) his altruistic consent, and (2) his concession for the sake of continuation of employment. Unless the consent is altruistic, the clause(s) allowing for the deduction might be rendered null and enforceable by virtue of  at 178(1) in relation to the aforementioned statutes.Any form of deductions as a permissible sanction (as fining when the employee gets late to work) would have to be provided in the agreement between employer and employee.

If it had been a motorcycle, or some weirdly thin car which had attempted to do this, I think the driver would have been prudent to position their own vehicle in a way to prevent future conflict (Two cars in same lane going in same direction). Even if there is some law in some jurisdictions which allows for this (IMO dangerous) behavior, I still don't think the car did anything wrong, it's akin to changing lanes from left to right to prevent a school bus from potentially getting around you to the stop first. Nothing illegal in a lane change, even if it is jerkish to the SB. But since I've already been surprised by one bike related law which makes no sense to me, I thought I'd post this question. Does anyone know of any laws or precedents which makes the described behavior illegal? One last note: This question is here instead of Bikes.SE because I'm concerned with the law, and I believe I can reasonably predict that a Bikes.SE response will likely try to claim that bikes have the right to overtake cars on the right at all times (since this claim was made in a question about overtaking a car turning right on the right).

The driver passing the bike on the left probably . There is no law requiring a car driver to leave extra room in case a bike is coming up on him, so it is legal to pull close to the curb.

The law isn't clear on whether 'two vehicles' means 'any two vehicles', or 'the two vehicles right here and now' -- passing within an 11 ft. wide lane is not save for two cars, and completely unproblematic for two bicycles."}
{"question":"last month I ordered a computer from an American company that shipped it through FedEx.

Does Alvin's conduct satisfy the elements of the crime?  Alvin engaged in sexual intercourse with another person (namely Betty)at a time when the other person (Betty again) had a living spouse (namely Charlie). So yes, Alvin has violated this law.Betty has also violated the law (the first clause instead of the second).Betty engaged in sexual intercourse with another person (Alvin)at a time when he (Betty; the pronoun 'he' is meant to be gender-neutral in the statute's style of writing)had a living spouse (Charlie).However, this law is effectively unenforced in modern times.  According to :  It is extremely rare for anyone to be arrested just for adultery.  Indeed, since 1972, only 13 persons have been charged with adultery. Of those 13 persons, only five actually were convicted of the crime.  In virtually every one of those cases, there was some other crime that was committed and the prosecuting attorney added adultery as just one of many crimes committed.If Charlie files a complaint regarding the affair, it is almost certain that the police and prosecutors will ignore it, and that nobody will actually be charged with anything.

A president cannot tell states or cities what to do, but a federal mandate will affect federal offices and federal lands and will urge states to do the same.but in reading the executive order, there appears to be no sunset, and no limitation and if it isn't rescinded the expectation is that we'll always be expected to wear masks on federal lands and in federal buildings.So, from a legal standpoint, does this executive order necessarily need to be rescinded, does it go away when the CDC no longer recommends masking or does it remain perpetually?","answer":"Section 2 (a) of the  says:The heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to require compliance with CDC guidelines with respect to wearing masks, maintaining physical distance, and other public health measures by:  on-duty or on-site Federal employees; on-site Federal contractors; and all persons in Federal buildings or on Federal lands. (emphasis added)It would seem that if, in future, the CDC changes its guidelines to indicate that mask wearing is no longer needed (presumably in the wake of a large decline in cases) the order would mean compliance with such revised guidelines, and thus reduced or eliminated mask wearing, when and if that is advised.The order does not contain any dated sunset or reevaluation provision.

{"question":"An episode of Black Mirror Season 3 Episode 3, Shut Up and Dance, presents what seems like an interesting legal scenario, at least to me (NAL). A kid's computer gets a virus. Let's say he's 16. Someone records him masturbating to child porn via his webcam secretly, then blackmails him into going to a location. At the location he's given a cake, and told to bring it to another location, where another blackmailed accomplice joins him and they're told to go to another location where they find a bank. I'm explaining this in order in case the vagueness of each instruction and timing is pertinent legally to the charges. As a side question, I'd be interested to know if these details, such as the way he originally didn't plan to rob a bank or kill someone, but each thing developed in a vicious cycle, would affect the charges.They're then told to look inside the cake where they find a gun. The boy is told to rob the bank at gunpoint, he does it, and then leaves with the cash in the drawer. Then they get to a drop point, the kid's told to bring the money out into a secluded patch of woods, where he finds another blackmailed man, and they're both instructed to fight to the death. The boy tries to shoot himself, but the gun isnt loaded, kills the man (after trying to run, so this actually appears to be in self defense), walks away and is soon chased down by cops after his location is reported by the blackmailers (who didnt care about the money) with the money on his person, and his masturbation video to child porn is released to the public also.With the blackmail and not being an adult, it seems like an interesting legal scenario. What charges might this kid face?

This defect can be cured if the prosecution obtains a search warrant for the suspect's computer as possession alone meets the statutory threshold.<h3>Aggravated Robbery<\/h3>In Ohio, aggravated robbery is not a strict liability (i.e., statutory) crime. Therefore, mens rea (mental state) of the offender can be a legal defense.

{"question":"A court tells the prosecutor and the police not to tell the jury that the defendant has a prior arrest. Then the prosecutor asks the witness 'Officer, how did you find out where the defendant lived, so that you could go there and arrest him?'.  The officer has of course been ordered to answer the questions and tell the truth, and so replies: 'I found out from the record of a prior arrest.'  So there's prosecutorial misconduct.  But is it misconduct on the part of the witness?  Should the witness have declined to answer?  And if so what would the witness say as a reason for refusing to answer?","answer":"The underlying facts will bear more on who is at fault for this breach of the judge's order.  For instance, if the cop had told the prosecutor that he had gotten the address from an informant, but then changed his testimony on the stand, then it really isn't prosecutorial misconduct.  If the prosecutor knew what answer was forthcoming, then it may be some form of misconduct and how serious depends on a number of factors like intent and history of the prosecutor.  But the more important question is what remedy are you seeking?  The most likely outcome no matter what is behind the question and answer is for the judge to instruct the jury to disregard the answer and to not use the information in weighing the evidence.  If this is more prejudicial to the defendant or is part of a larger pattern of problems, then the judge may issue a special jury instruction or declare a mistrial.  None of these remedies rest on who was at fault, but rather on the amount of prejudice.  If, on the other hand, you want to file a bar complaint against the prosecutor, it will all come down to who said what to whom and when.  If you want the judge to hold the cop in contempt (the cop can't be disbarred, unless the cop also happens to be an attorney), then the same factual inquiry would like be necessary but it would be unlikely for a judge to consider digging into the matter at all and it is entirely within her discretion as judge.I believe the direct answer to your question is 'it could be one, neither, or both, but it probably doesn't matter.'Part of the question asks 'Should the witness have declined to answer'?  If the witness was aware of the court's ruling on the motion to exclude, then the witness should not have answered and could have asked for a clarification from the judge (outside the presence of the jury) whether the witness can answer the question. The witness could have turned to the judge and said 'Your honor, I am not sure how to answer that question within in the confines of your previous rulings.'  The judge would like excuse the jury and the lawyers and judges can confer."}

That said, the [for ProductName?] will be written in a small box that is roughly in the color of that product (i.e. a blue for Outlook; but not the exact same color code).I had a read through Microsoft's brand\/trademark use guidelines: You may not: use the trademarks in the name of your business, product, service, app, domain name, social media account, or other offeringThis is pretty clear.But the '' state:Your registered publisher name and everything about your appname, logo, description, screenshotsmust be unique and free of Microsoft trademarks unless (1) you've secured permission from Microsoft through a license or equivalent (though such licenses are not generally available in this context); or (2) you're only using a Microsoft trademark (not including logos) to describe that your product is designed to work in conjunction with a Microsoft product or service and as long as your app logo and\/or name (1) does not suggest\/give the impression your app is actually published by, affiliated with or endorsed by Microsoft; and (2) denotes your own unique brand so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation or endorsement by Microsoft.Now things are less clear.My only reason for the use of 'Outlook' or 'Project' as a small component of the  logo's subtitle and product name is to signal to users its compatibility with said Office products.Of course, YANAL, but perhaps someone has some additional insights to share.  I know that many businesses use this type of naming convention in marketing their products as being part of and extending the Office eco-system.I might add that these Add-Ins are intended to be commercial and that none of Microsoft's trademarks are used in domain names - just as a small addition below the logo as outlined above.The website, 'About Dialog' and so forth, will all state that:Microsoft, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Project and the Office logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and\/or other countries. All other trademarks are property of their respective owners. Microsoft is not affiliated with [MyBrandName] and does not endorse this product.With the exact trademarks listed as here: Question: is this use of Microsoft trademarks allowable?I appreciate that, unless an authoritative source can be found that pertains to Office Add-Ins specifically, it may be hard\/impossible to definitively answer questions around the legality of this.If that is the case, perhaps someone can share some guidance around acceptable use and likelihood of Microsoft not taking kindly to a situation like this.With Office Add-Ins, the situation is such that they benefit the Office platform as a whole - after all,  Microsoft has invested significant resources in opening-up its platform via the VSTO\/Add-In API.Personally, I imagine no issues as long as such Add-Ins\/products make it clear that they are not affiliated with or endorsed by Microsoft, and as long as such Add-Ins have their own brand identity that is clearly distinguished from that of Microsoft\/Office (although they refer to specific Microsoft products as a means of signalling compatibility; like many Add-In developers already do).Add to that the fact that Microsoft's 'App Guidelines' make this exact same point - just that these guidelines refer to 'Apps' (probably Windows Universal Platform Apps) and not Office Add-Ins.Sub-question: can you imagine a worse scenario than Microsoft sending a Cease and Desist notice?  In that case, I can imagine re-branding to 'MYBRAND for E-Mail' as the logo\/name and a textual reference to 'The [MyBrand for E-Mail] Add-In for Microsoft?

In that case, I can imagine re-branding to 'MYBRAND for  E-Mail' as the logo\/name and a textual reference to 'The [MyBrand for  E-Mail] Add-In for Microsoft?

{"question":"If an American citizen murders another American citizen abroad in a country which an extradition treaty exists, but is first arrested back in the United States where they have since returned to - where does the prosecution occur?Specifically I ask the question because this happens in the fictional HBO show Search Party.

I'm wondering if this is what would actually happen in real life. seems to cover this topic but from my limited understanding it seems to imply that since the U.S. and Canada have a treaty the defendant(s) would be extradited to Canada for trial.Aside from this it also states:\"...the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determines that the conduct took place in a country in which the person is no longer present\"and I'm wondering what that process actually looks like.

The area where a crime or other wrongdoing is committed is considered the proper &quot;forum&quot; for adjudicating the case.With respect to the law you cited, you should take note of the statutory limitations imposed upon the Attorney General in pursuing such a case (called a 1119 prosecution).  When considering the limitations, it is unlikely a trial of an American who killed an American in Canada would be tried in the United States.Those  begin with a prosecutor seeking written permission by the AG.  This permission cannot be granted if the other country has already prosecuted the individual for the same conduct. Also, the AG can only give that permission if, after consulting the Secretary of State, he or she determines that the killing occurred in a jurisdiction where the suspect is &quot;no longer present&quot; and that the country is unable to &quot;lawfully secure the person's return.&quot;and I'm wondering what that process actually looks like.This would be a consultation between Justice Department attorneys and the Assistant Secretary(ies) of State whose portfolio contains the foreign country in question. From the DOJ in particular, the Assistant AG for the Criminal Division is in charge of considering the above criteria and granting approvals.  The Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section handles these issues within the Criminal Division.Does the Attorney General have to petition the other government for permission to prosecute them in the home country?No. The statutory limitations listed above necessitate that the suspect has already left that country and part of the AG's determination must be that it is unlikely that country will be able to secure the person's return.  That said, might that country petition the United States that it wants the suspect to be returned to stand trial there? Potentially.Does it make a difference if the key witnesses are also all Americans, therefore arguing that chances of conviction are more likely if tried within the U.S. where all participants reside and are available to testify?This is, of course, a general consideration when determining which jurisdiction should handle a matter.  It isn't clear to what degree it comes into consideration in this type of prosecution.does anyone know any famous\/well known examples of this happening?Famous\/well-known?  I can't be sure, but see, e.g., United States v , 123 F.Supp.3d 1246 (S.D.

Clearly stating under which conditions you (the accuser) would earn money by doing nothing more than staying online for 7 days? You agreed to these conditions, but did not fulfill them, so the scammer (the accused) was the one that earned money for doing nothing. The scammer had the same motive as you had, earning money for doing nothing. In the end a Judge will  make a decision based on the presented situation and motive of the participants. In this case the motives were the same, but you did not fulfill the conditions you agreed to, so the other - as agreed to - earned the money for doing nothing. The Judge will probably come to the conclusion that had you, in the unlikely event of actually earning money for doing nothing, would not make a claim that the scammer was trying to commit a fraud.So the Judge's final conclusion may be, that both parties had agreed to attempt fraud against each other and that only one would be successful.Since the agreed result (as desired by both parties, whom we assume are not minors) came about, the Judge would probably dismiss this case to avoid further waste of the taxpayers money.Based on the Jurisdiction, this will be worded differently - but in the final result will mean the same.

really, what I'm going toward, is the following question. Say I have a library of common contracts at my office. In there I have a general independent contract agreement which I've archived\/categorized in my office library as Independent Contractor Agreement #123, without any fill-in-the-blanks. Now, when I hire an independent contractor, all I give them is a document that looks pretty much like this (ignore the actual language, I am new to legal documents).I ___Foo___ will engage in project __Bar__ with company __Baz__ on date __Date__ according to contract Independent Contractor Agreement #123 in the library of __Baz__ which I have read and understand and agree to.__Foo__That is, you don't even have to give them a copy of the contract. In the same way you might reference some legal code without actually copying the legal code directly into the contract. Instead you would do along the lines of this writing:According to 31 U.S. Code 5330, we will ...Rather thanAccording to 31 U.S. Code 5330, which says:Registration With Secretary of the Treasury Required.    In general.Any person who owns or controls a money transmitting business shall register the business (whether or not the business is licensed as a money transmitting business in any State) with the Secretary of the Treasury not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the later ofthe date of enactment of the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994; orthe date on which the business is established.[100's more lines...]we will ...I'm wondering if you can do this same sort of thing. Only have the contract be a few lines, with the bulk of it stored in some external library somewhere for reference. Or if there is some law\/thing that states that you are required to include all the prose of the contract in the document the person who signs it takes home. If nothing else, this would save on a lot of paper and ink.One reason I can think of why this might not be acceptable is because perhaps the person maintaining the contract at their own library could change it after the fact. So that's probably why you'd want to always give them a copy (snapshot) of the prose as it stood at time of signing. But then again, maybe not, you could change the copy after the fact with regular contracts too in the same way, so perhaps it would still be possible then. Hmm...","answer":"  That is, you don't even have to give them a copy of the contract. In the same way you might reference some legal code without actually copying the legal code directly into the contract.If you do not communicate material terms of the contract to your contractor, the contract will be unenforceable due to lack of .Referencing 'some legal code', provided that that code is publicly available is fine: your contractor can look it up and decide if they are happy with it.But doing the same with 'Independent Contractor Agreement #123' will only work if you provide a copy of it to your contractor. For example, it can be attached to the paper being signed as a Schedule.So, in a nut shell, abstracting prose out is fine as long as it is communicated\/attached."}
{"question":"In most cases if a state declares a substance or procedure to be illegal it doesn't prohibit one from going to another state where said substance (marijuana) or procedure (abortion) is legal.But this isn't the case with firearms. How can a state (NY for example) prohibit a resident of that state from purchasing a firearm in another state?I understand, and respect the fact, that a state can prevent the resident from bringing the newly purchased firearm into the state.I understand that the state can prevent non-residents from bringing a firearm with them even though it's legal in the other state. But on what grounds can a state prevent a purchase in another state. One can have a second home there; one can have family; one may be able to store the firearms there.Is this situation unique to firearms or do such prohibitions exist in other arenas as well?","answer":"Because the prohibition of selling to a resident of another state isn't a state law, but rather a Federal law.   May a licensee sell a firearm to a nonlicensee who is a resident of another State?    Generally, a firearm may not lawfully be sold by a licensee to a nonlicensee who resides in a State other than the State in which the seller's licensed premises is located... In addition, a licensee may sell a rifle or shotgun to a person who is not a resident of the State where the licensee's business premises is located in an over\u2013the\u2013counter transaction, provided the transaction complies with State law in the State where the licensee is located and in the State where the purchaser resides.

{"question":" tells us that embassy soil is inviolable, as per Vienna Convention on diplomatic Relations 1961, art. 22. That means the host country ('s law enforcement) cannot enter the premises nor do anything inside.I assume that applies only without the consent of the head of the diplomatic mission, but is that right? My understanding of the arrest of Julian Assange in UK by bobbies given access by the Ecuador diplomats seems to go that way.What about the mission country's law enforcement? In the Agent 47 movie, US Marines make an arrest just in front of the building of the US embassy in Germany, so that seems like the mission country does have law enforcement power within the embassy grounds, but some other source than that not-so-realistic movie would be appreciated.Assuming point 2 is correct, and a suspect is arrested, what happens next? If the suspect were to be moved to the mission country's sovereign soil (which the embassy is not), would that country's laws allow them to be prosecuted, or would the court consider the act they committed to have been done in foreign sovereign territory ?Still assuming point 2 is correct, what would be the conditions for moving the suspect from the embassy (within the host country) to the mission country? can the host country forbid it?Finally, what happens if, say, a hostage-taking attack prevents anyone from the embassy to communicate the permission given in point 1, and the law enforcement capacities from point 2 (from the mission country) are not capable of responding (because they are incapacitated for example)?The most extreme legal response would be for the host country to revoke diplomatic credentials for the diplomatic mission, and to invade it with its own law enforcement after a given period of time. Is there another way? For example, can a mission-country diplomat (the minister for foreign affairs for example) provide a point-1 authorization from abroad, without consent from the ambassador? Can the mission country send troops to the embassy through the host country? Can the host country \"lend\" troops to the mission country's command?","answer":"I assume that applies only without the consent of the head of the diplomatic mission, but is that right?Yes.  The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations is quite clear on that.  Article 22(1) (emphasis added):The premises of the mission shall be inviolable. The agents of the receiving State may not enterthem, except with the consent of the head of the mission.<ol start='2'>What about the mission country's law enforcement?Agents of the sending state can do pretty much whatever the sending state wants when they are on the premises of the mission (including ), and even to some extent outside the premises of the mission, because they have personal immunity.  Such an arrest could lead to a diplomatic incident, though, so they have to behave responsibly.  The status of such an arrest in the law of the receiving state is not regulated by the convention and probably varies depending on the local law and perhaps bilateral agreements.<ol start='3'>Assuming point 2 is correct, and a suspect is arrested, what happens next? If the suspect were to be moved to the mission country's sovereign soil (which the embassy is not), would that country's laws allow them to be prosecuted, or would the court consider the act they committed to have been done in foreign sovereign territory?That depends on the law of the country in question.  Many countries assert at least some extraterritorial jurisdiction (over their foreign missions and otherwise), so a court could claim jurisdiction over a crime even if it was committed in foreign territory.<ol start='4'>Still assuming point 2 is correct, what would be the conditions for moving the suspect from the embassy (within the host country) to the mission country? can the host country forbid it?Yes.  The host country retains control over its territory, including its airspace.  There have been attempts to smuggle people in the diplomatic &quot;bag,&quot; but this is an abuse of the convention, which provides that the diplomatic bag &quot;may contain only diplomatic documents or articles intended for official use.&quot;Finally, what happens if, say, a hostage-taking attack prevents anyone from the embassy to communicate the permission given in point 1, and the law enforcement capacities from point 2 (from the mission country) are not capable of responding (because they are incapacitated for example)? The most extreme legal response would be for the host country to revoke diplomatic credentials for the diplomatic mission, and to invade it with its own law enforcement after a given period of time. Is there another way?The sending country's foreign minister can give permission to the receiving country to enter the premises.  You can't just revoke the diplomatic credentials and have immediate access, because that would allow regular end-runs around the immunity provisions (Article 45).For example, can a mission-country diplomat (the minister for foreign affairs for example) provide a point-1 authorization from abroad, without consent from the ambassador?The convention doesn't seem to say this explicitly, but since the foreign minister is the ambassador's boss, yes.Can the mission country send troops to the embassy through the host country?Only if the receiving country allows it.Can the host country &quot;lend&quot; troops to the mission country's command?By mutual consent, yes, though it would more likely be some sort of joint operation whereby both countries would have to agree on the orders being given."}
{"question":"TL;DRMy COO sent me a contract that would amend an existing employment term (salary). I raised concerns regarding the terms of the contact. COO explicitly told meyou don't need to put it in writing.With respect to New York State \/ New York City employment or contact law, is it strictly legal to suggest or instruct employees not to put contract concerns in writing?BackgroundYesterday my CEO announced via email that they made the decision to cut salaries. My COO responded to that email to everyone individually asking them to sign an attached document by EOD the following day. The attached document was a contract that would reduce my salary by 20% with no other changes to other existing employment terms (e.g. my employment contract). The next day the COO and I had a  call discussing the email and attached document. In that call I expressed concerns regarding the terms of the contract. When the COO expressed that they would bring it up w\/ the CEO I said that I'd put my concerns in writing. In response to that the COO saidyou don't need to put it in writing.Obviously this is a red flag. At best the COO suggested to not document the concern. AT worst it was an implied instruction to not document the concern. Additionally, I was explicitly raising concerns over the terms of a proposed contract that would change my existing employment contract.ErrataI'm employed in New York City. So New York City, New York State, and United States law would apply here.My employment is not unionizedQuestionWith respect to United States \/ New York State \/ New York City employment or contract law, is it strictly legal to suggest employees not to put contract concerns in writing?Answers\/Responses to comments(Creating this ahead of time in case there is any more explanations or details required)Put it in writing(I'm answering this pre-emptively)Immediately after the call I did put my concerns in writing.","answer":"The statement 'you don't need to put it in writing' is not an instruction, and should not be interpreted as on in lieu of other evidence (e.g. the follow-up question 'you don't want to get fired, do you?'). It is, at best, a recognition that your concerns have already been noted (and at worst, a ham-handed threat).In the context of an at-will non-union position, it is legal for a boss to directly demand 'take it or leave it, no back-talk allowed'. The reduction in salary can't go below the statutory minimum, or otherwise circumvent any laws, but assuming that the new salary is per se legal, they can demand that you accept it and not argue.If this were a government position, there is a potential (but not guaranteed) First Amendment issue."}
{"question":"Imagine a website which requires users to register in order to use all its features. In order to avoid exposure to GDPR complains, would any of the following tactics work?Ask the user for their country of residence, and offer a list with EU countries not in itAsk the user for their country of residence, and display an error message if an EU country is selectedPractically, suppose a certain John Smith from Germany registers as John Smith from Arizona, US, and then requests a copy of their personal data under GDPR right of access, or complains about the collected data being excessive. Could his request\/complain be dismissed on the ground that the website doesn't have any data concerning John Smith from Germany?","answer":"Whether GDPR applies does not depend on the country of residence. Instead, GDPR applies to a non-EU site or service if the data controller offers products or services to people in the EU (see Art 3(2) GDPR). This depends solely on the behaviour and intent of the data controller \/ the provider of the website \u2013 compare also the discussion of the targeting criterion in .While your proposed measures might not be entirely ineffective (in that they document an intent to not serve people in the EU), they are both unnecessarily restrictive and overly lax. For example, they would unnecessarily prevent EU tourists in the US from registering but would nevertheless allow US tourists in the EU. For the targeting criterion, it matters whether the data subject is in the EU at the time of the offer, not at all what their residency is. Even if a person who is currently in the EU registers with your service, that doesn't necessarily mean that you are targeting people in the EU.Instead of implementing signup restrictions, a better strategy might be to clarify in the copy on your website that you are only targeting the domestic US market, not the European market with your services. I have discussed this in more detail in an If you have a site where GDPR doesn't apply, and you receive a GDPR data subject request, you shouldn't deny it on the basis that the user must have lied \u2013 instead you can deny it on the basis that GDPR just doesn't apply to you."}
{"question":"This question is not about politics, it's purely about law.Recently, a number of companies announced that they will be terminating contracts with anyone who has Russian registration.One example is IONOS web and domain hosting:Ukraine Conflict \u2013 Cancellation of Your AccountDear XXX,As you may already be aware from IONOS's public statements, IONOS has made the difficult decision to no longer provide services to Russian and Belarusian customers. While we understand that you may not personally support the war in Ukraine or the policies which led up to the war, it's important that IONOS make clear our support for the people and country of Ukraine. With that in mind, your account will be terminated effective 16\/03\/22, so please transfer all of your data, domain names, and any related email addresses to another provider no later than the termination date. After the termination date, any domains which are not transferred will resolve to an error page until the domain expiry date, and any data associated with your account will be deleted.If you believe your website provides information services that are critical to the defense of Ukraine or which assist in ensuring the safety and well-being of the Ukrainian people, please reach out to us directly and an IONOS representative will review your site as a possible exception to the company's general policy on terminations. Please note that IONOS will make any such determination in its sole and unfettered discretion, without any obligation to you.In case you need support, please contact our Customer Service team at:1-484-254-5555.We stand with Ukraine!Here's what seems to be their Terms&Conditions:I read through it, and I find these clauses remotely relevant:IONOS may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason, with or without cause, upon thirty days' written noticeIn my understanding, this doesn't apply, because they're giving only 8 days of prior notice.You represent and warrant that you are not a national or resident of Burma\/Myanmar, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Serbia, Sudan, and Syria or any other country subject to U.S. Treasury Department embargo restrictionsTo my knowledge, Russia is not embargoed.In the event of \"force majeure\" (as defined below), IONOS may terminate this Agreement without liability to you. For purposes of the Agreement, \"force majeure\" shall mean circumstances or occurrences beyond IONOS's reasonable control, whether or not foreseeable at the time of entering into the Agreement, in consequence of which IONOS cannot reasonably be required to perform its obligations hereunder or otherwise perform its obligations under the Agreement.IONOS is an internet service, which to my knowledge is rendered outside of Russian soil. Therefore I don't see a way to declare that IONOS is \"cannot reasonably be required to perform its obligations\" in such situation. Also, by the time of their decision, there is no war on Russian soil.","answer":"IONOS terms and conditions are written in such a way that IONOS can terminate accounts for many different reasons. This is very common for many types of service industries; they want as many ways out their contracts with customers as possible to cover all possible contingencies. IONOS users agreed to the terms and conditions, even if the users didn't read it when opening an account.Yes, IONOS may not be giving 30 days notice, but if you want to argue about that, you have agreed to binding arbitration in Pennsylvania, according to the terms and conditions.But we may assume they are relying on the force majeure clause:Such circumstances or occurrences include, but are not limited to:acts of God, war, civil war, insurrection, fires, floods, labordisputes, epidemics, governmental regulations and\/or similar acts,embargoes, termination&quot;War&quot; doesn't mean specifically war on Russian soil; the statement is purposefully vague so that it can mean a war anywhere. And &quot;...civil war, insurrection...&quot; covers the rest of the contingencies when it comes to armed conflict.Russian citizens may have other rights under national and consumer laws, but again, users agreed to arbitration in Pennsylvania, not in Russian, and unless you're spending lots of money for IONOS services, it's probably not worth contesting the closure of an account."}
{"question":"So, the second season of Daredevil came out today, and internet lowlife that I am I'm already a few episodes in.A pivotal part of the plot involves a criminal who police are well aware would almost certainly be killed (by a maniac they're currently investigating), who is willing to testify against plenty of people to qualify for witness protection. However, they make his witness protection status conditional upon wearing a wire and being directly involved in a sting, which would expose him to further personal bodily risk.Since that amounts to extortion, it doesn't feel like it should  be legal to do. They're forcing someone to put themselves in harm's way under threat of (almost certain) execution by a third party....However, I know that, for various reasons, the law often violently conflicts with what's ethically justifiable, so I'm curious whether that's actually something police can do.Can police make their protection dependent upon direct involvement in a sting operation?I recognize that there's a difference between witness protection and regular police protection, and am curious how the above applies in each case. Within the context of the show, it's implied that both witness protection and regular police protection would be denied if the witness were to decline to participate. In case it's relevant, the show takes place in New York state.And yes, I know that TV represents law inaccurately all the time. Don't worry; this isn't the first of a long list of TV-related questions.

{"question":"What protections does Netherlands provide to users of online platforms incorporated in their country? Currently, the United States treats online platforms as private property and so the users are granted no rights of freedom of speech on those platforms. Does the Netherlands provide any additional rights over the United States?I know that European countries have, in some cases, began treating those platforms as public utilities where users are granted rights. If so, are these rights extended only to citizens of the Netherlands, or are these rights universal?","answer":"Freedom of speech in the constitutionI think this is a very broad question, but I'll attempt an answer. To my knowledge, there is no specific Dutch law that considers freedom of speech on the internet. Instead, there is one article in the Dutch constitution that considers freedom of speech and a prohibition on censorship. That's  (link in Dutch).It consists of 4 sections. The first deals with freedom of speech in print, the second deals with radio and television, the third deals with (translated by me) revealing thoughts or feelings through means other than the aforementioned and the fourth states that the aforementioned sections don't apply to commercial advertisements.Since you are asking about freedom of speech online, the third section applies. The section states that no permission is needed to reveal those thoughts or feelings through means other than the aforementioned but it adds two conditions:In Dutch: &quot;behoudens ieders verantwoordelijkheid volgens de wet&quot;. This means that the freedom is subject to one's responsibilities under the law. In other words, other laws may curtail one's freedom under this section. This phrase is also included in the first two sections.The second condition which is specific to this section is that the law may restrict access to performances (vertoningen in Dutch; not sure if it translates well) to people under the age of 16 to protect good moral (goede zeden in Dutch; again not sure if it translates well).Restrictions under the lawSo the above about constitutional freedom of speech doesn't tell you a lot, it's very general. To answer your question you'd need to know what specific exceptions there are. These exceptions don't need to be specific to statements made online, if it's not allowed in public then the same rule would apply online.To give these exceptions I'll summarize the information on .Hate speech and calling for criminal actsThe Amnesty article starts with some information on articles of criminal law: forbids hate against or discrimination of people based on race, religion, gender, sexual preference, or mental handicap.According to  this covers holocaust denial (considered unlawful discrimination) but not homophobia (when it expresses fear of or aversion to someone's sexual orientation).: calling for a criminal act or violent action against public order.Some interesting jurisprudence regarding your question and articles 131 and 132 is this case: . It's a Dutch Supreme Court case that considers calls for 'participation in the armed jihad' in the context of the war in Syria. The calls were made in Facebook posts (containing photos of dead victims, photos of ISIS flags, and statements in Dutch supporting jihad). The linked ruling confirms that these posts were in violation of articles 131 and 132 and that the posts were not protected under religious freedom nor as freedom of speech.Libel  are also limitations on freedom of speech, even online.Preventing publication of military secretsAccording to the  censorship (as in ruling some statement against the law before publication) is not something Dutch courts may normally do. It names one exception: when military secrets may be revealed. Then a court may prevent publication, unless the military secrets are such gross violations of human rights that publication would be warranted.Rights on a platformI know that European countries have, in some cases, began treating those platforms as public utilities where users are granted rights.I'm not sure what you're referring to here but I don't think it refers to freedom speech. In any case, after some googling I found a case that is about this: .On the other hand, the ruling also points to the service agreement between Facebook and the user. Part of those terms and conditions are entered as facts in the proceedings. Since it's a civil case, I assume users might derive some rights from that if the agreement touches on that.Another thing that sounds familiar (based on that quote from your question) is . Like in the US, that's mostly about network providers having different rules for different content, which isn't allowed in most cases under net neutrality. I don't think there's a freedom of speech angle to that."}
{"question":"I often see freelancers suggesting to other freelancers to use the small claim courts to get paid when the client is in another country. Already with the small claim court, there's a maximum amount allowed so I'm not talking about $10,000USD but amounts like $500-3000 USD.I know this greatly depends on a lot of factors but to my knowledge small claims court cannot be used to sue someone who is not physically in the country\/jurisdiction where the case will be held. I read all sort of things on some Stacks here which I think are wrong such as 'get someone to represent you in the small claim court' for this kind of situation (overseas contract of small value).From what I understand from my research, a case can be heard in civil court if represented by an attorney, but prosecution and collection can be so costly and risky that it's not considered worthwhile on small debts below $10,000.If you need an example of countries, let's say 2 very different countries like Pakistan and USA.So my question is:Can a freelancer who works for a client overseas use sue for payment in small claims court, with or without representation?  Or can representation in court be made only through an attorney?Does the answer change if the 2 countries are part of the EU?","answer":"  Can suits be filed in small claims courts from overseas?You can bring a suit in any court of 'competent jurisdiction', that is, the court in question will decide if it has jurisdiction and if the parties have standing.For a US small-claims court (which I infer is what you are asking), there must be some relevant connection between the parties or the contract and the state in which it is brought. A contract between a Pakistani and an Australian for work done in Mexico is unlikely to be found to be within the jurisdiction of any US court. However, if one of the parties is a US Delaware corporation and the work is done in California then both Delaware and California courts will have jurisdiction.A further question is what law the court will apply. For your US\/Pakistani case, it may be heard in a US court under Pakistani law or a Pakistani court under US law. Contracts may be explicit about what law they are made under but each court will decide for itself taking the parties wishes into account (or not). Note that some laws are not-excludable by contract, so that the relevant law might be Pakistani but with certain specific Californian laws applicable.Enforcement is another issue, if the defendant has no assets in the jurisdiction where the judgement is made, how are you going to collect?  Can a freelancer who works for a client overseas use sue for payment in small claims court, with or without representation?Subject to the above, yes. However, the freelancer will need to physically attend the court if representing themselves and brief council if not.  Or can representation in court be made only through an attorney?Well, it is said:  A person who represents themselves has a fool for a client.Going to court is a game. Lawyers know the rules and know how to play to win. Good lawyers know when not to play. Generally, a lay person doesn't: would you back yourself in a tennis match against an ATP professional?"}
{"question":"This is based on a situation in a mystery novel. In the novel a lawyer receives an envelope addressed to him by a client, in the client's handwriting, which the lawyer knows well. But the letter inside is not addressed to the lawyer, or indeed to anyone. Enclosed are sheets of paper with a watermark of the sort used in printing paper money, strongly suggesting a counterfeiting operation. The unaddressed and unsigned note is consistent with the idea of a counterfeiting operation. The note is also in the client's distinctive handwriting.The lawyer assumes that the contents of the envelope were placed there by a mistake of the client, and were intended to be sent to a confederate of the client in this illegal scheme. He further assumes that a letter intended for the lawyer was sent to the confederate.The lawyer had not previously known or suspected that the client was engaged in forgery or any unlawful activity.The lawyer decides to treat this as a confidential and privileged matter. But the narrator remarks that he is obviously wrong to do so. One passage reads:The obvious inference was that the letter which had come to Penfield [the lawyer] contained incriminating matter. That would explain everything. For if Penfield had thus stumbled on evidence of a crime, either committed or contemplated, he would have to choose between denouncing the criminal or keeping the matter to himself. But he was not entitled to keep it to himself; for, other considerations apart, this was not properly a client's secret. It had not been communicated to him: he had discovered it by accident. He was therefore not bound to secrecy, and he could not, consequently, claim a lawyer's privilege. In short, if he had discovered a crime and chose to suppress his discovery, he was, in effect, an accessory, before or after the fact, as the case might be; and he would necessarily keep the secret because he would not dare to divulge it.(Source: Chapter IV of The Shadow of the Wolf by R. Austin Freeman, first published in 1925, and now out of copyright. Freeman died in 1943. See )The novel is set in England, roughly in 1925.My question is, would the contents of the envelope be considered privileged? Would the lawyer be required to divulge it if asked by the police or in a court? Would he be required to report the matter to the police on his own? What difference, if any does it make that the client apparently did not intend to send these contents to the lawyer? Are the answers different in 1925 England, 1925 US (say New York) 2020 England, or 2020 New York?I know that a lawyer cannot regard as privileged advice on how to commit a crime, or plans for a future crime. I understand that a statement by a client that the client has committed a crime in the past is privileged. But what about this sort of unintended disclosure by the client?","answer":" - present day...Would the contents of the envelope be considered privileged?No  Although it is possible to argue that the letter is a communication to the lawyer (albeit by mistake) its purpose is not in relation to seeking or receiving legal advice, so it fails to meet the definition of legal privilege::Legal advice privilege protects confidential communications between lawyers and their clients for the purposes of giving or obtaining legal advice.Litigation privilege protects confidential communications between lawyers, clients and third parties made for the purposes of litigation, either actual or contemplated.Would the lawyer be required to divulge it if asked by the police or in a court?Yes, No, Maybe  If the lawyer is a suspect\/defendant then there is no requirement to answer any questions whatsoever.  Similarly, there is no obligation on a witness to answer questions unless a statutory provision has been triggered, such as the lawyer being given a  Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 .Would he be required to report the matter to the police on his own?Yes  Although there is no general requirement to report a crime (of this nature) to the police, the lawyer's profession is in the &quot;regulated sector&quot; which requires  to be submitted to the authorities:... in respect of information that comes to them in the course of their business if they know, or suspect or have reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting, that a person is engaged in, or attempting, ...What difference, if any does it make that the client apparently did not intend to send these contents to the lawyer?None that I can see \/>ETA The status of legal privilege in 1925 seems to have been the same as now, and this article, under the heading History offers this in support:The common law principle of legal professional privilege is of extremely long standing. The earliest recorded instance of the principle in English case-law dates from 1577 in the case of? ([1576] EngR 10 (&amp; Ors))"}
{"question":"If Montana police want to question a Canadian citizen about a crime committed in the US, could the Canadian be compelled to cooperate?","answer":"This assumes the Canadian is in Canada and is unwilling to testify because if those two facts are not the case, then there is no reason to be asking a question. The US is a party to the Convention of 18 March 1970 on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters (aka the Evidence Convention). Unfortunately for you, Canada is not. Nor is Canada a party to the Inter-American treaty dealing with the same issue. Thus, when a potential witness is unwilling to cooperate, you must rely on . This is, by the way, how you would go about obtaining evidence in any foreign country not party to a treaty on the taking of evidence with the United States. The process of executing this can be costly and lengthy (a year or more perhaps). The reason for that is because this is done via diplomatic channels in the interest of preserving international comity (goodwill, friendly relations between countries) where a relevant treaty and process does not exist. You should include in any letters rogatory:- a statement saying that in the interest of justice a request is being made for international judicial assistance- a summary of the case, including identification of parties and the claim(s) and relief sought- type of case- the sort of assistance you would like (do you want testimony? document production? service of process?)- name, address, title, etc., of the person from which you are seeking to collect this from- list of questions you intend to ask- statement from requesting court (where the litigation is filed) expressing the court's agreement to reciprocate this sort of assistance if such occasion should arise- statement from requesting court or party that costs incurred fulfilling this request will be reimbursed It must be signed by a judge. Then, along with relevant fees which can be found under the Schedule of Fees at 22 CFR 22.1, send your request to:ATTN: Judicial Assistance OfficerUS Department of StateOffice of Legal Affairs, (CA\/OCS\/L)SA-17, 10th Floor2201 C St. NWWashington, DC 20522  Include a cover letter with the details outlined on the State Dept.'s website.Then, the State Department will transmit the request to the Canadian authorities through diplomatic channels. Then, the foreign court will send the executed request back to the State Department and you will be notified. NOTE: please check the State Dept.'s website and\/or consult an attorney if you move forward with this. The above is fairly detailed but should not be considered legal advice nor should it be relied upon in your legal proceeding.  the exact procedures will vary by jurisdiction and I'm not sure where in Canada may be relevant to you. That said, in some civil law countries, the foreign judge may end up questioning the witness with the US attorneys submitting written questions to the judge. Just a heads up there, too. "}
{"question":"In the following video; A Pueblo, CO L.E.O. illegally detained an individual while taking video outside of a police department on a public sidewalk. The individual sued the city, PD and they settled for a sum of $41,000.00. The PD edited their policy regarding public recording and I would assume informed\/trained their officers on the updated policy.If a second incident of illegal detainment while video recording in public occurred. Would this increase the payout from the city\/PD in the event of a settlement? Would the Officer be personally liable?","answer":"Settlements are negotiated, and are based on the perceived strength of the case, the estimates of the parties as to the probable size of an award of damages should the case go to trial, and perceived PR issues\/reputational harms. A second case within a short time might be perceived as a systemic problem which might raise the amount of a damage award, or make punitive damages more likely. On the other hand, it might be regarded as 'old news' and reduce the PR pressure for a settlement, and thus the amount offered. Much would depend on the precise circumstances, and any perceived aggravating or mitigating factors. It would also depend on the personal attitude of whoever is doing the negotiating. No one can reasonably predict what might be offered or accepted as a settlement. In a Federal section 1983 civil rights suit, (42 U.S.C. 1983) a specifically named officer or officers can be found liable. Indeed, in most cases a specific individual (or individuals) must be named in such suits for the suit to go forward. However, the employer or any relevant union may and often do reimburse an officer for damages awarded in such suits. That depends on local policies and judgements. See  reads:  Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer's judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable. For the purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia.The words 'Every person' at the start impose personal liability. Note that no words in the statute directly impose liability on any governmental organization, such as a police department or city. The liability is strictly personal under sec 1983."}
{"question":"Is there any way a state could legally secede from the United States?","answer":"YesAfter the Civil War the Supreme Court ruled that the Acts of Succession of the southern states were unconstitutional. That is, they were and had always been part of the United States even if they said they weren't.So, a Constitutional amendment that allows secession would need to be passed granting that right. This would be similar to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union that allowed the UK to leave the EU.There would need to be a way of determining the exact process because all states contain a lot of Federal installations with some western states being more than half Federally owned. This could be in the amendment but, more likely, it would simply empower Congress to determine the process.Is this legal? Absolutely. Is there any real chance of this happening soon? Absolutely not."}
{"question":"My friend (buyer) tried to purchase a car from a private individual (seller). They agreed on a price, drew up a contract, and signed it. The buyer paid the seller the deposit they agreed on.The seller is now feeling remorse or perhaps found a better price. Now the seller is refusing to sell the car or even return the deposit.Can the buyer take any legal action against the seller? In case it matters: both agents are in the United States with international student visas.","answer":"Nope, the seller can't refuse &quot;to sell&quot;. They have sold it.They sold it right at the moment the contract was created (which, depending on where they were, would not necessarily even need to be in writing).The deposit is irrelevant. What is relevant is that now your friend must pay the full balance, and the seller must hand over the car. If the seller does not do that, that is a breach of contract which can be fixed by going to the court and obtaining an order to hand the car over."}
{"question":"This is in Hunt county, Texas, US. I had signed as tenant and took a house for rent. With couple other person's listed as occupants. The person's have not signed but just listed.But the occupant has paid his share of rent (1\/3) for the current month. So am I legally eligible to ask one of the occupant to vacate immediately before the current month ends or call the cops for force eviction?","answer":"You can ask him, but don't expect the police to be helping that fast.According to , unless you have a specific reason (like they were convicted of using the property for prostitution) that allows you to only give 10 day's notice.  Only if they stay beyond that month's notice period would you be able to give the 3 day's notice.  After the 3 days have passed and they are still on the property, you can file an eviction lawsuit.According to the , rule 510.4, the date of the trial must be at least 10 days after the lawsuit is filed (but no more than 21 days.)  You don't pick the date; your local court dockets the trial.  Let's assume they docket the trial for the minimum of 10 days out, the trial finishes on the same day it starts, and you get a judgement in your favor, and let's assume the person doesn't file an appeal.According to Texas property code 24.0061, a writ of possession may not be issued before the sixth day after the date on which the judgment for possession is rendered unless certain conditions are met.  And once the writ is executed, a minimum of 24 hour's notice is given by the police that the person really really has to leave.  After that, the police will actually remove them.So, overall, it's going to be a minimum of 3+10+6+1 = 20 days between when you first give them written notice and when the police will kick them out, and I would be surprised if you could actually do it that fast.  If you need to give a month's notice first, then even if that month is February it becomes at least 48 days."}
{"question":"Would I be correct in saying that police have a duty to fairly represent the facts to a judge when they attempt to get a warrant to search premises? Is there some sort of oversight in regard to how warrants are issued? Or is the oversight having your lawyer contest the validity of the search at your trial?If a judge thinks the police are, either through neglect or incompetence, withholding information that would keep a judge from issuing a warrant what would happen then? Is this grounds for a policeperson losing his or her job or can a judge just then choose not to issue any further warrants with that department, making there job just that bit harder?","answer":"You are correct. A judge may only issue a warrant when it is supported by an affidavit, in which the officer seeking the warrant swears under oath to the facts supporting the warrant. Lying on the affidavit would constitute perjury.But judges very frequently just rubber-stamp the warrants without meaningfully reviewing the affidavits, so the primary form of oversight would be the defendant's Fourth Amendment challenge asserting that the warrant wasn't supported by probable cause.If a judge does review the warrant application and finds the officer's statements not to be credible, he can refuse to sign the warrant, and he is free to also carry that credibility determination to subsequent warrants sought by the same officer or other officers in his department."}
{"question":"The Bank of America iPhone app's icon has a very small ? next to the logo (shown below). The ?, barely visible in the blown-up picture below, is reduced to a small, vaguely pinkish dot on any device where the app may be found running, making its interior \"R\" practically indiscernible.I am wondering whether the implied presence of this symbol is still capable of carrying any legal force considering that the symbol itself cannot be made out.","answer":"The symbol is an indicator to you that the trademark is registered. Obviously, its registration status does not vary with the size of the symbol, so the mark remains registered.Of course, trademark protection also requires the holder to take reasonable steps to police infringement. If the holder failed to use the symbol, that would count against him in an infringement action. But you did in fact recognize the symbol, so there's no indication that Bank of America is doing anything less than what it is supposed to do to maintain its protection."}
{"question":"I have just signed a new lease. The leasing agent says they countersign my lease after I move in. I still have a few days before I move in. Is this common\/legal? Does it not expose the lessee to some risk?","answer":"In any legal dealing, there is always some risk. The signature constitutes definitive proof that you have a contract, but you still have a contract, because you have mutual acceptance. A far-fetched scenario is that the lessor could allege that they did not agree to the terms of he contract with you (perhaps claiming that you obtained a blank contract form from them and filled in details, but they didn't agree to those details). However, if they allow you to move in, that is sufficient constructive evidence of a contract, so they could not argue &quot;We didn't agree to this&quot;. The main risk would be your lack of proof that they ever agreed to lease the place to you (no emails, no texts, no witnesses, no legally-recorded conversations). There may be specific state laws about providing a copy of the rental agreement, such as  provides a collection of relevant state laws, though you may have to dig a bit because this is a hook into all of the laws about leases and not just about providing copies."}
{"question":"In many cases towns and cities have unconstitutional laws on their books. For example, recently the Supreme Court ruled that blanket give-all-records-to-police hotel ordinances were unconstitutional. Nevertheless, many cities and town have ordinances that require hotels to record extensive information on all their guests and to allow police to search those records whenever the police want without a warrant or even notice of any kind.So, the question is how can a hotel challenge such ordinances and have them voided by the courts without breaking them and criminalizing themselves?Update: I found an article on this subject dating back to 1967 (Declaratory Relief in the Criminal Law, Harvard Law Review, Vol. 80, No. 7 (May, 1967), pp. 1490-1513 (24 pages)). So, answers to this question could be seen as modern extensions to this paper with specific emphasis on civil or regulatory law (not criminal and not private).","answer":"There are two cases to consider.If there is some evidence that the city intends to enforce the ordinance, then the business can go to court for an injunction preventing the city from doing so, if they can show that such enforcement would harm them (e.g. by making them impose a records policy they don't want).  They don't have to risk arrest by actually violating the ordinance first.  In granting the injunction, the court would likely rule that this particular ordinance is unconstitutional, which seems to be the &quot;voiding&quot; that you're looking for.If the city shows no signs of wanting to enforce the ordinance (e.g. they are well aware that it is unconstitutional and not legally enforceable), then a request for an injunction would likely be dismissed as not .  Courts do not want to waste their time on cases where there is no real dispute between the parties, or on issuing orders for an entity not to do something that they weren't going to do anyway.  It's understandable that the business might wish for an explicit ruling anwyay, in case they fear that the city will change its mind tomorrow and start cracking down, but unfortunately for them, courts do not agree that this is worth doing.Note in either case the ordinance will remain on the books until such time as the town council (or other relevant legislative body) should vote to repeal it.  Courts have no power to make that happen, no matter how unconstitutional the ordinance might be.  So the business might find it more effective to petition the council for a repeal."}
{"question":"I saw this screenshot floating around for a California jury duty online questionnaire.

However, for the purposes of this post, let's ignore cases where one cannot recall one's marital status on their own, and only consider the case where it would legally be unknown.I think one instance is if someone's working on getting their marriage annulled and doesn't know whether the process is complete or not.

{"question":"Two impeachment articles were drafted by the House and then sent to the SenateAbuse of PowerObstruction of Congress.Now say the senate looks at the original articles and underlying evidence and acquits the president.Then later on, the House discovers more evidence which makes for a much tighter case and again draft the same articles (with different evidence) and sends to the senate.Can the senate dismiss the charges due to double jeopardy since they already acquitted the president on the same charges for the same situation?","answer":"Double jeopardy in its usual sense wouldn't attach because impeachment is not a criminal proceeding, which is the only thing double jeopardy applies to (esoteric estoppel matters not withstanding).  You might recall that OJ Simpson was tried and acquitted of murder in a criminal court, and then subsequently tried and found liable in a civil court for those murders.  There was no double jeopardy protections of which he could avail himself.But the constitution says that the Senate shall have the sole power to try impeachments, so for the most part we can expect that whatever they say goes.  So they can dismiss for any reason they desire, in principle.  The impeachment of Senator Blount is one example: the House impeached him, and on the same day the Senate expelled him under their constitutional power to do so, and then dismissed the impeachment for lack of jurisdiction (arguing that Congress members cannot be impeached; the impeachment was otherwise still relevant after his expulsion because it could result in preventing him from gaining office again).  The costs here are political: in your hypothetical situation with very strong evidence, if popular opinion turns too strongly in favor of conviction then refusal to do so may cost the Senators and their party in subsequent elections. Attempts to argue arcane technicalities might not save you at the ballot box.Under existing impeachment precedent (as well as Congressional rules precedents), the courts would be loathe to get involved by default. Though if the action was sufficiently egregious (not even superficially resembling what a judge might call a trial, say) maybe they would feel judicial intervention and action was warranted and justified.  But that's purely speculative."}
{"question":"In the May 26, 2021 video  CNN's senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig mentions the following in a background piece outlining the basics of a US Special Grand Jury. After about 01:17 they say:It is a one-sided presentation; it's only the prosecutor, the grand jurors, and a court reporter. There's no judge, there's no defense lawyer. So it is extremely one-sided; you hear this expression the grand jury would indict a ham sandwich' there's some truth to that; it's not an adversarial process like you'd have at trial.and the origin of the 'ham sandwich' reference is mentioned in Wikipedia's :[...]Grand jurors also often lack the ability and knowledge to judge sophisticated cases and complicated federal laws. This puts them at the mercy of very well trained and experienced federal prosecutors. Grand jurors often hear only the prosecutor's side of the case and are usually persuaded by them. Grand juries almost always indict people on the prosecutor's recommendation. An unnamed Rochester defense lawyer was quoted in a 1979 newspaper article claiming that a prosecutor could get a grand jury to \"indict a ham sandwich\", a saying subsequently repeated by the chief judge of New York State's highest court, Sol Wachtler. And William J. Campbell, a former federal district judge in Chicago, noted: \"[T]oday, the grand jury is the total captive of the prosecutor who, if he is candid, will concede that he can indict anybody, at any time, for almost anything, before any grand jury.\" (references therein)Question: With only prosecutor(s) and a court reporter, are jurors at all instructed to not simply \"rubber stamp\" the prosecution's desire to indict?

But grand juries don't operate on a preponderance of the evidence standard. The sole evidentiary standard in a grand jury proceeding is the lower &quot;probable cause&quot; standard. Likewise, lots of evidence which would not be admissible in a criminal trial is admissible in a grand jury proceeding. The main kind of evidence not admissible in a grand jury proceeding is evidence which is &quot;privileged&quot; against court disclosure (e.g. attorney-client communications).If so, by who?The prosecutor and the handbook linked above.Is there a standard &quot;script&quot; or talking points for such instruction?Prosecuting attorney's offices in jurisdictions that usually use grand juries typically have a set of forms.In federal practice, ) that his a matter of public record. There is some case law on what the content of an indictment must look like and on the grand jury process.Some state and local jurisdictions with routine use of grand juries probably have standard court forms for certain parts of grand jury process, and there may be some standard forms in local rules for some federal courts. But there isn't a national judicial branch sanctioned official set of court forms for grand juries in the federal criminal justice system.The rather lax supervision of grand juries reflects the fact that they are a road bump in the criminal justice process with a pretty low threshold to meet that faces sterner tests later in the process:Is there probable cause to support the charges requested by theprosecutor against the named defendants?About half of U.S. states allow prosecutors to do this without a grand jury approval, unilaterally.Every grand jury indictment must either be consented to by the defense, or approved by the court following a trial with a much higher proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard, to result in a conviction resulting in the imposition of punishment.A judge in a separate hearing determines if there will be pre-trial detention or bail conditions prior to the criminal trial."}

{"question":"I read on one of the COVID-19 testing websites ( but the following text can only be viewed but booking an appointment) [emphasis is mine]:Free testing is available to all County residents, regardless of insurance status.If you have health insurance, your health plan is required to pay for approved COVID-19 tests, according to the State of California. By providing your insurance information, this allows the County to be reimbursed for the cost of the tests from your insurance company. Insurance companies cannot bill individuals or charge any co-payments for COVID-19 tests. Your test is no cost or free for you.This causes me: the first bold section seems to say that only approved COVID-19 tests must be fully reimbursed, whereas the second bold section bold says that all COVID-19 tests must be fully reimbursed.Must all COVID-19 tests be fully reimbursed by health insurances in California, United States?","answer":"Must all COVID-19 tests be fully reimbursed by health insurances in California, United States?That is not what the excerpt conveys. The second statement in bold only reflects that the insurer is not allowed to shift to the insured --or policy holder-- the cost of the test, but that is in the context of (i.e., same paragraph about) tests for which an appointment is booked with the state\/county.It would be improper for the state to inform about the no-cost protection only to the insured people who happen to book an appointment, since that tends to exclude every insured who did not engage in the state\/county program (whether because the insured got tested outside that program and\/or did not want to risk being billed by the insurer).It is also unclear from the excerpt what &quot;approved&quot; means. For instance, approval might depend on validation that the person is truly a resident of that county. Testing a non-resident might forfeit the state's\/county's right to reimbursement from the insurer for that specific test. Another possibility is that approval depends also on test's compliance with a set of specs (such as the number of amplifications of the person's sample)."}
{"question":"The United States Constitution,  reads in part,The Congress shall have Power To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin.From this passage, I understand that only Congress has the power to create and regulate currency (a means of payment and a store of value) in the United States. Congress may also delegate some or all parts of this power, which they have done in favor of the Federal Reserve. By that understanding, any instrument used as a means of payment and a store of value not produced by Congress or under Congressional mandate violates Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. A recent example of such a violation is the , a privately minted coinage distributed and redeemable within the United States and backed by precious metals.Given that Congress has been explicitly given the power to coin and regulate the value of money in the United States, how  are cryptocurrencies, such as  created, distributed, and redeemed such that they have not been found unconstitutional?As a slight tangent, what laws allow for the creation and distribution of cryptocurrencies?","answer":"The Constitution only regulates the powers of the government; it doesn't directly say what the people can and can't do.  In particular, it doesn't say directly that nobody except Congress can coin money.  However, it does give the government the power to make laws, which are binding on the population.So Congress possibly could make a law forbidding cryptocurrencies, or at least regulating them, under the 'regulating the value thereof' clause.  However, they haven't done so.In the case of the Liberty Dollar, there are some specific laws that apply.  They were convicted of violating , which forbids creating or passing any physical metal coins as money (as well as other conspiracy charges, aiding and abetting, etc).  None of these laws apply to cryptocurrency because they are not physical metal coins.  Given that Congress has been explicitly given the power to coin and regulate the value of money in the United States, how are cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Basis created, distributed, and redeemed such that they have not been found unconstitutional?The power to regulate includes the power to not regulate.

Managing patients, Exams, Bills etc are all public knowledge. Specific tests that go in each exam have been made based on material read from books that I can prove.Your employer will bear the burden of proof to show you are using their trade secrets.

If you have already been sued, absolutely go get a lawyer and start figuring out whether you are in the clear (that's what it sounds like based on your perhaps biased description) or in the wrong (even if unintentionally).By the way - what is your former employer asking you to do? Pay them money? Take your site down? I wouldn't do any of it without having a lawyer tell me to but if they just want an acknowledgment or something it might be easier to get it in writing and do what they want. But I wouldn't take the site down or pay them anything without the lawyer.Note that you might be in violation of a non-compete clause separately from claims of copyright or trade secret violations. Even if it's your own code and your own ideas, even demonstrably so, you might be prevented legally from benefiting from them for some period of time and in some market. If you have a non-compete with them and you're in a jurisdiction which recognizes it as valid, you are almost certainly in violation and I'd go see that lawyer yesterday.I am not a lawyer.

In federal cases,  of the Rules of Criminal Procedure permit the defendant to apply to ask the government to pay the witness fee if they cannot afford it and the presence of the witness is necessary for an adequate defense.The other side of a case (in this example, the prosecutor) could try to impeach the witness's testimony (i.e. make him seem less credible in the eyes of the jury) by demonstrating that the witness is a 'professional witness' (i.e. fees from saying things in court are a major part of the witness's regular income).  That doesn't seem to apply to the facts you've listed, where the witness just happened to be in that place and time to observe what happened and (assuming for this question) accurately testified as to what he saw.

I can't think of any \"pure purpose\" one would have in filing an answer when a motion for dismissal is warranted.

Under rule 11b:By presenting to the court a pleading... an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances...(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;(3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.It doesn't actually say in there that the defense must investigate the sufficiency of the plaintiff's claims (although that's obviously something the defense would ordinarily want to do.) The part about making sure &quot;the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted...&quot; relates to the claims being made the party in question, not the ones being made by the other party.I can't think of any &quot;pure purpose&quot; one would have in filing an answer when a motion for dismissal is warranted.Depending on the circumstances, a party might have good reasons to not make every claim they think they're entitled to make. Perhaps they aren't sure about how the court will rule on their motion to dismiss but like their chances at trial. (Indeed, if it's a certainty the court will dismiss, then perhaps Rule 11 sanctions are in order for the plaintiff, for filing a case that was not at all warranted by the law.) Drafting a motion is time the attorney has to spend, which is an expense for their client, and it may or may not work. But maybe their motion to dismiss Count D uses the same theories as their motion to dismiss Count A, and it's now worth it to make the argument. And maybe now since the court ruled with them on Count C they're more optimistic that the court will also rule in their favor on counts A and D.If the defense delayed this motion solely to &quot;harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation&quot; then Rule 11 would be violated. But that seems unlikely. Look at the context. They're making a motion on the amended complaint. That's still rather early in the process. Given that a brand new count was added, an earlier motion to dismiss count A would not have resolved the litigation anyway, so there was no real delay caused. The costs for either side have not been significantly increased, either.Also note the phrases &quot;to the best of the person's knowledge&quot; and &quot;reasonable under the circumstances&quot;. The defendant only has 21 days to file a response after being served, and they might not even have an attorney yet when that clock starts. How much inquiry is reasonable in that time frame, especially when responding to a multi-count complaint?"}
{"question":"In the United States, what bar ethics restrictions are there on lawyers publicly commenting on ongoing legal cases in which they represent no parties?  Since different state bars might have different rules, my question could be expanded to:In general, what are the restrictions?Which states have the most extreme restrictions, and how do they differ from the general restrictions?Which states have the most lax restrictions, and how do they differ from the general restrictions?EDIT: At what point does an uninvolved lawyer's public commentary on a case constitute a legal opinion which, according to ethics rules, requires due diligence to be done by the uninvolved lawyer?  At what point does the due diligence needed become so great that it can only be done someone with access to non-public information, and thus the uninvolved lawyer is certainly violating ethic rules?  [NOTE: This isn't my understanding of bar ethics rules, but that of someone I'm arguing with.]","answer":"As George White says, it's hard to prove a negative, but in this instance, there's quite a bit of evidence supporting you. First, the ABA has standards for legal commentators but they are very weak. They say pretty much what you would expect, and, they are non-binding: they explicitly say they &quot;not intended&quot; to provide grounds for &quot;professional discipline.&quot; Second, there are articles by lawyers indicating there are no state bar standards. Taken together, the weak ABA standards and the articles should give you enough evidence to prove your case in the &quot;court of buddy opinion.&quot;The  rules on legal commentators were issued in 2013 as part of a Fair Trial and Public Discourse Black Letter. The letter covered public comments on cases by lawyers involved in the case, lawyers not involved (ie, commentators) and judicial and judicial employees.According to the ABA, the standards are:intended to provide a guide to best practices for lawyers who provide public commentary or consult on criminal cases in which they are not personally involved; (Standard 8-1.1(a)(ii))To explain what it meant by a &quot;guide to best practices,&quot; the ABA included the following caveat about the applicability of the standards:While these Standards are intended to provide a basis for the formulation of internal guidelines within lawyers' offices...they are not intended to serve as the basis in and of themselves for the imposition of professional discipline...(Standard 8-1.1(c))In other words, the ABA's rules truly are just a guide to best practices.As for the guidance itself, it does not come close to requiring &quot;due-diligence.&quot;A lawyer who is serving as a legal commentator should strive to ensure that the lawyer's commentary enhances the public's understanding of the criminal matter and of the criminal justice system generally, promotes respect for the judicial system, and does not materially prejudice the fair administration of justice, in the particular case or in general. To that end, a legal commentator should:(i) Have an understanding of the law and facts of the matter so as to be competent to serve as a commentator;(ii) Refrain from providing commentary designed to sensationalize a criminal matter; and...It may be that some states provide more stringent restrictions, but a quick search suggests they don't. Otherwise, there would not be a law review  article (from this June) giving advice on becoming a legal commentator without mentioning state bar restrictions.I'm sure if you look, you can find more evidence."}
{"question":"I recently watched a  about this incident, as well.  Barring anything being the owner's fault, the lawyer in the video said that the dealer would put in a new engine and that would be that.  He did mention about collectabity of the car could be damaged.  However, he said he would not get into that.However, I am curious.  People buy new cars as investments and not for driving.  Having matching VINs on the car and engine demands higher prices upon resale.While no one can see into the furure and no what something will actually be worth, there is no lack of evidence that certain cars will increase in value.  Some cars go up in value by orders of magnitude.  Take the Lamborghini Miura, which was $20,000 new.  Now some are worth over $2,000,000.  Of course, all this can apply to more than cars as there are other things that follow suit.I definitely feel that Chevrolet has no obligation to do anything other than replace the engine.  However, this does theoretically hurt the long term value of the car.  Is there any legal recovery for this loss?Irrelavent, to the question, this guy said he is done with Chevy and will sell the car when its repaired.  He will likely make more than he paid for it as well, as these vehicles are heavily in demand.  So that is a positive for him.","answer":"Barring manufacturer negligence (and even this is a dubious theory, given that recovery would be for ), there is probably no legal theory that would allow recovery of any loss of resale value.I am assuming that the promise to replace\/repair the engine if it fails is part of the contract of sale. .Assuming the manufacturer fulfils what it agreed to in the warranty, then the buyer is getting exactly what they contracted for and there is no contractual theory that would support any further recovery: there is no breach.The buyer bought a car that included a warranty to repair. I cannot imagine that they bought a car that included a promise that it would not fail."}

Also, the act several times uses  &quot;hostilities&quot; in connection with the term &quot;combat&quot;, and once to describe the actions of a &quot;terrorist group&quot;.It would seem then that &quot;armed combat or terrorism&quot;  would be a good definition for  &quot;hostilities&quot; in this act."}

{"question":"This question was inspired by , regarding a data breach in a UK-based company.In short, the data of a UK-based company was leaked by an US-based contractor. Since the UK is still part of the European Union, it is therefore still affected by the GDPR, and may be legally responsible to report a data breach.One person commented, that said company would only be affected by the GDPR, until the UK would leave the European Union.Inspired by this, I would like to present a hypothetical situation, in which a UK-based company had a data breach while still affected by the GDPR, but chose not to report it, because that situation would change soon.However, the relevant offices were informed of the alleged breach, and began conducting an investigation. During this investigation, the UK leaves the EU in a way that EU laws and regulations would not apply to the UK anymore.If that investigation were later come to the conclusion that the company would have been required to report the breach, would the EU have the right to fine the offending company?","answer":"This is an interesting question. The general rule in common-law systems is that the law at the time of the alleged offense applies, unless the law that makes a change explicitly provides otherwise. So this might depend on the exact terms of the parliamentary action by which the UK withdraws from the EU.However, it is worth noting that the GDPR applies, or at least purports to apply, to non-EU entities which are processing data of people who are in the EU. The hypothetical UK company would still come under that provision, although it is unclear, at least to me, how this would be enforced.By the way, my understanding is that in EU member states fines are imposed by national authorities, so if any fines were to be imposed under the GDPR in this hypothetical case, they might well be imposed by the UK, not the EU."}
{"question":"Is it illegal to lock the wheel of a car and demand money for unlocking it because the car was parked in an area of reserved use by the person placing the lock in the car?","answer":"ProbablyAs stated in .By parking on someone else's land you have committed the tort of trespass and the owner would be entitled to damages up until the time they put the lock on the car; after that, they have removed your power to end the trespass.

{"question":"I have a YouTube video which uses a song that I found on .  The website gives me permission to use the song under the CC 3.0 Attribution license.  Appropriate credit is given in the video description.  I have not had any direct contact with the artist.  I live in the US.A company presumably representing the artist has filed a claim on my video and ignored the proof of license that I provided (a link to the song on the website and a link to the license itself).I don't expect it will come to this, but I found myself wondering - if they were to come after me through legal channels, would it be my responsibility to prove that my license is valid or would it be their responsibility to prove that it is invalid?  Would a license obtained in this manner hold up in court?","answer":"The first thing that has to be done (in court, or via lawyer-to-lawyer communication) is that The Company has to prove that they own the copyright. If they accomplish that, you can defend yourself by providing proof of a license to download and redistribute. From what I can tell, you cannot directly prove that, since the rights-holder did not give you the license. The issue is that a third party cannot impose a license on a work simply by putting it out there with a file that claims to be a license from the artist. So this brings in the Free Music Archive: they presumably have some evidence that the rights holder did indeed grant the alleged license, and may be able to provide proof. Your argument may be credible, in the sense that you had a good-faith belief that the item was so licensed, and the website would provide a basis for concluding that that belief is reasonable.If the work was licensed, then the some rights holder would know that, but not necessarily the current one. Assume the artist made a recording, transferred the rights to Company A, who later sold the rights to Company B who is now coming after you. Artist may have licensed it when it was his, and forgot to tell A. A may have licensed it when they sold the license to B. Artist may have improperly licensed it after he sold the work to A (under the 'I wrote it, I have the right to do whatever I want' non-legal theory). A might have improperly licensed the work after selling the right to B (maybe by mistakenly including it in a package deal, i.e. via bookkeeping error, rather than ignorance of the law). Or, they may simply have forgotten.If this is a DMCA takedown notice, the notice-giver could just be abusing the system.

{"question":"I'm wondering what the real meaning of moral turpitude is in regards to border crossing (canadian traveling to USA)... mainly interested in finding out of house arrest short sentences for assault causing bodily harm are considered moral turpitude. And also are arrest charges themselves included in that? Someone could get arrested for the worst crime involving moral turpitude, but then get convicted of a minor charge as the arrest was a mistake.I have heard that even if you are arrested for something, this is still considered at the border, as who is going to allow someone to cross the border who has been arrested for terrorism related crimes 4 times, but never convicted?

So this would be beyond the allowed 12 month limit defined by the exception rules regarding moral turpitude. Assault causing bodily harm via indictment is max 10 years sentence, against over the limit of what moral turpitude i.e. theoretically, any assault causing bodily harm, is in fact a moral turpitude issue. Simple assault that is not defined as bodily harm in a conviction, is not considered moral turpitude issue.

{"question":"Could an undercover police officer sign a contract as part of an investigation (for example, to gain access to a location)?If they signed it using their real name, would the contract be binding on them? If they signed it with a fake name, would that be perjury?","answer":"A contract (assuming that the contract itself was for a legal object, rather than, for example, a contract to pay $100,000 for X kilograms of cocaine), is binding whether or not it is signed in the officer's real name.Generally speaking, someone who signs a contract when secretly working as an agent for some organization in manner not disclosed to the other party to the contract has personal liability for a breach of that contract, even if the undisclosed principal (the government that employs the undercover agent) has a secret duty to reimburse the agent for this expense.Perjury pertains only to statements made under penalty of perjury or under oath, which a contract would almost never do. And, if the intent of the undercover agent at the time the contract was signed was not to stiff the other party to the contract and not pay, it would also not constitute either criminal fraud or civil fraud.Instead, it would be more analogous to a sole proprietor who does not have a legal business entity, doing business under a trade name, or an actor or author doing business under an alias."}

The hospital is asking me to pay 50,000 USD.Does anyone know a NEW rule? If so, please the link.What shall I do to get the birth certificate?","answer":"Someone is yanking your chain. The law regarding birth certificates , says that  (a) In accordance with Code Section  and the regulations  adopted pursuant thereto: (1) The state registrar or local custodian,  upon receipt of a written application, shall issue: (A) A certified  copy of a vital record in that registrar's or custodian's custody or  abstract thereof to any applicant having a direct and tangible  interest in the vital record(a parent has an obvious direct and tangible interest in their child's birth certificate).

{"question":"I am researching the COVID 2020 lockdowns in Los Angeles, where mayor turned off the electricity, for people who have parties and social gatherings.

The mayor's notice-only service interruption is, therefore, a gross abuse of power.I've included the conclusion even though I don't think it's necessarily correct - it depends what's in the notice whether due process has been afforded. If the notice is a show cause notice which gives an opportunity to be heard before a neutral decision maker (not necessarily a judicial officer), then that's due process.From what I can , the notice was delivered on or about 6 August 2020 and power was disconnected on 20 August - that's plenty of time for submissions to be made and considered by the decision maker. It's also plenty of time for an injunction to be sought if the person did not believe they were being afforded due process.Now, is possible, even probable, that given what the occupants do for a living, they were quite happy to have their utilities shut off. All publicity is good publicity after all. They may therefore have chosen not to respond to the notice.This is a situation where everyone is happy with the status quo - the influencers can play up their victim status and make lots of money, the mayor gets to be tough which no doubt plays well with his constituents.

{"question":"If I understand correctly, any debt in the US can be paid in paper US dollars. If the denomination of the debt is Bitcoin, gallons of gasoline, ounces of gold, pallets of smartphones, or anything else, it can be paid with the fair market value of the items in paper money. How does this work if the debt has no clear monetary value? If I create a cryptocurrency (ABCcoin) and my friend creates another (XYZcoin), I mine some ABC and he mines some XYZ, and we sign a contract to trade 50 ABC for 100 XYZ, that is the only transaction involving the currencies, so it sets the market value at 1 XYZ = 2 ABC. However, neither currency has a value in US dollars. What if I decide I want to keep my ABCcoin and pay my friend in US dollars instead? How would the value of ABCcoin in dollars be determined with no market to determine a market value?","answer":"The court decidesFirst off, this isn't a debt, it's a breach of contract that may lead to a debt once a court rules on it.You broke your contract to provide 50 ABC (or a car, or 10 heads of lettuce, doesn't matter). This gives the plaintiff the right to sue to be put in the same position as they would have been in if you hadn't broken the promise.The court might order specific performance, that is, they will make an order that you transfer the 50 ABC.More likely, the court will order the payment of damages. The onus is on the plaintiff to prove what damage they suffered by not having 50 ABC. For example, they might produce evidence that they had a buyer who was willing to pay them $10,000 for 50 ABC, if so, the damages are $10,000. If they can't prove that 50 ABC has any value, then they get nominal damages - $1.Courts have a very strong preference for damages rather than specific performance. Specific performance is usually only ordered when damages cannot restore the innocent party, typically where the item is unique - a piece of art, a vintage car, a piece of land etc. and money is not a substitute.Courts prefer the  theory of contract rather than the more moralistic contract as promise. That is, a contract is an economic commitment rather than an ethical one - if it serves a party's interest to break the contract and pay damages, they should be allowed to do so."}
{"question":"The Constitution states that the federal government has the right to regulate commerce between the states. As shown in Gibbons v. Ogden; Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.

Washington State Apple Advertising Comm., 432 U.S.  333 (1977) which can only be overcome by a showing that the State has  no other means to advance a legitimate local purpose, Maine v.  Taylor, 477 U.S. 131(1986). See also Brown-Forman Distillers v. New  York State Liquor Authority, 476 U.S. 573 (1986).Notwithstanding these constitutional protections against discrimination based upon state residence, the U.S. Supreme Court held that this discrimination is constitutional in the case Vlandis v. Kline, , 526 U.S. 489 (1999). The majority opinion in Vlandis v. Kline explains this authority was basically undisputed at that time:  The appellees do not challenge, nor did the District Court invalidate,  the option of the State to classify students as resident and  nonresident students, thereby obligating nonresident students to pay  higher tuition and fees than do bona fide residents. The State's right  to make such a classification is unquestioned here.Some of the justification is set forth in the Saenz v. Roe (1999) decision which states:  The second component of the right to travel is, however, expressly  protected by the text of the Constitution. The first sentence of  Article IV, 2, provides: 'The Citizens of each State shall be  entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several  States.' Thus, by virtue of a person's state citizenship, a citizen of  one State who travels in other States, intending to return home at the  end of his journey, is entitled to enjoy the 'Privileges and  Immunities of Citizens in the several States' that he visits.  This  provision removes 'from the citizens of each State the disabilities of  alienage in the other States.'  It provides important protections for  nonresidents who enter a State whether to obtain employment,  to  procure medical services, or even to engage in commercial shrimp  fishing, Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U.S. 385 (1948). Those protections are  not 'absolute,' but the Clause 'does bar discrimination against  citizens of other States where there is no substantial reason for the  discrimination beyond the mere fact that they are citizens of other  States.'  There may be a substantial reason for requiring the  nonresident to pay more than the resident for a hunting license, see  Baldwin v. Fish and Game Comm'n of Mont., 436 U.S. 371 (1978), or to  enroll in the state university, see Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U.S. 441  (1973), but our cases have not identified any acceptable reason for  qualifying the protection afforded by the Clause for 'the 'citizen of  State A who ventures into State B' to settle there and establish a  home.' Zobel, 457 U.S. at 74 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment).  Permissible justifications for discrimination between residents and  nonresidents are simply inapplicable to a nonresident's exercise of  the right to move into another State and become a resident of that  State.    Despite fundamentally differing views concerning the coverage of the  Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, most  notably expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions in the  Slaughter-House Cases (1873), it has always been common ground that  this Clause protects the third component of the right to travel.  Writing for the majority in the Slaughter-House Cases, Justice Miller  explained that one of the privileges conferred by this Clause 'is that  a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition, become a  citizen of any State of the Union by a bona fide residence therein,  with the same rights as other citizens of that State.'Basically, the exception isn't logical and instead is a case of the Courts upholding a common practice that seems to make economic sense, notwithstanding that fact that it is clearly contrary to the relevant constitutional provisions and doctrines. The life of the law is not reason, it is experience. Assuming logical consistency in the law will often lead you to a descriptively inaccurate result."}

I have since recovered, and just so happened to check my court records in which I discovered that I had a bench warrant.  I was apparently written up for not having insurance in this accident but was not notified in any way of this.  I did have insurance at this time and they paid me out for the accident.  What are my options in this case, and if I hire an attorney, would I be reimbursed for this?This is in the United States and specific to the state of Hawaii.","answer":"  What are my options in this case, and if I hire an attorney, would I  be reimbursed for this?You should hire an attorney to negotiate a dismissal of the charges based upon the fact that you did have insurance.If you had known about the charge and showed up in court on the appointed hearing date, you probably could have negotiated a resolution of this without a lawyer. But, even though your failure to appear was not your fault, at this point it is imprudent to try to do it yourself. There is too much of a risk that you will end up in jail for an extended period of time while the case is resolved if you do that.You will not be reimbursed for your attorneys' fees. Once you are charged with a crime, your criminal defense expenses are your problem, economically, unless you are indigent, in which case, after you are arrested and arraigned you would have a public defender appointed for you. But, you don't want to be arrested and detained so that you can get a public defender if there is any possible way to avoid that outcome.Insurance will normally not cover any form of criminal defense representation, even if you are in the clear, although AAA sometimes will post a small bond for you for certain traffic offenses if you are a AAA member."}
{"question":"Can I (sole-owner and sole-employee) simply take whatever profits I make from my LLC's bank account and pay them to myself,  rather than paying myself a defined salary or rate? (I'm not saying this is good business advice, and I'd keep money for taxes, but I'm wondering if I can do this.)And does this change based on whether I file as a single-member LLC, or file as an LLC but elect to be treated as a corporation?Also, does this change when I hire employees?  (not founders, or partners, just employees).State: Wisconsin","answer":"In the UK, it's quite simple: The money that the company makes after paying for goods, salaries etc. is profit. The company pays tax on the profit. The profits after taxes are owned by the company. Even if you own 100% of the company, you can't just take the money. Instead, the owners of the company can discuss between themselves whether they want to use their profits to pay dividends to the company owners. This may be a very onesided discussion if you are the only owner :-) Then the money gets paid out as a dividend, and everyone receiving a dividend has to pay taxes on it. The tax office will be unhappy if they find out that you paid out dividends to people who don't seem to deserve any dividends (typically if dividends are paid to a wife who has no other income and therefore pays no taxes, while not contributing anything to the company). If the tax office is unhappy, they try hard to make you unhappy and usually succeed. The tax office will also be unhappy if you 'just take money from the bank account'. The company can give you a loan - in which case that needs to be written down, and the loan must be repaid. If you have no intent to pay back the loan, that could be fraud. And for dividend payments, that needs to be written down as well. Even if you are the only one making the decision to pay a dividend, that must be agreed upon and recorded. BTW. If you pay so much in dividends that you can't pay your taxes or your bills afterwards, that is strictly illegal and you may even go to jail for doing it. BTW. If you have employees then you pay their salaries and are responsible for sending their taxes to the tax office; these payments will reduce your profits, so this is not really relevant to your question. But if you took so much in dividends that you cannot pay your employees, that would be legal trouble for you. I would expect other countries to have similar rules. (Not sure if the question has changed or I missed it, but you are free to pay yourself a different salary every month (and pay income tax on it), depending on how well your business was doing in that month, and end up with zero profit. That's in the UK not the most tax-effective way to do it; paying yourself a dividend is financially better). "}
{"question":"Section 21 of the Washington State Constitution states:The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate, but the legislature may provide for a jury of any number less than twelve in courts not of record, and for a verdict by nine or more jurors in civil cases in any court of record, and for waiving of the jury in civil cases where the consent of the parties interested is given thereto.RCW 4.48.010 goes on to state in part:The court shall order all or any of the issues in a civil action, whether of fact or law, or both, referred to a referee upon the written consent of the parties which is filed with the clerk. Any party shall have the right in an action at law, upon an issue of fact, to demand a trial by jury. No referee appointed under this chapter may preside over a jury trial. The written consent of the parties constitutes a waiver of the right of trial by jury by any party having the right.However, RCW 3.50.135 imposes a restriction where it states in part:In all civil cases, the plaintiff or defendant may demand a jury, which shall consist of six citizens of the state who shall be impaneled and sworn as in cases before district courts, or the trial may be by a judge of the municipal court: PROVIDED, That no jury trial may be held on a proceeding involving a traffic infraction.Similarly, RCW 35.20.090 states:In all civil cases and criminal cases where jurisdiction is concurrent with district courts as provided in RCW 35.20.250, within the jurisdiction of the municipal court, the plaintiff or defendant may demand a jury, which shall consist of six citizens of the state who shall be impaneled and sworn as in cases before district courts, or the trial may be by a judge of the municipal court: PROVIDED, That no jury trial may be held on a proceeding involving a traffic infraction.Question: Does the wording of 3.50.135 and 35.20.090 impose a limit on the individual's right to demand a trial by jury, or is it instead a restriction on the ability of traffic courts to conduct a jury trial?  The wording would seem to indicate the latter because individuals do not hold trials or proceedings, but courts do.And if my interpretation is correct, what would be an appropriate response or course of action on the part of the traffic court if the defendant in a traffic case insisted on their right to a trial by jury?","answer":"It precludes a trial by jury in an alternative municipal court for a traffic infraction. The right to a jury trial is preserved in district court.   says thatThe municipal court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction overtraffic infractions arising under city ordinances and exclusiveoriginal criminal jurisdiction of all violations of city ordinancesduly adopted by the city and shall have original jurisdiction of allother actions brought to enforce or recover license penalties orforfeitures declared or given by such ordinances or by state statuteswhich precludes taking the matter to district court in order to get a jury trial.

{"question":"Is it legal to ship an envelope of glitter to somebody (e.g. )?If it's not, what are the potential penalties?","answer":"This may constitutes harassment, which is against the law in most jurisdictions. But what counts as legal harassment is not obvious. Taking Washington state as an exemplar, , the stated intent of the law is to criminalize 'repeated invasions of a person's privacy by acts and threats which show a pattern of harassment designed to coerce, intimidate, or humiliate the victim', and mailing glitter in order to annoy a person would not match that desideratum. In Washington, the law is limited to threats of physical harm or restraint or the intent to 'substantially harm the person threatened or another with respect to his or her physical or mental health or safety'. There is no legal standard for judging what constitutes substantial harm to mental health. in its civil code as  unlawful violence, a credible threat of violence, or a knowing and  willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that  seriously alarms, annoys, or harasses the person, and that serves no legitimate purpose. The course of conduct must be such as would  cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress,  and must actually cause substantial emotional distress to the  petitioner.More words, but still it is left to the jury to decide whether an act causes severe emotional distress.

{"question":" tokens in exchanges.  The rules are not yet law, but nothing is expected to derail the legislation.Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are organizations constructed by rules encoded as a computer program running on a blockchain replicated all over the world.  They are sometimes registered in some form, for example on July 1, 2021, Wyoming became the first US state to recognize DAOs as a legal entity.  However the vast majority are not, and  have uncertain legal standing, and may functionally be a corporation without legal status as a corporation: a general partnership. They are controlled by owners of tokens voting on resolutions, and the results of the votes are implemented without further human intervention.  The human interface with the token holders is via wallets, they are a crucial element of the technology. the owners are jointly and severally liable for any legal actions and debts the company may face.Does this mean that anyone who holds DAO tokens could be prosecuted and face legal sanction?","answer":"Could everyone with DAO tokens in the EU be punished under recent Transfer of Funds Regulations on KYC?It depends on the enactment or final draft. According to this , the answer is no.Even if a blockchain and stakeholders were considered a DAO, recital 18b implies that neither ownership nor certain methods of trade trigger any obligations pursuant to this regulation. Recital 18b exempts from the scope of this regulation &quot;person-to-person transfers of crypto-assets without the use or involvement of a provider of crypto-assets or other obliged entity, or when both the originator and beneficiary are providers of crypto-asset transfers acting on their own behalf&quot;. Recital 18a and others further constrain the scope of the regulation.Ownership is unaffected. As for transfers, the parties to a person-to-person transaction need to ensure that their method of transfer does not trigger the scope of the regulation. For instance, the last paragraph of article 2.3 provides that electronic forms of payment such as &quot;a payment card, an electronic money instrument or a mobile phone, or any other digital or IT prepaid or postpaid device with similar characteristics&quot; trigger the application of the regulation even for person-to-person transfers.Article 2.3 showcases the parliamentary sloppiness I pointed out in , and it largely renders the person-to-person exemption meaningless. The drafters' act of listing &quot;a mobile phone&quot; right in the middle of payment instruments and pre-\/postpaid devices, culminating with the phrase &quot;with similar characteristics&quot;, creates confusion.

Since only commercial use is prohibited, does this mean noncommercial use is permitted? Otherwise, according to , embeds do not infringe copyright? Is that right?Thank you.","answer":"The answer depends on some missing facts. The first is, who do you get the footage from. For the sake of discussion, I will assume this is from C-Span. This matters because under US copyright law, works of the US government are not protected by copyright, but that does not mean that works about the US government are unprotected. C-Span is not a government employee, therefore C-Span is entitled to copyright protection. The  suggests a complex of considerations related to the need for a license.The House of Representatives can establish its own rules which could prohibit making a recording of sessions with the intent to make political comments on the content, but those rules can only pertain to conduct in the House chambers. The house cannot unilaterally pass a law, that requires cooperation of the Senate and the president, or massive cooperation of the two houses, and such a law that prohibits political commentary on House conduct would not long survive judicial review. The C-span FAQoid does not suggest that there is any restriction on political usage of their footage, so perhaps the footage comes from somewhere else.The main point is that you would have to dig deep to see who is distributing the footage, and under what authority they impose restrictions on redistribution. Ordinary copyright could be the source, though it is also an open question whether automatically recorded video has the scintilla of creativity required to make a work protectable.Another possible source is the , which unlike C-Span is full of government employees creating government works (which are unprotected). They do say that there is a form that has to be signed avowing that you will not use the work for political or commercial purposes. In order to find out what their requirements are, you have to call or mail an exact order, which will be forwarded to another office, and you will get the required form. Again, though, it is an open legal question whether a branch of the US government can prohibit making political comments about congressional sessions. It is a little less controversial that Congress can regulate interstate commerce.If a person actually holds copyright in a work, the question of commercial \/ non-commercial and fair use does not come down to a simple commercial \/ non-commercial dichotomy. Furthermore, &quot;non-commercial&quot; is not the same as &quot;free&quot;. Two opposites on the &quot;nature of the work&quot; continuum are &quot;educational&quot; vs. &quot;commercial&quot;, but vast numbers of educational works cost money. If you were to freely distribute the entirety of a recent commercial movie, that would be a &quot;non-commercial&quot; use, but also highly infringing.

{"question":"I know in general that  effectively means that once a court rules on a law that other courts can use that decision when considering their cases.  But why is that the case, how is it applied, and why are court reluctant to go against the precedence set in another case?","answer":"Stare decisis is more than just the authority for later decisions to refer to previous ones; it is, to a certain degree, an obligation to. Which is to say, that as a rule, judges (and more often than not their clerks) will spend a lot of their time looking through old cases in order to find out what case law has decided, what the precedent is. At this point, they'll be unlikely to change it, unless circumstances have changed, or there's been a tremendous change of opinion on the court (like with the reversal in Brown v. Board of Education).As mentioned in Auto Equity Sales v. Superior Court before the California Supreme Court and as brought in the Wikipedia article on precedent: 'under the doctrine of stare decisis, all tribunals exercising inferior jurisdiction are required to follow decisions of courts exercising superior jurisdiction.'I'm not totally sure what you mean by how it's applied, but as to the reasoning: judges like having rules. We want the law to be clear and established, so that people can look through it and find out what the law is for them. If courts were constantly reversing earlier decisions, there'd be no legal stability, and it'd be far too hard for anyone to know what is and isn't the law.This would also to a certain degree detract from the legitimacy of criminal punishment, since if the accused couldn't know it was a crime, why should we punish him?Both of these two parts of reasoning can be found in Antonin Scalia's article on  (that link only contains excerpts; I wasn't able to find a publicly accessible full version of the article)."}

All remedies for such a breach shall be cumulative and the pursuit of one remedy shall not be deemed to exclude any other remedy with respect to the subject matter hereof.","answer":"No, a bond is a guarantee of performance of one party to a judgement. It's effectively meaningless in this context because it's a very low value. If you lost the case when they sued you, this is a guarantee that you have to pay, and isn't returned until the judgement is paid in full.They can't take your shares, at least not as part of this clause, but they may be able to get a significant judgement against you, forcing you to sell them. I would be very careful here, this clause alone basically makes you unlimited-ly liable for a lot of money."}
{"question":"According to a New York Times story  a woman in the Borough of Roselle Park, N.J has been ordered to take down a political banner because of its \"obscene\" content under a local law, or face daily fines. While the story does not directly quote the banner, it seems that it says \"Fuck Biden\" or something close to that.The Mayor of the town was quoted as saying:This is not about politics in any way, ... It's about decency.The mayor is also reported as saying that the same steps would have been taken if the banner had supported Biden and opposed Trump in similar language.According to :Roselle Park Municipal Court Judge Gary Bundy ordered the Willow Avenue homeowner to remove the signs with profanity within a week or face a $250-a-day fine. Patricia Dilascio is the property owner but her daughter, Andrea Dick, had the signs, three of which include the F-word, on display.The Judge was quoted in that story as saying:This is not a case about politics. It is a case, pure and simple, about language[.] This ordinance does not restrict political speech. Neither this town or its laws may abridge or eliminate Ms. Dilascio's freedom of speech. However, freedom of speech is not simply an absolute right. It is clear from state law and statutes that we cannot simply put up the umbrella of the First Amendment and say everything and anything is protected speech.The action was brought under  which provides that:\u00a7 3-8.1 Obscene Materials or Actions Prohibited.[1980 Code 152-1]It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, business association, club, group of individuals or any combination of the aforementioned to knowingly photograph, act in, pose for, print, sell, offer for sale, give away, exhibit, publish or offer to publish or otherwise distribute or pander, make, display or exhibit any obscene material, communication or performance or other article or item which is obscene within the Borough.\u00a7 3-8.2 Determination of Obscenity.[1980 Code 152-2]The word \"obscene\" shall mean any material, communication or performance which the average person applying contemporary community standards existing within the municipality, would find, when considered as a whole:a. Appeals to the prurient interest;b. Depicts or describes in a patently offensive way sexual conduct as hereinafter specifically defined, or depicts or exhibits offensive nakedness as hereinafter specifically defined; andc. Lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.Can a local court in the US validly make such an order, given the protections of the US First Amendment?","answer":"In the Vietnam War era case of <a href='https:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/supremecourt\/text\/403\/15' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>Cohen v. California 403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct. 1780,29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971)<\/a> the US Supreme court held that the use of the word &quot;fuck&quot; in political speech was protected. As the opinion says:Appellant Paul Robert Cohen was convicted in the Los Angeles Municipal Court of violating that part of California Penal Code 415 which prohibits 'maliciously and willfully disturb(ing) the peace or quiet of any neighborhood or person' ...On April 26, 1968, the defendant was observed in the Los Angeles County Courthouse in the corridor outside of division 20 of the municipal court wearing a jacket bearing the words 'Fuck the Draft' which were plainly visible. There were women and children present in the corridor. The defendant was arrested. The defendant testified that he wore the jacket knowing that the words were on the jacket as a means of informing the public of the depth of his feelings against the Vietnam War and the draft.In affirming the conviction the Court of Appeal held that 'offensive conduct' means 'behavior which has a tendency to provoke others to acts of violence or to in turn disturb the peace,' and that the State had proved this element because, on the facts of this case, '(i)t was certainly reasonably foreseeable that such conduct might cause others to rise up to commit a violent act against the person of the defendant or attempt to forceably remove his jacket.'...The conviction quite clearly rests upon the asserted offensiveness of the words Cohen used to convey his message to the public. The only 'conduct' which the State sought to punish is the fact of communication. Thus, we deal here with a conviction resting solely upon 'speech,' cf. Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed. 1117 (1931), not upon any separately identifiable conduct which allegedly was intended by Cohen to be perceived by others as expressive of particular views ......Appellant's conviction, then, rests squarely upon his exercise of the 'freedom of speech' protected from arbitrary governmental interference by the Constitution and can be justified, if at all, only as a valid regulation of the manner in which he exercised that freedom, not as a permissible prohibition on the substantive message it conveys. This does not end the inquiry, of course, for the First and Fourteenth Amendments have never been thought to give absolute protection to every individual to speak whenever or wherever he pleases or to use any form of address in any circumstances that he chooses. ......... this case cannot be said to fall within those relatively few categories of instances where prior decisions have established the power of government to deal more comprehensively with certain forms of individual expression simply upon a showing that such a form was employed. This is not, for example, an obscenity case. Whatever else may be necessary to give rise to the States' broader power to prohibit obscene expression, such expression must be, in some significant way, erotic. Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957). ...... While the four-letter word displayed by Cohen in relation to the draft is not uncommonly employed in a personally provocative fashion, in this instance it was clearly not 'directed to the person of the hearer.' Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 309, 60 S.Ct. 900, 906, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940). No individual actually or likely to be present could reasonably have regarded the words on appellant's jacket as a direct personal insult. Nor do we have here an instance of the exercise of the State's police power to prevent a speaker from intentionally provoking a given group to hostile reaction. Cf. Feiner v. New York, 340 U.S. 315, 71 S.Ct. 303, 95 L.Ed. 295 (1951); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949). ...... Of course, the mere presumed presence of unwitting listeners or viewers does not serve automatically to justify curtailing all speech capable of giving offense. See, e.g., Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U.S. 415, 91 S.Ct. 1575, 29 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971). ..... the issue flushed by this case stands out in bold relief. It is whether California can excise, as 'offensive conduct,' one particular scurrilous epithet from the public discourse, either upon the theory of the court below that its use is inherently likely to cause violent reaction or upon a more general assertion that the States, acting as guardians of public morality, may properly remove this offensive word from the public vocabulary.The rationale of the California court is plainly untenable. At most it reflects an 'undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance (which) is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression.' Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 508, 89 S.Ct. 733, 737, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). We have been shown no evidence that substantial numbers of citizens are standing ready to strike out physically at whoever may assault their sensibilities with execrations like that uttered by Cohen.  ...... we cannot overemphasize that, in our judgment, most situations where the State has a justifiable interest in regulating speech will fall within one or more of the various established exceptions, discussed above but not applicable here, to the usual rule that governmental bodies may not prescribe the form or content of individual expression....... we discern certain more particularized considerations that peculiarly call for reversal of this conviction. First, the principle contended for by the State seems inherently boundless. How is one to distinguish this from any other offensive word? ...... we cannot overlook the fact, ... that much linguistic expression serves a dual communicative function: it conveys not only ideas capable of relatively precise, detached explication, but otherwise inexpressible emotions as well. In fact, words are often chosen as much for their emotive as their cognitive force. ...... we cannot indulge the facile assumption that one can forbid particular words without also running a substantial risk of suppressing ideas in the process. Indeed, governments might soon seize upon the censorship of particular words as a convenient guise for banning the expression of unpopular views.It is, in sum, our judgment that, absent a more particularized and compelling reason for its actions, the State may not, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, make the simple public display here involved of this single four-letter expletive a criminal offense. Because that is the only arguably sustainable rationale for the conviction here at issue, the judgment below must be reversed.Thus the Court held that, when used in a political rather than an erotic context, the word &quot;fuck&quot; was protected free speech, not subject to government prohibition, at least under the circumstances of the Cohen case. As the use of this word is farm more publicly acceptable now than it was in 1968 or 1971, It is hard to see how this ruling would change. I would expect a court to overturn the judgement against the woman who posted the banners.<h2 id='further-information-ymr2'>Further InformationIn the  it is said that:The Court ultimately found that displaying a mere four-letter word was not sufficient justification to allow states to restrict free speech and that free speech can be restricted only under severe circumstances beyond offensiveness. The ruling set a precedent used in future cases concerning the power of states to regulate free speech in order to maintain public civility.Other important cases cited in the Cohen opmion include: in which a man attempting to promote his religious views played a phonograph record to others on a public street. The others found the record offensive, and Cantwell was convicted of a breech of the peace and of soliciting without a license. Te US Supreme Court overturned the conviction in what has become a landmark case. was a case in which a high-school student was part of a group who decided to wear black armbands to school in protest of the Vietnam War and were suspended from school.It should be noted that the terms of the Borough ordinance closely track the , the current Supreme Court case defining obscenity. However that decision requires that to be &quot;obscene&quot; a text or image must be in significant degree sexual  -- this is what is meant by &quot;appeals to the prurient interest&quot;.  3-8.2 (a) of the code (quoted in the question) requires that to be found obscene content must &quot;appeal to the prurient interest&quot;, but it is hard to see how the political signs described in the news stories (and pictured in one of them) so appeal."}

{"question":"Suppose MS Excel has an API so that other programs can communicate with it. Suppose I'm the developer of OpenOffice Calc, and I want other programs to be able to communicate with my program in like manner. So, for example, let's say Excel's API has a function called 'run' and takes a formula as an argument. Calc's API would then also have a function called 'run', which takes a function as an argument. Is that legal?","answer":"My opinion is that the copying of a single API endpoint, 'run' that takes a function as an argument is not infringement.I can think of several lines of argument that get to this same conclusion:Originality: It doesn't exhibit the modicum of creativity required by the originality test. ()Short phrases doctrine: It is a short word or phrase, which both the copyright office () have declared ineligible for copyright.Merger: The merger doctrine allows reuse of an expression if it is one of only a very few number of ways of expressing an idea. I can't think of many other ways to express a function intended to run a function other than with the verb 'run'.Sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire: It is not infringement to use an expression if it has become standard, stock, or common in a particular setting. Naming a function 'run' is common in the programming community.Any one of these alone would be enough to rule out copyright infringement by taking this individual component of Excel's API.Note: Whether merger and sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire are part of the originality\/copyrightability analysis or part of the infringement analysis is not uniform across circuits. For example, the 6th circuit considers both merger and sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire part of the copyrightability analysis. But, the 2nd and 9th circuits treat them as part of the infringement analysis and in the 9th circuit, they are affirmative defenses."}
{"question":"In ' technique to establish that they possessed the work before it was published, in case they ever want to assert their copyright. This could consist of an unopened letter with a date stamp, a notarized copy, or some other scheme involving a third party. According to the wikipedia entry there is no specific provision for this in US copyright law.Is there any legal reason to use a 'poor man's copyright'? Have these techniques been used successfully in court, or are they mostly useless? And if one wanted to use such a technique, what is the best way to go about it?I am looking for an answer for US law, but would appreciate other countries' perspectives too.","answer":"The :  There is no provision in the copyright law regarding any such type of protection, and it is not a substitute for registration.This means that the U.S. government will not grant you any special rights or protections for having undertaken poor man's copyright, unlike advance copyright registration, which confers the ability to collect statutory damages. In any case, as a prerequisite to legal action, you will need to register your work, even if you must do so after the infringement has taken place:  You will have to register, however, if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work.Instead, poor man's copyright is purely an evidentiary mechanism for proving possession of a work at a particular point in time. Suppose a best-selling author illegally uses huge verbatim passages of your unpublished work in a new novel. As part of your legal argument against the infringing author, you want to prove that you possessed your unpublished work decades before the author claimed to have started work on the infringing novel.The truly serious issue with many types of poor man's copyright is that it simply doesn't prove what it intends to prove. If you have a sealed envelope that is postmarked with a date, that only proves that the envelope passed through the postal system on that day. It says nothing about what the contents of the envelope were at the time; notably, the envelope could be mailed unsealed and then filled and sealed at a later date.More involved forms of poor man's copyright, like storing a work in an undisturbed bank safe deposit box, might carry more evidentiary weight, but such an approach could still be difficult to verify reliably: we must ask the bank to verify the negative that no one ever accessed the deposit box. This may or may not be something the bank is prepared to do, and they may or may not maintain such records perpetually.If you really want to prove that you had possession of a creative work on a particular day (which, again, is not a complete legal argument, but may be helpful), you will need to find a trustworthy third party who can demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that the work has remained undisturbed in their possession since a particular date. A bank might be good at this, but the best agency I know of to carry out such a purpose is the U.S. Copyright Office! They allow you to register your work (for probably much cheaper than a decades-long deposit box rental) and confer the benefits of registration, e.g. statutory damages.I don't know of any legal cases that have tested a poor man's copyright in court. On a personal note, I suspect there are none, because the primary case that poor man's copyright is intended to protect against -- someone taking your unpublished work and making the baldfaced lie that it is their own, such that your only recourse is to prove a timeline that renders their claims impossible -- seems somewhat uncommon. Consider the likelihood of such a case occurring combined with the likelihood of a plaintiff who has undertaken poor man's copyright, and I suspect the likelihood is small indeed."}

{"question":"My understanding is that senior government officials usually exercise powers by recording their decision to do so, such as by sending an email or signing a piece of paper. For example, the US President might sign a printed copy of an Act or a proposed executive order. That Act or order would usually be subsequently published, and in some cases the law requires the decision to be publicised in a particular way after it is made (e.g. published in the Federal Register). However I am not sure if there are any legal restrictions on the procedure used to initially record the actual making of the decision.On 23 August 2019, the US President  that 'American companies are hereby ordered' to do something, and retweeted the tweet on the official 'POTUS' Twitter account. It's not clear to me whether this tweet was intended to constitute a formal order or was referring to a separate document which would contain the formal order. In any case, this made me wonder (as a general proposition) whether it would be possible to dispense with any other more formal document, and just issue the order via Twitter.

Thornhill is trying to get a statement made by Drucker in. However, the opponent party is the state, and the state did not make the statement. The manager of the store made the statement.

{"question":"I received an email from my bank a couple days ago that really has me floored, and I question how it can be legal. The email itself was a short blurb similar to the 'We've updated our terms of service' emails, with a link to a document describing what was actually going on. The document itself is an 'Arbitration and Waiver of class action.' The effective date is defined as 'the 61st day after we provide ... [this notice] to you.' You have the option to opt out, in writing to a P.O. box. If you don't jump through these hoops 'you will be deemed to have consented to [arbitration].' There is also a clause that it is retroactively enforceable if the claims 'relate to conduct that happened [before this notice].'It seems ludicrous to me that the process isRead bland email and click link to access actual information (action required)Read document that goes into effect at undefined dateWrite a letter with intent to opt-out (action required). No mention of what information to include, and I hope you have envelopes and stamps at the ready otherwise there's another hoop to jump through.This feels to me like getting people to agree to contracts they've never seen. Can the bank do this? Are companies allowed to create contracts with anything they want in them, and apply them to you because you didn't read an email and subsequently jump through 5 hoops? Is this practice legally enforceable? How does this differ from me dropping off a letter in all my neighbors mailboxes stating that if they don't come to my place with an engraved card stating intent to opt-out, they're agreeing to send me $100 per month for eternity? What do you mean, they had the chance to opt-out!The actual notice .","answer":"For a contract to be valid, there needs to be 'consideration' given to both sides, which is legalese for 'something of value', including money, credit, service or goods. In the case of your neighbors, you are not giving them any considerationWith your bank, you are engaged in a contract, with each of you receiving consideration. Generally, you get consideration in the form of a) safekeeping of your money, b) transfer service of your money (electronically and in the form of checks), and c) interest, however good or pitiful it may be. You bank generally gets consideration in the form of a) any fees you pay and b) the right to use your money in fractional reserve banking to make loans to other people.Generally, with a bank contract, there is generally no temporal binding on your relationship; by which I mean, there is no penalty (with perhaps the loss of a promotional interest rate) if you were to withdraw all of your funds today without any notice and close your account. (Though some savings account have withdrawal delays that the bank may or may not choose to invoke, but that is more for avoiding 'runs' more than anything else). However, a bank can also choose to stop doing business with you, close your account, and give you your money, ending the relationship. Because you don't have a temporal binding in your contract, it can do so at any time. It can also refuse to do business with you under the existing terms, and only continue business on new terms.For example, lets say that you have a lawn, and we have a contract (noting that a contract need not necessarily be written down) that I come by every Saturday and Tuesday morning and mow it, for which you pay me $20 a week. At any time, I could refuse to continue under the current terms, and demand new ones, which you could acquiesce to, refuse, or make a counter offer. So if I came to you and demanded $40 dollars a week, you could agree, refuse (and either end the contract or continue offering $20 a week for two days mowing), or counter offer, perhaps offering $30 or my only coming on Saturdays to mow the lawn for the original $20.EDIT: Note that this process doesn't work with a loan, because with a loan, there is technically only a single transaction: the lender trades the one-time consideration of the loan (money) for the borrower's binding promise to repay the money, by a specified schedule with a specified rate of interest.You actually have three options here: accept the new terms, send a letter to opt out, or stop using the service and terminate the contract that you have in place with your bank (which should be relatively simple and painless, EDIT: Unless you have a loan, but if you did, said loan would almost certainly not be affected by the change in terms, as one side cannot unilaterally change a loan contract). The reason for the opt out clauses is that binding arbitration clauses are under fire, with many (myself included) believing that they infringe on important rights. The opt-out clause, which gives you the option not be bound by the clause if you take action, is intended to be more palatable to judges, who might otherwise be more inclined to strike the contract in its entirety or otherwise create precedent hostile to arbitration.As for the required format of the opt-out notice: yes, they are intentionally making it difficult for you to file it; however, they have chosen a format that is judicially recognized and until very recently, was the default means of judicially recognized communication. It was only in the last few years that courts have allowed for text messages, emails, etc. to be used for official court communications, such as summons, subpoenas and other serviced documents. Before that, the only option was mail, preferably certified, or in some cases, newspaper announcements, if mail service could not be used."}

I met someone who claims she doesn't have a surname (her parents and siblings all have surnames, her story is that her parents made an exception for her and didn't give her a surname).","answer":"It is technically legal, but enforcement of such legality would face insurmountable difficulties without a compelling commercial interest.LegalityA   states thatAn influential 1979 law reviewarticle concluded that when parents agree, they should have the freedom to give their children any reasonable surname. Courts coulddisallow a surname chosen for a child by his parents if it were sooutrageous or obscene that it was clearly not in the child's best interests to bear the surname. But terms like reasonable and outrageous are highly subjective and give little guidance to courts on whatfactors to take into account.The most relevant bodies of constitutional doctrine are substantive due process jurisprudence under the Fourteenth Amendment andfree speech jurisprudence under the First Amendment. This Part develops the arguments for a parental naming right under both bodies oflaw, and concludes that strict scrutiny is the relevant standard for analyzing restrictions on that right. It further concludes that current lawsprohibiting certain surnames and laws prohibiting diacritical marksare unconstitutional, as they are not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. Laws against obscenities, ideograms andpictograms, and certain length restrictions pass strict scrutiny, as dorequirements that the child receive at least two names.Meaning that in the absence of a state law prohibiting a certain naming convention, anything goes.  But states have the power to pass laws to narrowly define what kinds of names are contrary to &quot;compelling state interest.&quot;A , applicable to change of surname in a divorce in Wisconsin, concluded that, because of Jocius v Jocius, &quot;child's best interest&quot; is not a standard available to Wisconsin courts to empower the courts to force a change of a child's name contrary to parents' wishes.  Such legislation can be passed, but it hasn't been.ImpracticalityHowever, some of costs associated with having a blank last name would be:obtaining insurancehaving any medical proceduresregistering for schoolgetting a library cardand many, many more.  In fact, the last two are currently technically impossible because Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction  that &quot;first and last name are required.&quot;It is likely that overcoming the confusion resulting from not having a last name would turn most daily life activities into something that would require a letter from an attorney, or even a court order.  Without a substantial commercial gain from this arrangement, this would be an experiment with an unjustified prohibitive cost.Lighter sideThe day-to-day difficulties resulting from the absurdities of such an experiment could be easily developed into a plot for a comedy.  Personally, I was imagining a few potential South Park plot lines while trying to think through the implications of this arrangement.The likely outcome, of not having a real last name, would be that many clerks would end up simply making them up for such an individual, in order to accommodate their computer systems.  And hilarity would undoubtedly ensue.Edit  while I appreciate the &quot;+1&quot;-for-the-effort gesture of the upvotes, I am actually surprised that this answer has gotten as many upvotes as it has.  I would gladly delete it if a better referenced answer, with more specific information, came along.  I wrote this mostly to list the references which I found.  The conclusion which I draw here is what I personally have been able to deduce from those references.  So, please, stop upvoting.  This is not a high-quality answer.

{"question":"I've noticed that in preparation for closing on a house, a title search is done.  What is the name of the document that is produced when the title search is complete?  And does that document need to be signed by an attorney?  Is a notarized signature required?  Is it customary?","answer":"  I've noticed that in preparation for closing on a house, a title  search is done. What is the name of the document that is produced when  the title search is complete?There are several kinds of products of a title search that could be produced. The smallest and cheapest, but not usually sufficient for a closing on real estate, is an O&amp;E for 'ownership and encumbrance report' which lists the current owner of record and current debts that the property is subject to based upon a superficial, non-guaranteed search.Another product is an abstract of title, which is a list of all recorded documents related to the title of the property, sometimes discarding documents that are 'wild deeds' or are barred by adverse possession doctrines (a sort of statute of limitations that gives someone with a long chain of uninterrupted title priority over someone who has older documents that arguably given them an interest in the property).A third product is a title commitment. This document states that the title insurance company is insuring and guaranteeing that a certain person will own the property free and clear subject to only specified encumbrances and easements of record, if certain steps are taken (i.e. if the required documents are paid at closing and the identified debts are paid in the amounts listed). Often there are lots of exceptions for easements, HOA organization documents, special taxing districts, mineral rights, water rights, etc.In the Western U.S., normally a title commitment is the main document used at closing. In the Eastern U.S., a title abstract followed by an insured opinion letter regarding title from an attorney is more common.  And does that document need to be signed by an attorney?In the Eastern U.S., for example, in New York State, this is restricted to attorneys. In many Western U.S. states one does not have to be an attorney to do an abstract or a title commitment or to issue title insurance, although title insurance companies generally have an attorney on staff even though most routine cases are done by title officers and paralegals who are not lawyers.  Is a notarized signature required? Is it customary?A notarized signature is neither required nor customary unless offered as evidence in opposition to a motion for summary judgment in a court case."}
{"question":" Suppose I see a child left in a hot car.

They see that I Googled how to break into a car. Could there be any legal consequences for me?","answer":"The Google search is not itself a crime or any other kind of offense.It could be used as circumstantial evidence that you did something intentionally or with pre-mediation, rather than accidentally, or not at all.If you can provide an alternative explanation for the search that is plausible, such as the one in the question, and there isn't a close proximity of time, a jury is unlikely to give the search much weight as circumstantial evidence. But ultimately, the weight to give any piece of evidence is for the jury to decide in the context of all of the evidence in the case combined."}
{"question":"Federal and State governments require businesses to post  where employees can see them. Failing to do so can result in fines.I run a small business - a single-member LLC - from my home. Do I really have to post labor law signage in my home for the only employee (myself)?If more background is needed, this I do IT consulting and web design. I have some sub-contractors, but they also work from their homes. I understand in their cases, I can send them the posters in digital form. But what about for myself?","answer":"The spirit of the law would imply digesting the info and appropriately retaining the documents for your reference.  The letter of the law would imply posting.  Labor law postings are a great example of a 'rule' (rather than a more forgiving 'standard'): it works well in general but has odd consequences in certain situations.  This is one of those situations.I couldn't find an instance where the courts dealt with the manner of posting for a home-based, single-member LLC.  We'd surmise this is because regulators probably aren't interested in committing scarce resources to enforcement of fringe cases where a single-owner has complied with the spirit of a law whose text doesn't address the situation particularly well.J.J. Keller's  suggests that for home-based employees, you can attempt to show a 'good faith' effort by either sending posters (maybe you print and file them) or making them available for reference electronically."}
{"question":"Do toll fees have to be indicated ahead of time in the United States to be enforceable?By indication, I mean some type of road sign. By 'ahead of time,' I mean early enough on the road to allow drivers to choose an alternative route. If the answer is state specific, I am mostly interested for in the states of California, Florida, and Massachusetts.","answer":"In California, the law for public bridges and highways appears to be as follows (emphasis mine):Any person who operates a motor vehicle over a toll bridge or toll highway crossing and the approaches thereto constructed or acquired by any bridge and highway district, at the entrance to which appropriate signs have been erected to notify traffic that it is entering upon a toll bridge crossing or its approaches and is subject to the payment of tolls beyond the sign, is guilty of a misdemeanor in each of the following cases:(a) If the person refuses to pay the tolls.(b) If the person turns, or attempts to turn, the vehicle around in the bridge, approach, or toll plaza where signs have been erected forbidding the turning.(c) If the person refuses to pass through the toll gates after having come within the area where signs have been erected notifying traffic that it is entering the area where toll is collectible or where vehicles may not turn around and where vehicles are required to pass through the toll gates for the purpose of collecting tolls.So it appears the &quot;last exit before toll&quot; signs are sufficient. It doesn't say anything about posting the actual cost of the tolls."}
{"question":"Recently  that it was done because of some 'legal concerns.'Given that: exist on main Meta and are featured there, andthe problematic post is still present on MSO, only that the 'featured' tag got removed from itWhat kind of legal concerns might cause such an action? If the post content is problematic, only removing the post (or the problematic part) would help. Featuring posts is a responsibility of moderators, who represent the community, not the company, so I don't think there is a risk of treating the post (or its being featured) as a statement coming from company. So what concerns might be present here?","answer":"RiskAssuming there the post has or, more likely, has the potential to become a legal liability then not having it featured reduces the risk of that occurring or the consequences if it does because fewer people see it.For example, assume that a hypothetical post potentially exposes SE to a defamation suit. Reducing the number of people who see the post reduces the chance that the hypothetical poster ever sees it. Further, damages for defamation depend on the extent of damage to reputation - all else being equal, the more people who see it the more damage is done.So why not get rid of it and eliminate the risk altogether? Because legal risk is only one sort of business risk. SE has a reputational risk issue right now and the consequences of being too heavy handed may outweigh the legal risk. Some risks just have to be accepted."}

{"question":"I vaguely recall in the case of Oracle v. Google in regards to Java v. Android that was happening in a district court physically located in San Jose, California, that one of the jurors was familiar with the process and procedure of acquiring patents, and there was some controversy in regards to this fact (he was sharing his experience with the rest of the jurors).Is a juror having a prior knowledge of law, other than what has been presented to them in the specific court case, allowed to teach others about any such understandings they have held prior to the start of the proceedings?  Is it cause for them to be disqualified, or even for the whole panel to be disqualified?","answer":"I finally found the actual transcript of the voir dire part of the case mentioned in the question.As can be evidenced from the transcript, the judge has specifically instructed the two jurors working as engineers at the local tech companies that they'd have to &quot;forget&quot; what they know about both the software engineering and the patent law itself, too, starting their work on the whole case with a completely clean sheet, using a very simple criteria for making decisions:One side or the other is going to have the burden of proof on -- one side has the burden of proof on some issues, the other side has the burden of proof on other issues. When you go into the jury room to deliberate after you've tried your hardest to understand the evidence, if they haven't educated you on it or if they haven't persuaded you, the party with the burden of proof loses. It's that simple. You don't have to -- you have to make a good faith effort to understand it, but if the party with the burden of proof has failed to do that, the party with the burden of proof loses. That's the standard. You have to -- you, the jury, decide.Now, what you cannot do is bring to bear something that you've learned in some other case, some other patent case, about how some piece of equipment works or something like that. You can't do that. It has to be based on the record here.Then, after a short break and a consultation with the lawyers, where Oracle seems to have expressed some concern to having the computer experts be on the panel, which subsequently prompted the judge to declare the following to the two potential jurors who worked at Cisco and HP:So this is really going to be directed at both of you, but, you know, you come to the party, so to speak, with some prior training that bears upon the subject matter we're going to be hearing a lot about here. That's okay. That's not disqualifying, but you -- it's okay to use your common sense when you render a verdict, but you cannot add to the record in court something that you know about the way software programming works that the witnesses didn't actually testify to. You see what I'm saying?You've got to decide the record -- the case based on the record made here as opposed to adding into it what else you may have known about the way programming and software works.Since both jurors had so much software and patent experience that they couldn't disregard it easily, they were thus both excused (page 95 of 224).All right. I think it would be too hardfor you to sit in this case and sort out what you knew alreadyagainst what is proven or not proven here, and itwould not befair to the parties to have that extra burden even though youtwo actually know something about the subject. It's in a waytoo bad, but it's for the best. So you two are excused to goback to the jury assembly room. Thank you.The other instructions that the judge gives to the potential jurors is also worth reading (starts on page 36 of 224)The full transcript is at .In summary -- jurors are only allowed to talk to one another when the deliberation process starts, and, no, they are not allowed to bring any &quot;baggage&quot; to the case at stake."}
{"question":"In case of disputes related to the presidential election, who has the final say in the choice of the electors: state legislature, SCOTUS or the state's supreme court?It's my understanding that the US constitution says it's state legislature, but Trump recently claimed voter fraud and stated his intent to get SCOTUS involved. If the answer is the courts, what kind of remedies can they possibly provide?","answer":"SCOTUS has final say w.r.t. matters of US law, especially the interpretation of the constitution. If a state legislature acts unconstitutionally, and that state's supreme court, upholds the action, an party with standing could challenge the action at SCOTUS. They have discretion to hear, or decline to hear the case. While I agree without your interpretation of what the US Constitution says, we don't know what such a challenge would be based on, for example Equal Protection, which is another US Constitutional principle that states must comply with."}

{"question":"With my research, it looks like a patent doesn't really make much profit from it due to the high maintenance fee. So I'm thinking is it possible to license my idea to public (for free or way less money) so that anyone can integrate into their product while they can't register as their patent. Something like Creative Common for innovations. Is there such a method?","answer":"You are correct that it is quite expensive to patent something in U.S. law.Under U.S. patent law, once an idea is publicly published, if no one else has a patent application for the same idea that is pending, the idea enters the public domain and no one can obtain a patent of that idea. The publication become 'prior art' with respect to any future patent application which cannot be protected by patent law.Of course, if you publish an invention which you discovered independently, that someone else already has a patent application pending for that will be approved the following week, the fact that you published it after the patent was applied for doesn't prevent the person with the pending patent application from having it approved.The term 'invention' rather than 'idea' is what I will use for the remainder of this answer, because there are many ideas which may not be patented, while the lion's share of patentable ideas are appropriately described as 'inventions.' But, understand that as used in this answer, the term 'invention' is being used to refer to the concepts and ideas necessary to make the invention, and not to a particular instance of a product made using those concepts and ideas.When an invention is in the public domain, anyone can utilize the invention free of charge without a license. People who use the invention are not even required to acknowledge that you invented or discovered it.An invention is also not eligible to be patented if more than a year has elapsed since the first sale of a product using it. But, in that case, the invention can still be protected as a trade secret until it is voluntarily disclosed in some fashion to someone who is not subject to a non-disclosure agreement. (I say voluntary, because the fact that, for example, an unauthorized corporate spy sees the trade secret doesn't end the status of the invention as a trade secret.)Some inventions, are effectively publicly disclosed and published the moment that anyone looks at it closely. The patentable element of other inventions are invisible to an end user, or to observer of an end user.For example, if the invention involves something in the interior of a device, or the invention involves something not visible to the naked eye (e.g. a process for synthesizing an industrial chemical from other chemicals where the chemical formula of the ingredients and end result can't be determined without a microscope or analytical chemistry tests), merely showing someone a product made using the invention will not put it in the public domain.It is generally legal to reverse engineer or independently come up with an invention which is merely a trade secret. It is not legal to use a patented invention or process, even if it is not directly copied and is instead reverse engineered or independently discovered, during the lifetime of the patent.There is no straightforward way to put an invention into the public domain while retaining any right to acknowledgement that you invented it or otherwise exercise control through a licensing agreement without patenting it."}
{"question":"There are plenty of ways that people \"trick\" self-checkout machines into giving them discounts.  Some popular ways include:When the machine asks what item is being weighed, intentionally choosing a cheaper item.When the machine asks for quantity, intentionally underrepresenting the quantity chosen.Using the barcode of a cheaper item and placing a more expensive item in the basket.Using online applications to generate fraudulent manufacturer discount coupon barcodes, and feed them to the machine as legitimate coupons.What is the actual crime and\/or tort being committed when people do this?","answer":"Yes, a crime is committed as is a tort. The exact crime would vary from state to state. The most common description of this crime and tort would be &quot;fraud&quot; but the way that criminal conduct is allocated between particular offenses in states varies considerable.

{"question":"There is currently a number of claims being made, on cable tv, stating that information can be considered an in-kind contribution to a political campaign because it benefits the campaign and because some information, which is not in the public domain, is often exchanged for payments by other political campaigns.However, this view seems to make it impossible to share information with a political campaign without being compensated for it.  If the value of such information exceeds the allowed contribution limit, then this would be a direct restriction on free political speech. So is there a legal standard which distinguishes between 'a thing of value' and 'a thing of benefit' to a political campaign as far as what is considered an in-kind contribution?","answer":" says that  A foreign national shall not, directly or indirectly, make a  contribution or a donation of money or other thing of value, or  expressly or impliedly promise to make a contribution or a donation,  in connection with any Federal, State, or local election.In connection with this, the Federal Election Commission has expressed an opinion in  bearing on this topic  the Act and Commission regulations also provide that the term  contribution does not include the value of services provided  without compensation by any individual who volunteers on behalf of a  candidate or political committee.  2 U.S.C. 431(8)(B)(i); see also 11  CFR 100.74.By contrast, if a foreign volunteer supplies 'stuff' (a donut), that is a thing of value, as legally defined. This despite the fact that 100 hours of labor usually costs more than a donut. In another letter,  the FEC opined that paid information is a thing of value:  If, however, Mr. Hochberg imparts poll result information to you or  anyone else working for your campaign, including any data or any  analysis of the results, or if he uses the poll information to advise  your campaign on matters such as campaign strategy or creating media  messages, such poll information will constitute an in-kind  contribution from Mr. Hochberg to your campaign, and an expenditure in  an equal amount by your committee.

{"question":"When an argument in a court case relies on the specifics of a statute, and that case goes to trial, how does that statute typically get presented to the opposing party and the judge?  Does the attorney (or self represented party) typically just quote the relevant portions of the law, or do they provide a copy of it to the judge and\/or other party?If it were an exhibit, the rules seem pretty clear about that a copy of the evidence would be provided to both the judge and the opposing party.  I'm no legal expert, but unless I'm mistaken this doesn't seem like it would be an exhibit, since it's a law and not a piece of evidence.Since the specifics of the statute can be very relevant to the argument, it seems important that both parties and the judge have access to the referenced statute.The particular case I have in mind would be a civil trial, but this seems something just as relevant for trials of other types.How does this typically work in practice?","answer":"One does not introduce statutes in a trial, criminal of civil. Rather, one introduces facts. The judge will present &quot;the law&quot;, and will present it in a digested form in the form of interpreted instructions to the jury about what the law says. Jurors are not required to interpret the meaning of statutes, because jurors are also not expected to know the relevant case law surrounding a statute.A party might make a motion to the judge where the argument depends in part on the wording of a statute.

{"question":"In the USA, could a Supreme Court judge quit and run for President?Has it ever happened?","answer":"While there are no rules barring it, it would be unlikely for two reasons.  But before that, let's get down to the basics:  In the U.S. one may hold office in one branch of government and seek office in another branch of government.  It's only upon winning the election that the politician must give up his\/her original office since the elected official cannot hold an office in two branches of government at the same time.  However, in the case of SCOTUS, it's very unlikely to happen for two reasons that are more practical than legal:First, the final months of campaigning coincides with some of the busiest times of the year for SCOTUS as the end of June usually marks the end of the term for SCOTUS (Terms are generally span the latter half of calendar year and the first half of the next.  The most recently finished term as of time of writing was the 2020-2021 term and we are presently a month into the 2021-2022 term) and they usually have massive dumps of decisions in cases heard the previous year (Usually one controversial case a day, with a bunch of cases the public writ large has little interest in).  July, August, and September are usually a vacation period where they get a much needed break before the next Term begins on the First Monday of October, but the Justices still have administration work to do as well.Why this is important is because June\/July in the U.S. election cycle is usually when the party convention is held, which is where the nominee for the party is named officially and a major event kicking off the final months of the campaign.   October is also a very critical moment in the election cycle as it represents the final month of campaigning before the election, which is the First Tuesday after the First Monday of November.  In American politics, there's a term called &quot;October Surprise&quot; where the real dirt of a candidate is often revealed by the other candidate as it will be the most damaging and offer the least amount of time for the candidate to respond meaningfully.   As these are busy times for both the court and the campaign, a SCOTUS justice making a bid for President might be unable to mount a meaningful campaign.The second reason is tenure:  SCOTUS Justices are for life or until the justice decides to retire from the bench, while the President is for at least four years and at most 8 years.  While the President makes more money in terms of annual pay, Justices will make more money between nomination and retirement and will have a fairly safe job barring any impeachment charges being brought (No SCOTUS Justice has ever been impeached in 200+ years).  And the change in power isn't that much greater.All that said, this has never happened but the reverse situation did occur:  William Howard Taft was the U.S.'s 27th President and in 1921 following his two terms in office, President Warren Harding nominated Taft to be the 10th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States."}
{"question":"This is a belated follow up to an  question where I asked how one can get away with hiring actors of an appropriate race when  BFOQ (Bona Fide Occupational Qualifications) exceptions do not apply to race.  The answer was that you can't insist on hiring someone who is black, but you can require someone that looks black.So taking that to the logical extreme if one employer is allowed to make requirements based off of one's apparent race why can't others?  If I have some organization that panders to racist folks can I say I need all my servers to look like the appropriate race so that I don't offend my clientele?I'm pretty sure (and hope!) the answer is that this isn't legal, but what I'm wondering is more what the distinction between these two cases is.  How is the line drawn between the few legitimate reasons where hiring someone based off of the race they appear to be makes sense and all the numerous occasions where it would just be an end-run around refusing to hire someone based off of race?  Is there an actual hard and fast line here?  Has there been a court case where someone tried to hire only people that appear white as a means of discrimination and the courts gave a ruling specifying why it wasn't allowed?","answer":"In the case of an actor, the actor's appearance, even the actor's detailed appearance, is pretty clearly a BFOQ. The actor must fit the director's (or producer's) vision of the role, and fit into the rest of the cast visually (or stand out in the way wanted for the particular production.) For example, in a traditional production of Othello the actor must look Black.  In a crime drama set in inner-city Los Angles, the actor must seem to fit that setting, and quite possible must look Hispanic, depending on the details of the drama and role.This is not true for most occupations. The employer has no legitimate interest in how a truck driver or cook looks.

{"question":"After searching on USPTO names of characters fron Dota 2 and Warcraft, I found that most names are  not trademarked. Does this means these names are free to use as a software name?","answer":"Under US law, trademarks are only protected if they are &quot;used in commerce&quot;. In general this means the mark is used to describe or label a product or service, or to advertise it.Note that words and images used in this way may get a degree of trademark protection even if they are not registered. Proof of use in commerce is sufficient to grant this protection.However, the names of characters are not usually used as identifications of a product or service, nor as designations of source. If they are not so used, they do not have trademark protection.If a reasonable person would be led by the use of a character name to incorrectly believe that the product had been authorized, sponsored, or endorsed by the creator of the character or a related entity, then that use might constitute an infringement. But usually this would not be the case.For example, a software company calling itself &quot;SauronWare&quot; and distributing a word processor called &quot;SauronWriter&quot; would probably not infringe on the intelelctual property of the Tolkien Estate.But trademark  law can be complex, and a would-be user wouldf be wise to consult a trademark lawyer.Note also that song, book, and story titles, character names, and other short phrases are not subject to copyright protection under US law (see Copyright Office Circular 33.)"}

{"question":"If prostitution is illegal in the US, but production of pornography legal, couldn't johns\/punters just offer prostitutes money for filming a pornographic movie instead of money in exchange of sex?","answer":"At least in the US, trying to evade one law (prostitution) by complying with another set of laws (porn film production) gets very complicated, very quickly and is a simply unrealistic endeavor. Laws are written with loopholes in mind, and even if there was an obvious loophole as you imagine, it could be closed rather quickly.To be more specific, any porn film production of any size is very heavily regulated at the state and federal level, and your legal liability in shooting even a simple, one off film without permits, insurance, taxes, etc., is much greater than the relatively simple simple prostitute\/john situation. Google 'porn film regulations' to get an idea of the differences."}

{"question":"Could it be done if you are not a citizen of the US?","answer":"Yes, non-citizens can set up non-profits.Because non-profits are tax exempt, to become a non-profit, you have to apply to the IRS.Before you can apply to the IRS for non-profit status, need to legally form your organization. Usually, that means incorporating your organization, although it can also be a trust or an association. In the US, forming organizations is controlled by states. You should double-check for your state, but as far as I can tell, all states allow non-citizens to form and run corporations.After you've set up your organization, you can apply to the IRS for non-profit status. They will check your plans and decide whether you qualify. Because a 501(c)(3) does not pay taxes, the IRS imposes additional requirements.Where to go for more information:Because business organizations are formed under state law, you'll need to check the requirements for your state. If you are lucky, your state government has a helpful website.

There might be some adverse selection argument for this sort of policy, but that's something for the insurer to explain.Note that there are laws (like fraud, and sometimes insurance-specific statutes) against knowingly misrepresenting risks to a contractual counterparty like an insurer, so if as a condition of selling you insurance they require you to disclose all vehicles and drivers in your household it could be illegal to not provide full disclosure."}

{"question":"Here's a scenario I've always been curious about.Suppose that a 15-year-old high school student in Oregon, USA, is called into the counselor's office because he was reported for having scars on his forearms. The counselor (who the student has no choice in going to see) requests\/demands to see the student's arms.Can the student legally refrain from showing his forearms to the counselor?","answer":"A school official might have the legal right to search you (without a warrant), if, following , they have a reasonable suspicion that the student has done something wrong (not necessarily a crime). However, students do have a reasonable expectation of privacy. The court ruled that schools do not have the same complete right to invade their child's privacy (likewise, schools do not have the same right to suppress speech of children). If the counselor has a reasonable suspicious of wrong-doing, a warrantless search would be legal.It does not follow, though, that a student may resist such an order without consequences. The courts, and not the student, will determine whether the suspicion is reasonable. There does not appear to be case law establishing one way or the other whether the official must even articulate a reason for the search (students relent and sue later). A student can 'legally' refuse the search (the official cannot batter the student to perform the search); but there probably is a rule that if you refuse a search request, you will be suspended (such a suspension was upheld in  as a random district in Oregon, they do state that 'The school may search a student if the school has a reasonable suspicion that a prohibited or dangerous item will be found'. They also articulate disciplinary procedures for student violating the rules, and on p. 12 include a broad form of prohibited misbehavior, 'refusing to follow directions'. They are supposed to engage in lower-level discipline ('conferences', with school officials, which parents may attend) before imposing stiff penalties such as expulsion.Suppose a student had been in an accident years before and had disfiguring scars on his forearm. An official could not search the students arms to satisfy voyeuristic curiosity: there is no reasonable suspicious of wrongdoing. Suppose on the other hand the student had needle tracks on his arms from drug injections: a rumor to that effect would create a reasonable suspicion that the student was abusing drugs. You can sue to find out if their suspicion was reasonable."}
{"question":"A friend of mine was doing business with Company A, and asked a lawyer to draft a contract saying that if Company A failed to perform, my friend would be able to take possession of Asset X (the critical asset), as an indemnity so that he could do the job himself. The lawyer drafted a contract with Asset Y (a totally different Asset) as indemnity. Further, he attached several Exhibits to the contract that don't clearly relate to either Asset X or Y, and only confuse the picture.Company A failed to perform, but won't hand over Asset X, and my friend doesn't have the indemnity that he envisioned because of the way the contract was drafted. (A first year law student could probably have done better.) That's the causation. The harm comes from the fact that my friend now has to sue Company A, which might not be necessary if the contract was solid. The breach of duty comes from the disregard of instructions to 'securitize' Asset X.Does this constitute legal malpractice, and if so, what are the remedies?

{"question":"Say I'm creating an  where I want players to be contacted by an FBI agent through email. Ideally, in order for players to remain immersed, the email would appear to be actual communication from a real FBI agent. Since players have to provide an email address beforehand, and they do so in the context of the ARG, they should be aware that these emails are not actual FBI communication, but there's a real risk that players either sign up other people who are unaware or that players sign up and forget about it before receiving anything.My question is two-fold: is it legal to impersonate a government agent if most reasonable parties don't actually believe me to be a government agent? And if not, what precautions should I take to ensure no one thinks the emails are legit, hopefully without hurting immersion?(I'm based in the United States, but the game could be played by any English speaker, so I tagged the question with  - let me know if I should change that)","answer":"I would go to the FBI.gov website and see what server they are using publicly (it should be [account]@fbi.gov, but I'm not 100% certain.).  Then make sure your email is not remotely close.  Government e-mail accounts tend to follow a schema for how they are created using the users name, so you will also want to avoid that schema so if someone sends to your address @FBI.Gov, it will automatically bounce as the account name is wrongly formatted and thus not in the server.I would also recommend you call FBI Public Relations and ask for their opinion of best practices for making a fictitious e-mail account for an equally fictitious agent.   Don't be surprised if they say it's a crime and won't help you, but their a fairly popular agency to portray in fiction (I'm sure the 90s were full of applicants trying to get into the fictional X-Files department).  You wouldn't be the first person to ask how to do it without causing a panic.In universe, you should mention that the contents of the e-mail are highly classified and that under no circumstances should the contents be discussed with anyone but the contacting agent through the e-mail he has sent you.  This not only discourages talking to the real FBI, but is also an immersive way to do that.  Proper format for classified material should be avoided, so it's legally distinct that it's not something from the Government (all Federal agencies follow the same guidelines on how to properly mark the classification of the e-mail).  It can further contribute to the don't talk to anyone line if you mention that the document is 'compartmentalized' and only given on a 'need to know basis'.  This is something that not only sounds cool, but is really done.  Just because some has a Top Secret clearance, it doesn't mean they can access information... classified materials are frequently compartmentalized which means that you need to be read into a program to see the information and that determination is on a 'need to know' basis.   The FBI agent may have a Top Secret clearance, but he doesn't need to know about the workings of the latest Air-force stealth-jet to do his job... so he's not allowed to see that information.  Similarly, the Air-force engineer doesn't need to know who is being investigated for spying on the U.S., so he can't see that stuff... but he can see stealth-jet designs because he's working on the project.Again, ask the PR contact in the FBI what is the correct way to create an immersive document that will clearly look fake to agents... but looks real to the public.Edit:  And don't be afraid of asking the PR person in detail.  'It's for a book' or similar phrases actually work wonders in just about any organization, not just government.  "}

{"question":"Suppose, for example, that Colorado wants to pass a law that bars convicted criminals from appearing on the Presidential ballot (so Colorado voters can't vote for a Presidential candidate who is convicted of a crime)Would the Presidential Qualifications Clause of the US constitution prohibit Colorado from passing this law?","answer":"It would not prohibit Colorado from passing the law, but it could prohibit implementing the law. SCOTUS rulings (Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486; Term Limits, 514 U.S. 779) establish that neither Congress nor the States can require additional qualifications of federal candidates beyond those listed in the Constitution. The relevant question is whether a law imposes an additional &quot;qualification&quot; on a candidate for president. Every state imposes at least one requirement on a person seeking to be a candidate on the ballot in a state: they must somehow &quot;register&quot; as a candidate. So the Qualifications Clause is not interpreted to mean &quot;anybody can run for president as long as age and natural-born&quot;. The  allows certain kinds of requirements to be imposed on candidates, namely those that relate to a state's interest on properly managing elections. A no-felon law would clearly go way beyond the accepted state interest (regarding management of elections) reflected in Anderson-Burdick, and would be found to be as unconstitutional as requiring a candidate for president to have a law degree, or prohibiting a candidate from having a law degree."}

The district court granted the injunction, and the Supreme Court affirmed. Because video games are protected by the First Amendment, and because banning sales to minors is not a narrowly tailored way to achieve any compelling governmental interest, the law was merely &quot;the latest episode in a long series of failed attempts to censor violent entertainment for minors.&quot;The restrictions you seem to be imagining roughly mirror those imposed in California, so I suspect that any attempt to impose them by another government (in the United States) could not survive a First Amendment challenge.Note that the answer in the E.U. could be quite different, as the American approach to free speech is rather unique."}
{"question":"In the text of the Australian constitution, the phrase 'Original States' (the States when the federation was established) appears in two places which are still relevant today, such as in Section 7 (The Senate):Until the Parliament otherwise provides there shall be six senators for each Original State.

However, I will address the legal issues and offer some speculation on the politics.The states named in the preamble to the Constitution (an Act of British Parliament) as original states were New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. Western Australia was not named at the time of the passing of the Act or Royal Assent because the people of that colony had not vet made their mind up.Legal IssuesWA decided to join in a vote held on 31 December 1900 and Australia came into being on 1 January 1901. Therefore, even though not named as such, WA was an 'original state'. Since all 6 states in the Federation are 'original states' the clauses have no practical effect at present.However, there have been a number of proposals to add , either by subdividing existing states or by granting statehood to the territories of Northern Territory and\/or the Australian Capital Territory. If such were to come to pass, the clauses would have practical effect.In 1998, Norther Territorials  an offer of statehood that would have given them 3 senators as a state and 2 representatives based on population (currently they have 2 senators and 2 representatives). Clearly, they were not being given the same privileges as an 'original state'.In 2015 all Australian governments  in principle that the NT should become a state by 2018, however, as it is now 2017 and no action has been taken this seems unlikely.Political IssuesPolitics is complicated: just as much in the late 19th century as it is in the early 21st. Negotiations between the colonies were fraught and federation was by no means a certain outcome. New Zealand and Fiji dropped out early and each forged its own path to nationhood. However, by the late 1890s it was clear that the 5 eastern colonies would federate with or without .It seems likely that this provision served multiple purposes including:putting pressure on WA to join at the outset - the deal they got as a 'Johnny come lately' may not have been as good.protecting  - the drafters of the Constitution were men of their times, that is to say: racist, misogynist bigots.

{"question":" for the statement:In a democratic society privacy of communication is essential if citizens are to think and act creatively and constructively. Fear or suspicion that one's speech is being monitored by a stranger, even without the reality of such activity, can have a seriously inhibiting effect upon the willingness to voice critical and constructive ideas.I have two questions about this citation:Is it clear whether the report is being used as a legal or factual source? To me it sounds legal, though I see how it could be read as factual.Are President's commissions' reports usually considered legal sources?","answer":"Judgements in a common law jurisdiction are based on reasoning about how the law applies to the facts. It is a fiction to believe that there is a clear delineation between law and fact - the facts inform the law and vice-versa and the means by which they do so is the reasoning of the judge(s); that is how precedent works.Furthermore, theoretically (see above) an appellate court does not make findings regarding fact; an appeal can only be based on a mistake in law. That is, an appeal is an argument that the lower court made a mistake in reasoning about how the law applies to the facts.So, on that basis, the report is being used as a legal source.I will venture to suggest that the way the report was used was to inform the reasoning process that court used. The justice is effectively saying: 'These learned people who have looked into the general expectation in the USA regarding privacy of communication and have said this; I agree with what they say so I will use that as the basis for my reasoning.' This serves two purposes: it shows us what the justice was thinking when he built the links in his judgement and it shows us why he was thinking this way.When you think about it this way it becomes easier to understand how and why multi-judge appeal courts can have split decisions. The facts are the same to each judge, the law in the form of statute and precedent is the same to each judge but each judge's reasoning process is different. A different process leads to different results.A judge can consider anything a legal source, in the sense that it informs their decision making process.Judges can and do look to many things to inform their reasoning process. They will often look to:dictionariestextbooksspeeches made in legislaturecases in other jurisdictions commissions of enquiryacademic papersetc.A judgement must be based on the law and the facts and decided on a basis that the parties argued (deciding on a basis that was not raised can be a failure to afford natural justice). Furthermore it needs to set out the reasoning process in sufficient detail, that:the parties can see why they won or (especially) why they lostan appeals court can consider if the reasoning was sound. It is worth noting that while a case decided in the Supreme Court is not subject to appeal; the precedent created may be overturned by the Supreme Court latter on and so it is vital that that group of Justices knows what the hell the previous group was thinking.

{"question":"Person A has a need to find person B.They do not know person B's name or other identity, but know they are somewhere in New York City, New York, USA.But they know the following about B: within last 4 years, B was a parent involved in a court case where their older adult child won custody of their younger underage child from them.Some information about the children is known but not precise identity (let's say birthday and first name for one of them is known; as well as ages).The only way I can think of to find person B would be to review every single court case involving custody in New York City, and see if the information about the winners matches the known info.Question #1: is this even possible? Is there some sort of central database which contains details of all recent court cases involving custody of children in New York City?Question #2: If this is theoretically possible, who would have access\/privilege to do this? Any random person? A registered lawyer? Police? Court officer?I am assuming that custody case info would be somewhat protected, unlike criminal cases, but do not know enough to be sure. ","answer":"  Question #1: is this even possible? Is there some sort of central  database which contains details of all recent court cases involving  custody of children in New York City?Yes, it is possible. The court clerk for each respective court in the State of New York maintains a list of every case pending that court that goes back many years in electronic form, and there is some minimal classification by case type although the classifications used might not precisely match what you are looking for - it might be necessary to include more than one kind of case and some classification categories might be over broad for your purposes.There are probably at least three courts that could have jurisdiction over this kind of case in New York City. The Supreme Court (i.e. the trial court of general jurisdiction) which has jurisdiction over custody cases that are incident to a divorce or legal separation and in certain other cases, for example, criminal felony child abuse and neglect cases take place in the Supreme Court; the Family Court, a court of limited jurisdiction which lacks jurisdiction over divorces and legal separations but often handles custody matters involving unmarried couples, custody determinations incident to allegations of child abuse or neglect, and post-decree child custody matters; and the Surrogate's Court, which handles custody determinations incident to deaths and incident to some incapacity determinations (as guardianships of minors) and if I recall correctly, incident to adoptions. It also isn't inconceivable that a de facto custody decision could also be made in another court incident to issuance of a protective order or criminal case.It is also quite possible that there may be multiple related cases in the same or separate court. For example, there might be a child abuse and neglect case terminating person B's parental rights in family court, and then a guardianship of a minor case appointing the adult child as guardian of the minor child in Surrogate's Court.It is quite possible that more than one database (or portion of a centralized database) would have to be reviewed, rather than a single database. When I practiced law actively in New York there was not a single database, but that was more than 20 years ago and given the explosive improvement in information technology that has taken place since then, it would not surprise me at all if some or all of the relevant databases have since been consolidated.   They do not know person B's name or other identity, but know they are  somewhere in New York City, New York, USA.    But they know the following about B: within last 4 years, B was a  parent involved in a court case where their older adult child won  custody of their younger underage child from them.    Some information about the children is known but not precise identity  (let's say birthday and first name for one of them is known; as well  as ages).Notwithstanding my answer to question #1, it wouldn't be easy. While birthdays and ages would be present in documents filed in the various court cases, they would not be indexed centrally. The index of case names would contain the names of the parties to the case, the general case type, and the case number, and possibly the assigned judges and the attorneys who entered an appearance in the case.Difficulties Involved In Searching By First NameUnless the first name was very unique, locating it in a central index could be very difficult.Also, it isn't at all uncommon for the day to day name that someone uses to differ from the person's legal name used in the court case caption, or for the person's name to be misspelled due to lack of accurate information or clerical error, or for a nickname of someone to be used instead of their legal name.For example, suppose that the person you are searching for has the legal name: Jonathan Ralph Lee. This could easily have an indexed first name of Jonathan, Jonathon, Johnathan, Johnathon, Jon, John, Ralph or some totally unrelated nickname in the central index.I know someone, for example, whose legal name is 'Claire' who uses the name 'Denny' which has no source in any part of her legal name, in all circumstances except legal documents, because at one point in her life that is what other people and she started to call her (for reasons that are not entirely clear to me), and it stuck. A nickname totally unrelated to a legal name is particularly common among people who immigrate to the U.S. or have parents who do, whose legal name is not commonly used in the U.S. For example, I know someone born in Korea whose true name is Hei-Hyun who used the name June, which she used in English as a second language classes when she was first learning English abroad, in almost all circumstances except in legal documents. In those cases, either the legal name or the nickname could easily appear in court documents.Everyday use of a middle name rather than a true first name is particularly common when father and son have the same true names apart from Senior and Junior or the third, for example, and when the first name is less common or otherwise embarrassing or overlaps with a classmate. I've also known people who used a first name growing up and then later transitioned to a middle name at some point (often upon moving to a new school or new place) and people who have transitioned in the opposite direction under similar circumstances, in each case in connection with a desire of the person involved to 'reinvent' themselves.Other Information Which Would Greatly Help In SearchingIt would be extremely helpful (cutting the number of cases involved dramatically) to know which borough within New York City this took place in, because at the level of court administration, each borough of New York City is a separate county with a separate set of court clerks and all case indexes would reveal the borough in which the case was brought.The more you can narrow the time period, the easier it is for you to conduct the search.If you knew the name of the school that the younger child who was subject to the custody order attended at any time and the younger child's first name and ethnicity, attempting to locate and review school yearbooks and newsletters in the relevant time period (often children are identified by name in newsletters listing children who won academic or attendance or sports awards, or who participated in special field trips, for example) would provide a much more solid basis for a further search of records related to person B, because this would give you a full name for the child and would also establish the most likely borough in which the records would be located. Often a list of parent names at the school can be found in PTA newsletters or lists in school newsletters of parent volunteers who are being thanked.If you knew the address of person B or the younger child or the older child at some point, this would be very helpful. If they lived in a home that they owned you could search property records to find a name of person B or someone related to person B. If they rented, you would still narrow down the likely school that the younger child attended, the likely courts in which the action could have taken place, and you could go in person to the neighborhood and ask former neighbors.Either a first name or a surname for person B, the parent, would also be extremely helpful, although a full name and borough of residence for person B would be much better and might limit the search, if you were authorized to make it, to just a handful of names. Knowing person B's gender would also help. If person B is the father, usually the child's surname will be the same as the father, while if person B was the mother and not married to the father, this would be much less common.The more you know about the precise nature of the proceeding, the better.It would be very unusual for an adult child rather than a parent to be awarded custody of a minor child outside of an abuse and neglect proceeding terminating person B's parental rights, or an adoption proceeding in which person B voluntarily relinquished his or her parental rights. So, the odds are good that you would want to search records in Family Court or Surrogate's Court, rather than in the Supreme Court which handles matrimonial actions.If person B were prosecuted criminally for child abuse or neglect, there is a very good chance that the person is incarcerated in a state prison at this time and so a search of prisoners with the right partial name who were incarcerated at about the right time and were of the right gender could be fruitful. This would be particularly helpful if person B is a woman because there are far fewer incarcerated women than there are men, and there are far few women's prisons than there are men's prisons.Knowing the name of the judge who handled the case would be extremely helpful and would greatly narrow the scope of the search. Also, if you identified the case with sufficient specificity in a request to the judge who handled the case to allow you to gain limited access to court records, it is quite likely that the judge would be able to identify the exact case involved with the help of court clerks from memory or partial memory of the case, making it much more likely that the judge would let you access the information that you needed. Media accounts of a case and appellate opinions arising from case (which are often publicly available in redacted form) are much more likely to identify the name of the judge than the name of the parties in a case involving a minor child.Knowing who represented person B as a lawyer, or in the alternative, knowing that person B was not represented by a lawyer, would help narrow the list considerably. If you knew who the lawyer was, calling the lawyer's office and asking in a manner that explained your need to know would probably be more likely to provide information that obtaining it directly from the court system. Knowing the name of the opposing counsel would be almost as helpful.If you new that person B acting pro se in the case, you could eliminate from the list all cases in which all parties were represented by a lawyer. This search could be made considerably more powerful if you knew the gender of person B as this would allow you to narrow the search to cases where someone of person B's gender was not represented by a lawyer.If the case was an abuse or neglect case, it would have been prosecuted in the name of the State or the People, so you would look for cases where the defendant was not represented by counsel without regard to the attorney for the plaintiff.  Question #2: If this is theoretically possible, who would have  access\/privilege to do this? Any random person? A registered lawyer?  Police? Court officer?Usually cases involving juveniles are closed to the general public, so to access them, you would need to be an 'interested party', and neither a 'random person' nor a lawyer admitted to the bar in New York State could do so without that connection. It might be possible to search case names that might contain the name of the child or the sibling without being allowed to access the contents of the file in some cases, I am not entirely sure on that point. If the case were incident to a case in which the child or the sibling was not a named party (e.g. the probate of a parent), this might not be sufficient to even identify the right case, however.A good summary regarding access to court records in New York State is available . In some of the pertinent parts, it states:  A number of statutes limit access to court records where the interest  in confidentiality outweighs the public interest in disclosure:    A. Family Court Records    Access to court records in the Family Court is governed by Section 166  of the Family Court Act, which provides that the records of any  proceeding in Family Court are not open to indiscriminate public  inspection. In order to access a particular Family Court record, the  requesting party must make an application to the Court and set forth  the reasons for the request. It is solely within the discretion of the  Court whether to permit the inspection of such records. Certain  individuals, such as the parties and their representatives, are  permitted access to Family Court records without application to the  Court. 22 NYCRR205.5Given that 'B was a parent involved in a court case where their older adult child won custody of their younger underage child from them.', it is conceivable that one could articulate a reason for the need to do the search that a Family Court judge would authorize, but that would depend to a great extent on the precise nature of the reason for the search. It helps that the person you are actually searching for is an adult who would have been a named party in the case, and not the actual minor child. But, a Family Court judge would probably be pretty reluctant to authorize a search on behalf of someone who didn't even know the name of the person being searched for and instead only knew the first name and age of one of that person's children. In part, this is because it indicates that the 'need' to locate person B is not very strong, and in part, this is because the search would be much more intrusive requiring review of actual court filings in many cases rather than merely reviewing the index of cases.It further states:  B. Civil Actions    Like criminal proceedings, civil actions are presumptively open  pursuant to the guarantees under the First Amendment. Unlike criminal  actions that present constitutional considerations for criminal  defendants, in civil actions the First Amendment guarantees must be  measured against the public interest in requiring disclosure.      Family Court Proceeding      The declaration in Section 4 of the Judiciary Law of a presumption of  public access to court proceedings does not differentiate among the  courts, and therefore applies to the Family Court, subject to any  other statute that gives special treatment to Family Court  proceedings. As such, there is also a presumption of openness to all  Family Court proceedings, and Section 205.4 of the Uniform Rules [22  NYCRR] expressly provides that the Family Court is open to the public,  including the media. However the presumption can be overcome on a  case-by-case basis by an overriding interest that closure is essential  to preserve higher values. See e.g., Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior  Court, 457 US. 596, 608; Matter of Ruben R., 219 A.D.2d 117 (1st  Dept.),lv. to app. denied 88 N.Y.2d 806 (1996) (holding potential  trauma to mental and physical well-being of children required closure  of child protective proceeding to public and press); Matter of  Katherine B., 189 A.D.2d 450 (2d Dept. 1993) (holding public properly  excluded from child protective proceeding where compelling testimony  established that child would be adversely affected).    Section 205.4 (b) of the Uniform Rules [22 NYCRR] provides specific  factors that a judge may consider in determining whether to close the  courtroom or to exclude specific individuals, such as preserving  courtroom decorum, avoiding a disruption in the proceedings, and  serving the orderly administration of justice, including privacy  interests of individuals before the court and the need to protect  litigants from harm.    <ol start='2'>  Matrimonial Proceedings      Domestic Relations Law 235(2) grants the court the discretion to  exclude the public if 'the public interest requires that the  examinations of the witnesses should not be public.' Because  matrimonial proceedings include matters concerning child custody,  visitation and maintenance, aside from potential embarrassment to the  litigants in a public proceeding, the public interest standard may  protect minors from public testimony. See CPLR 4019; Matter of  Lincoln v, Lincoln, 24 N.Y.2d 270 (1969) (trial court had discretion  to interview the child in a custody proceeding in private).    <ol start='3'>  Adoption Proceedings      Given the nature of adoption proceedings, the proceedings are  confidential and held in closed courts, and the records pertaining to  adoptions are sealed pursuant to Domestic Relations Law 114. See  Matter of Walker, 64 N.Y.2d 354 (1985) (setting forth the  considerations for deeming adoption records confidential).    <ol start='4'>  Mental Competency Proceedings      The media has a qualified right of access to competency hearings,  whether held pursuant to the Mental Hygiene Law or the Criminal  Procedure Law. See Matter of New York News v, Ventura, 67 N.Y.2d  [sic]    C. Matrimonial Actions    Section 235 of the Domestic Relations Law provides that neither an  officer of the court with whom the proceedings in a matrimonial action  or a written agreement of separation is filed or an action or  proceeding for custody, visitation or maintenance of a child are  filed, or before whom testimony is taken, or his clerk, either before  or after termination of the suit shall not permit a copy of any  pleadings, affidavits, findings of fact, conclusions of law, judgment  of dissolution, written agreement of separation or memorandum thereof,  or examination to be taken by any person other than a party, or the  attorney or counsel of a party, except by order of the court.    D, Confidential Records Records contained in a court file that are  deemed confidential may not be disclosed absent a court order  including the following: . . .    ? Court records in sex offense cases that might identify the victim.  See Civil Rights Law 50-b.    ? Mental health records, including records of commitment, retention  and discharge proceedings of the mentally ill and mentally retarded  (see Articles 9 and 15 of the Mental Hygiene Law; CPL 330.20) and  clinical records submitted in connection with the proceedings (see  Mental Hygiene Law 33.13[c]). . . .    ? Records of adoption proceedings. See Judiciary Law 90.10.    ? Other records or documents that have been sealed or designated  confidential by the court.I am not completely clear on the extent to which the case name itself is suppressed, as opposed to merely the contents of the case file in some of these situations, but where the name of a child is suppressed due to confidentiality this often extends to the name used in the caption and indexing of a court case that is available to lawyers not involved in the case and the general public.A court official would have authority to look at the information, but probably wouldn't be allowed to disclose it to you in any situation where you or a random lawyer was not allowed to do so, for the reasons set forth above.I can imagine circumstances in which the police or the prosecutor's office would be allowed to review sealed juvenile custody case records in furtherance of a criminal prosecution or potential criminal prosecution, but I couldn't tell you how they would go about getting that authorization as I have never practiced criminal law and am not familiar with that level of procedural detail in New York State. But, it is hard to imagine law enforcement coming to your aid in the circumstances you describe, although without knowing the reason that you want to locate person B, it is hard to know for sure."}

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not aninfringement of copyright for an authorized entity to reproduce or todistribute in the United States copies or phonorecords of apreviously published literary work or of a previously publishedmusical work that has been fixed in the form of text or notation ifsuch copies or phonorecords are reproduced or distributed inaccessible formats exclusively for use by eligible persons.(b)(1) Copies or phonorecords to which this section applies shall-(A) not be reproduced or distributed in the United States in a formatother than an accessible format exclusively for use by eligiblepersons;(B) bear a notice that any further reproduction or distribution in aformat other than an accessible format is an infringement; and(C) include a copyright notice identifying the copyright owner and thedate of the original publication.The way I understand it:copies of a literary workmeaning books, training materials, periodicals, etc. transcribed and distributed in Braille, for examplephonorecords of a literary workwhich would be a sound recording of a published (as in printed) literary work distributed on a medium only used by eligible people. For example, newspaper and magazine articles recorded by volunteers for an audio\/radio reading service (such as the  at the Braille Institute)Based on the above, this is how I would interpret the following scenarios:1. NPR article accompanied by the audio versionThe article itself is a literary work so I assume going ahead with that would be ok, but the audio is a sound recording and thus121 does not apply.2. Commercial audiobooksDistributing this would be a no-no, because it is a sound recording (and not a copy or a phonorecord of a literary work), but converting the source literary work would be okay, I guess.Or, distribution would be alright if the copyright owner provides explicit permission to do so. (The way .)3. Work is registered as a sound recording, with an underlying literary workDoes this mean that if, for example, a training material includes text and audio, and is registered as audio recording, then121 would not apply?Is this scenario the same as 1. above?AppendixSound recordings including underlying workWhen to Use Form SR (Sound Recordings) Use Form SR for registration of published or unpublished sound recordings, that is,for registration of the particular sounds or recorded performance.Form SR must also be used if you wish to make one registration forboth the sound recording and the underlying work (the musicalcomposition, dramatic, or literary work). You may make a singleregistration only if the copyright claimant is the same for both thesound recording and the underlying work. In this case, the authorshipstatement in Space 2 should specify that the claim covers both works.Form SR is also the appropriate form for registration of a multimediakit that combines two or more kinds of authorship including a soundrecording (such as a kit containing a book and an audiocassette).Sound Recording Select Sound Recording if you are registering a sound recording. Also, select Sound Recording if you are registeringboth a sound recording and the underlying musical, dramatic, orliterary work(s) that is embodied in that recording. Note: To registerboth the sound recording and the work embodied in that recording onone application, the copyright claimant must own all rights in bothworks.Note: Under the copyright law, the sounds that accompany a motionpicture or other audiovisual work are not considered a soundrecording. Select Motion Picture\/Audiovisual as the Type of Work toregister the sounds accompanying a motion picture or an audiovisualwork.Definitions according to )\"Phonorecords\" are material objects in which sounds, other than thoseaccompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work, are fixed byany method now known or later developed, and from which the sounds canbe perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directlyor with the aid of a machine or device. The term \"phonorecords\"includes the material object in which the sounds are first fixed.\"Sound recordings\" are works that result from the fixation of a seriesof musical, spoken, or other sounds, but not including the soundsaccompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work, regardless ofthe nature of the material objects, such as disks, tapes, or otherphonorecords, in which they are embodied.\"Literary works\" are works, other than audiovisual works, expressed inwords, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia,regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books,periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards,in which they are embodied.","answer":"The crucial term here is the last words of 121: exclusively for use by eligible persons. The created piece must be for the exclusive use of the disabled. For example, a Braile transcription is rather easily in that exception, as it is almost illegible for the vast majority of seeing people, and only needs to come in a box that has the needed stickers of the original copyright and that one may not copy or re-convert.Another thing that this applies to is phonorecords. These are physical items that carry audio in a way that it can be reproduced by a machine. Typically in these days those are CDs, Cassettes, or Vinyl, but in the past,  have been used as phonorecords. It's unclear if a flash drive could be a phonorecord, but I tend towards &quot;no, unless it is a Read-Only-Memory&quot;.As you observed, that exception only provides for phonorecords and copies, not the actual audio or digital files. This might be an old remnant, but it requires that a copy for the disabled has a physical manifestation that may not be copied again and only is to be given to eligible people. A file on a computer does not satisfy these rules. The Radio program for the disabled uses a different exception.So for a textbook with audio to comply, it has to come in a physical manner and with the files on a labeled phonorecord that contains the prescribed labeling for &quot;Do not copy&quot; and the original copyright."}

It's installation is visible to user and again like a regular software, it asks user to accept its End-user License Agreement.Everyday, we all install softwares to our computers but none of us actually read that seven page long and legalized agreement. We all just accept that without reading it to enable installation process. I see a great opportunity for malicious guys here. Someone create an adware or some kind of spyware, maybe a botnet client, and publish it as a regular software or maybe embed it to a software itself. That guy writes a complete detailed EULA that explains what that virus can do (send some data to third-parties), what virus allowed to do (download and run its so called 'updates'), what virus won't do and adds its disclaimer says any damage that this system or data take is something that software is not responsible.Can a spyware or a virus act legally with EULA?Is this a valid against court of law? Can a virus harm our computers and costs us money and effort, or just send our computer data to third-parties, is this agreement restricts us to sue that software or its owner and make this actions legal? Are parental control softwares, observation systems and remote access softwares do something like this?","answer":"An EULA, or 'End User License Agreement', is a contract between the software user and the software publisher. It usually protects the interest of the software publisher, e.g. you can only use it on one computer; you may not alter it or distribute it without written agreement etc.In this case, the EULA specifies that:The software may be harmful to the user's computerThe user's personal data may be sent to third partiesThe software may used to aid or perform illegal activitiesThe software publisher is not responsible for any damage caused by using this softwareFirst thing first, is this a valid contract? Let's take a look at the essential elements of a contract:Offer and AcceptanceIntentionConsiderationCapacityConsentLegalityPossibility of performanceThe Legality element specifies that the contract must not be something disapproved by law. Botnets are used for attacking other computers, i.e. an unlawful act. Installing botnets may violate the  in the UK.Sharing user's personal data may also violate data privacy laws.Let us, for the moment, assume the contract is valid. Item number 4 still causes a problem: an overly broad liability waiver. While liability waivers are common and normal, one can argue that the said waiver in this case seems to cover intentional or reckless acts. Such items in a contract are deemed as unenforceable.Parental control systems and remote observation systems are different. They can be used legally, and this legal use is common. Thus, distribution of these systems is legal. Needless to say, it is very difficult to argue that virus and botnets share the same. Of course, one can still use a remote observation system in an illegal way. In this case, the software user is liable, but the software publisher is not liable because the user's behavior is beyond their control."}

{"question":"Or can I just claim that any fabric is moisture-wicking? Could I sell a garment advertising that it wicks moisture into outer-space, using technology developed by astronauts? While protecting the wearer from plagues and earthquakes? And neutralizing armpit odor using anti-rot nano-particles?In the US? Worldwide?I was going to ask this on Skeptics and I'm still not sure where it belongs.I'm wondering why sports and outdoor equipment stores sell garments that advertise themselves as 'moisture-wicking' when clearly they are made of wool or some synthetic material which, as far as I understand it, is less absorbent and therefore less liable to act like a 'wick' via capillary action, than cotton, which is often a cheaper low-tech alternative. Seemingly this advertising myth has become quite entrenched in popular culture, I hear it cited by people all the time.On the face of it these claims are literally true, in that all fabrics absorb moisture to some extent. However, there seems to be an implication that a fabric advertised as 'moisture-wicking' will have a superior 'wicking' ability to a cheaper and older 'standard' fabric technology like cotton, and sometimes this superiority is an explicit part of the advertising on the label. Also, many such garments additionally claim to 'wick moisture away from the skin' which would seem to imply some kind of violation of the second law of thermodynamics or conservation of energy, or at least to contradict the plain observation that the fabric is the same on the inside and outside and contains no directional asymmetry.Are these claims governed by law? Do manufacturers only refrain from making more outlandish claims, like the examples I gave above, because then people would stop being so gullible? When does the FDA step in, for example if the purpose of having a 'moisture-wicking' garment is to protect the wearer from catching a cold after exercise, could this claim be part of the labeling?","answer":"Many U.S. Laws Govern Claims Made About Consumer ProductsAre these claims governed by law?The  that allows competitors of a merchant who are harmed by false advertising claims of that merchant to sue the merchant in federal court.The  also has broad consumer protection authority at the federal level that could be pertinent to this issue.Most states also have consumer protection laws that prohibit merchants from making false claims that can be enforced by the attorney-general's office, consumers harmed by the false claims in ordinary civil actions, and in class action lawsuits. In , whose consumer protection laws are particularly broad, a suit can be brought based upon the harm caused by the false advertisement itself, rather than merely based upon the harm that results from someone being actually mislead by the false advertisement.In addition, misrepresentations regarding products causing harm to someone who buys the products can give rise to common law lawsuits for  as an express warranty.In some contexts, federal criminal charges for  could also be brought.There is also a large body of law governing &quot; would probably not have jurisdiction over claims of false advertising related to a product that is not otherwise likely to cause physical harm when used as intended, even if it doesn't live up to representations made about the product.Furthermore, if a firm with passive investors (even if the company is , both civil and criminal. If the investors lost money when this knowing lack of disclosure became clear, they would have securities fraud claims against the companies involved.As to &quot;the world&quot; that is too broad a question for one answer. There are hundreds of countries in the world and an examination of all of their laws is simply too much.When does the FDA step in, for example if the purpose of having a&quot;moisture-wicking&quot; garment is to protect the wearer from catching acold after exercise, could this claim be part of the labeling?FDA jurisdiction is primarily over food and drugs (as the name, the &quot;&quot; suggests).While FDA jurisdiction does extend also to &quot;,&quot; it is unlikely that the FDA would consider claims related to ordinary clothing, even with allegedly premium fabrics which are claimed to have special properties, to fall under their jurisdiction.The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is the branch ofthe FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all medical devices,as well as overseeing the manufacturing, performance and safety ofthese devices. The definition of a medical device is given in <a href='https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>the FD&amp;CAct<\/a>, and it includes products from the simple toothbrush to complexdevices such as implantable neurostimulators. CDRH also oversees thesafety performance of non-medical devices that emit certain types ofelectromagnetic radiation. Examples of CDRH-regulated devices includecellular phones, airport baggage screening equipment, televisionreceivers, microwave ovens, tanning booths, and laser products.CDRH regulatory powers include the authority to require certaintechnical reports from the manufacturers or importers of regulatedproducts, to require that radiation-emitting products meet mandatorysafety performance standards, to declare regulated products defective,and to order the recall of defective or noncompliant products. CDRHalso conducts limited amounts of direct product testing.The FDA does not have jurisdiction over everything that is the subject of health claims, only food, drugs and medical devices.For example, even if a jump rope advertisement claimed that jumping rope improves cardiovascular health and reduces obesity, this would not bring the jump rope under FDA jurisdiction. This is true even if the claims were false (e.g. &quot;using a jump rope will cure Stage 4 pancreatic cancer in 9 out of 10 cases&quot;). These claims might violated other laws, but the FDA would not have jurisdiction over these claims.Do manufacturers only refrain from making more outlandish claims, likethe examples I gave above, because then people would stop being sogullible?Manufacturers (or more accurately the people who market manufactured goods to the retail public, who are often not manufacturers themselves), generally do not make advertisements that they know to be provably false, but in the particular example that you cite of moisture-wicking fabrics, I do not believe that the people involved (who, after all, went into marketing because STEM wasn't their thing) believe these representations to be false, or have any inkling that they might be false.I am not aware of any serious effort by any consumer protection oriented group to claim that these representations are false.Could I sell a garment advertising that it wicks moisture intoouter-space, using technology developed by astronauts? Whileprotecting the wearer from plagues and earthquakes?These claims would probably be interpreted as being made &quot;in jest&quot; rather than being made with an intent that they be believed and relied upon. There is no ban on  in commercial advertising.And neutralizing armpit odor using anti-rot nano-particles?I am pretty sure that there are . I have no reason to think that there is a belief on the part of the people making the claim that it is a false claim, or that anyone has established that these claims are false.Are Claims To Be Moisture-Wicking Misleading?I'm wondering why sports and outdoor equipment stores sell garmentsthat advertise themselves as &quot;moisture-wicking&quot; when clearly they aremade of wool or some synthetic material which, as far as I understandit, is less absorbent and therefore less liable to act like a &quot;wick&quot;via capillary action, than cotton, which is often a cheaper low-techalternative. Seemingly this advertising myth has become quiteentrenched in popular culture, I hear it cited by people all the time.. . .Also, many such garments additionally claim to &quot;wick moisture awayfrom the skin&quot; which would seem to imply some kind of violation of thesecond law of thermodynamics or conservation of energy, or at least tocontradict the plain observation that the fabric is the same on theinside and outside and contains no directional asymmetry.This sounds like an ill founded and inaccurate assessment of the practical reality and relevant science, but this portion of the question really is beyond the scope of Law and more relevant to Skeptics.In a lawsuit invoking some of the laws that I mentioned above, the allegation that these claims are misleading would have to be established by a preponderance of the evidence with expert testimony in a trial.Also, in the context of commercial speech, while the First Amendment does not prohibit regulation of false statements, it does disfavor making courts the final adjudicator of claims when the reality is hotly disputed and no specialized expert regulator is reviewing the claims.So, it would probably be sufficient to defeat a lawsuit alleging a misleading claim, to establish that legitimate authoritative sources with a scientific basis for their claims hold that the claim is accurate, even if other legitimate authoritative sources with a scientific basis for their claims disagree.Normally, a court would not impose liability if there was a dispute of authority of this kind, unless their was a claim that experts unanimously agree that the claim is false (hence, advertisements in the form &quot;9 out of 10 surveyed dentists agree that . . . &quot;)."}
{"question":"My companies NDA has this lineIndividuals shall not, directly or indirectly, disseminate, make  available, disclose, or use any reason other than performance of their  job with the Company, any confidential information or proprietary data  of the Company, unless and only to the extent such release or  disclosure is required by any court or administrative agency (and then  only after prompt notice to the Company to permit the Company to seek  a protective order).I can't help but think what that part in parenthesis means. If I were to for whatever reason be in court as a witness testifying against my employer, based on the NDA it sounds like any time a lawyer asked a question I'd have to defer to the my company to object to the question per the wording of the NDA. Similarly if I were subpoenaed for information regarding my company, I'd have to bring my employers lawyer along.Is this a correct interpretation?(It should be noted, this scenarios are theoretical, I don't know of anything I might get subpoenaed about)","answer":"The parenthesized part means that if you are being compelled by law to disclose some confidential information, you must promptly notify the company of that fact. They could they respond by trying to get you excluded as a witness, or to limit your testimony, but you don't have to care what they do once they've been notified that you were subpoenaed. It may well be that every time the opposing side asks you a question, 'your' side will object, and the judge will decide whether to sustain or overrule the objection. The only way in which you would defer to the company lawyer is by not answering the question before the question is finished (i.e. give the attorney 2 seconds to voice an objection).You would not have to 'bring' the employer's lawyer along to a deposition, but that lawyer would probably be present and would similarly raise objections, if he felt like it. Your duty is simply to tell the company that you are being compelled to testify.In case the police or a detective agency are investigating the matter and they come to interview you, you are not compelled by law to answer (or to hand over documents), therefore you are supposed to decline to answer (and you are not obligated to inform the company that someone asked a question). As for an administrative subpoena, the perhaps tricky part will be knowing whether you are being compelled to testify, or invited to testify. The wording of the paperwork should inform you whether this is compulsory."}

IANAL and appreciate a simple explanation followed by a technical narrative.UPDATES:1\/18\/21: ","answer":"Absolute ImmunityA President has absolute immunity from civil liability for his official acts. As discussed  (citations omitted):Although the President is sued daily in his governmental capacity, henormally is not sued in his personal capacity, which would hold himpersonally liable. In 1982, the Supreme Court held in Nixon v.Fitzgerald that the President enjoys absolute immunity from civillitigation for official acts undertaken while he or she is President.The Court suggested that this immunity was broad (though notlimitless), applying to acts within the &quot;outer perimeter'&quot; of thePresident's official duties. Fifteen years after Fitzgerald, theSupreme Court held in Clinton v. Jones that the President does notpossess absolute immunity from civil litigation surrounding acts hetook before becoming President. The 2020 Supreme Court decision inTrump v. Vance held that the president is subject to subpoenas in criminal prosecutions for personal conduct with the same legalthreshold as anyone else.So, one of the first legal issues that a court would have to confront is whether the acts in question were within the scope of the President's official acts and duties. If so, there is immunity. If this act is determined by the Court to be a private act of the President or ultra vires (beyond a reasonable view of the scope of his official duties), then absolute immunity would not apply.This would be analogous to the case of Carroll v. Trump (discussed, for example ) in which Carroll was allegedly defamed by statements made by Trump in an unofficial capacity and his civil action for defamation against Trump was, at least at some stages, allowed to proceed because it was outside the scope of Presidential absolute immunity.On October 26, 2020, the trial court in the Carroll v. Trump case  in the linked opinion, that Presidential absolute immunity did not apply to that claim.The analysis would be much less clear, although it might come up the same way, in a wrongful death case brought by Sicknick's next of kin as authorized by statute (presumably on a common law claim for assault resulting in a wrongful death, or for civil conspiracy to commit an assault resulting a wrongful death). This is because, unlike Carroll which pertained to statements made by Trump about Trump's pre-Presidential conduct, Sicknick would pertain the conduct by Trump while President, in relation to a federal election in which he was a Presidential candidate while holding Presidential office, and the actions that he urged the Capitol rioters to take to respond to the imminent Congressional certification of the results of that election which he claimed (without any factual basis and after having had the claim rejected by approximately five dozen courts) was fraudulently obtained.Qualified ImmunityQualified immunity is a doctrine to liability arising under 42 U.S.C. 1983, which authorizes civil actions for violations of constitutional rights. There is 1983 liability only when someone intentionally deprives another of their constitutional rights under color of law, and causes injury thereby. Qualified immunity states the principle that even if there is a deprivation of constitutional rights, a government official has liability only if the right is clearly established under applicable law.The key issue in this claim would be whether the President's actions were made &quot;under color of law&quot; and\/or whether they resulted in a deprivation of rights &quot;under color of law&quot;.The answer in this case is probably &quot;no.&quot; The people who caused Officer Brian Sicknick to suffer injuries in January 6, 2021 incident at the Capitol building that caused his death were not purporting to acts in furtherance of authority granted to them by the U.S. government or any other legitimate government, so this was not a civil rights violation, even though it may have been tortious conduct.Criminal LiabilityAny criminal sanction would have to arise either under federal law (sedition would be the obvious charge) or perhaps under D.C.'s penal code (solicitation of murder, or conspiracy to commit murder would be possible charges).In general, immunity from criminal charges would probably be subjected to a similar absolute immunity analysis, although there is very little case law on point because there are almost no examples of Presidents or former Presidents facing federal criminal charges (although Nixon v. Fitzgerald and Trump v. Vance come close, although Trump v. Vance is complicated by that fact that it involves state law criminal charges).In particular, the U.S. Supreme Court in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, the Court emphasized in dicta in its 5-4 decision that the President is not immune from criminal charges stemming from his official or unofficial acts while he is in office. But certainly acts that would be criminal if authorized by someone else, like ordering the CIA to attempt to kill a suspected terrorist, which are without the scope of the President's official acts, would not give rise to criminal liability, so this dicta is something of an overstatement.One could argue, however, that in a case like that one (and most acts that would otherwise constitute crimes that are legal when authorized by the President), there is not governmental immunity from criminal liability, and that there is instead a &quot;justification&quot; for the otherwise criminal act that is a non-immunity based exception to criminal liability similar to the basis upon which a police officer has an affirmative justified use of force defense to a murder charge when he used force authorized by law to make prevent a crime or stop a violent felony who is a danger to the public from escaping.If the immunity analysis is correct, then there is criminal liability if this act is determined by the Court to be a private act of the President or ultra vires (beyond a reasonable view of the scope of his official duties), a criminal prosecution could proceed, and this question would be resolved by the judge in a pre-trial hearing.If the &quot;justification&quot; rather than the immunity analysis is correct, then the question would be whether there was any legalized justification under the law for the acts alleged to amount to criminal conduct that the President was charged with in the indictment, either on the face of the indictment, if the facts alleged there are clear enough (in which case it could be resolved by a judge in a pre-trial hearing) or as applied to the specific facts of the case (in which case the question of justification would be resolved by the jury at trial). It is not obvious what common law or statutory theory could justify the acts alleged.If there was no valid affirmative defense of legal justification to the charges, and the Courts held that there was no such thing as absolute immunity from criminal prosecutions for official acts, then the core of the criminal case would focus on proving the statutory elements of the charges brought and overcoming the First Amendment affirmative defense discussed below.An analysis of some of the pertinent murder charges can be found in , again, without the additional lawyers of immunity analysis.As a practical matter and as a matter of Justice Department policy, a President may not be prosecuted for federal crimes while in office. But that isn't a bar to criminal prosecution of a President for actions taken by the President outside of his official duties while in office (or alternately, because there is no lawful justification for his actions).For example, if the President assaulted his wife in a domestic violence incident that took place in the White House, he could be prosecuted for that crime by the D.C. prosecutor at any time after his term of office expired but before the statute of limitations had run.The President could in theory also be prosecuted for this conduct if absolute immunity did not apply (or does not exist as a matter of law for criminal conduct, a question is has not authoritatively been resolved although persuasive authority from other cases suggests that it may not). No one could compel either federal or D.C. prosecutors to do so, however. Any such prosecution would be in the sole discretion of the pertinent prosecutors.Further, since these would be felony prosecutions under federal law (D.C. law is also a special subset of federal law), the prosecutions could only be brought pursuant to a grand jury convened either by a Justice Department attorney in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, or by a District of Columbia government appointed prosecutor in the Criminal Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.In either case, however, both the grand jury whose approval would be required to indict Trump, and the petite jury trying the case on the merits, would be drawn from the District of Columbia, which is pretty much the least favorable jury pool that Donald Trump could imagine. There is no state in the United States where a larger share of the Presidential election was cast against Donald Trump than in the District of Columbia.Of course, criminal liability primarily imposed a sentence of incarceration (or probation) and\/or a fine and court costs, and restitution, only the last of which would benefit Sicknick's survivors. But the measure of recovery in a restitution award is much more narrow than the measure of damages in a civil action in tort (i.e. for a civil wrong).The criminal counterpart to 42 U.S.C. 1983 for civil liability under federal law is 18 USC 242, but that would not apply to this case either for the same reason. The people who carried out the assault were not acting under color of law.Immunity from state law prosecutions is discussed in another answer citing a 2003 *Yale Law Journal article (starting on page 2195) &quot;What Kind of Immunity? Federal Officers, State Criminal Law, and the Supremacy Clause by Seth P. Waxman and Trevor W. Morrison, which is on point. But since the incident at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 took place outside of any U.S. state, the federalism and Supremacy Clause issues raised in that article which involve a different facet of immunity from prosecution rather than Presidential absolute immunity for official actions considerations, this analysis has no application to this particular fact pattern.Collateral estoppelA doctrine called collateral estoppel also known as issue preclusion makes certain legal determinations made in one proceeding binding against the person against whom they were decided in future legal proceedings. But this does not apply to determinations of Congress regarding impeachment.The U.S. House of Representatives, in a bipartisan majority vote, expressed the opinion that President Trump's conduct constitutes a &quot;high crime or misdemeanor&quot; justifying his impeachment. This week, as I write, the U.S. Senate is conducting an impeachment trial to determine if President Trump shall be convicted of the conduct for which he has been impeached and so, if he should be barred from holding future public office as a result, which requires a two-thirds majority of the Senate.The U.S. Constitution expressly provides, however, that a finding of Congress on the question of impeachment is not binding upon the criminal courts or civil court and is limited to removal from office, dishonor and eligibility to hold public offices in the future.If Congress purported to try to hold President Trump liable criminally for this conduct, outside the impeachment process, this would be an unconstitutional Bill of Attainder.A civil case would also not be collateral estoppel as to the criminal case (where a different and higher burden of proof applies).But a conviction obtained in a criminal prosecution would constitute collateral estoppel against Trump in a civil prosecution brought against Trump assuming that the civil case was brought within the applicable statute of limitations and the criminal case was resolved of the merits first. So, a criminal conviction could make it much easier to secure civil liability, albeit only through the indirect means of the collateral estoppel doctrine.First Amendment considerationsAnother answer correctly notes that on the merits of either a civil lawsuit or a criminal case, that Brandenberg v Ohio sets a high bar of First Amendment protection in incitement cases. Strictly speaking, that is an element of the underlying merits of the civil claim or criminal charges, however, and not a question of governmental immunity. One doesn't get to the merits or the First Amendment affirmative defenses at all in the analysis unless one can first overcome the governmental immunity hurdles that are presented."}

{"question":"I have a scamming property management where I'm renting a studio apartment with.  I'm in Illinois, US. I have many issues with them. For instance, when I was renting with them, as soon as they got my signature, they give me a utility bill left from previous tenants, asking me to pay. I resisted saying like utilities, bills should be charged to whoever using them. But they said we bill to the apartment, not people. They also had workers changing electricity switch boxes in my apartment, make my lockers and others unusable for more than a month. Cockroaches and insects everywhere in the kitchen. I noticed they made an unauthorized payment on my account for more than a monthly payment! No one except them has the portal's account. Fortunately I realized this quickly and canceled the transaction.But the one I can not tolerate anymore is that I purchased my own rental insurance at the time of moving, and simply asked them to waive their own insurance fee. They did it a month later, but I noticed surprisingly my gas fee suddenly became 4x higher, so the total sum is remaining the same! One day I got a utility bill from a neighbor with a 2BR of 2x sq ft, and noticed while many of my charges are half (due to half sq ft), some others like gas fee are more than half! In fact, the sum of difference is that insurance fee which was supposed to be waived!!Due to these obvious reasons, I definitely want to move out of the place. But how should I handle the contract which is still up for 4 months? That contract needs to be stopped.","answer":"If you just walk away, it is possible that they will sue you for the remaining rent. Then you would need to defend yourself in court, for which you would need a lawyer. So the simplest thing to do is take the legal high ground and sue the landlord.

{"question":"If a developer writes a program, for example a password cracker or a code decipher, and it is used illegally, will the developer or the user get punished? A password cracker could be used, for example, if you forgot your email password, and that is perfectly legal. But you could also use the password cracker to hack into someone else's account. Same deal for a code decipher (it could be used legally or illegally.) So my question is: if a user uses a program illegally, is the user or the developer punished? Is there something a developer can do (like put a user agreement that states you should not use it illegally?)","answer":"The simple answer is yes. There's a famous case that illustrates this: A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (2001).A number of record companies successfully sued Napster for infringing their various intellectual property rights.Essentially, the finding came down to the fact that:Napster's program (of the same name) allows for the exchange of copyrighted material, and Napster had actual knowledge that specific infringing material was available using its system, and that it did not remote the material (by blocking access to the system or otherwise).Napster did not police the index of files that they maintained, and so were liable for vicarious infringement.The longer answer to your question is it depends. Based on the Napster precedent, it seems it would depend (at least) on whether:   the program may have legitimate uses  you are aware that it can be used for illegal purpose  you have a means of monitoring the activity  you have a means of restricting use of the program  you financially benefit from the activities of the usersMany developers will include some warning about using the software only for legal purposes.

{"question":"It's been the news in the Trump-leaning  that Georgia's RULE 183-1-14-0.6-.14 Secure Absentee Ballot Drop Boxes had expired prior to the Nov election, allegedly because no such emergency rule can be valid for more than 120 days and it was last adopted\/modified on Jun 1st.Under Georgia law, emergency rules adopted by any state agency or regulatory body automatically expire 120 days after their adoption(see 50-13-4-b).On the other hand, I've seen mentioned in the press twice that that rule was valid for a bit more, approximately 6 months. This was  in relation to both the June 1 modification\/extension:Processing absentee ballots- Some of the changes we're making are getting rid of reference to June 9.

To make it permanent we would have to go over the rule making process which I envision us doing.and in relation to the Nov 23 .Drop boxes will remain stationed at county elections offices and certain polling locations. Registered voters are able to avoid in-person interaction and mailing in their ballots if they use the drop box associated with their county. The board extended this rule to February 5, falling short of the six-month emergency rule provision.So, who is right here? Can the Board only issue emergency rules valid for max 120 days? Or up to 6 months? What would be the legal basis of the latter?I'll note that in  to a lawsuit (on another matter--the Prompt Notification Rule [for absentee ballot rejections] 183-1-14-.13), Georgia'sAttorney General's office recognizes that 50-13 applies to (at least some) rules issued by the state election board:The Georgia Administrative Procedure Act, O.C.G.A.\u00a7 50-13-1 through50-13-44, specifically provides a framework for the General Assembly to reviewand acquiesce in the rules promulgated by regulatory bodies such as the StateElection Board.So, the question is then one of interpretation of those provisions, I suppose.","answer":"According to the  on emergency rules:The rule may be effective for a period of not longer than 120 days but the adoption of an identical rule under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this Code section is not precluded; provided, however, that such a rule adopted pursuant to discharge of responsibility under an executive order declaring a state of emergency or disaster exists as a result of a public health emergency, as defined in Code Section 38-3-3, shall be effective for the duration of the emergency or disaster and for a period of not more than 120 days thereafter.The second half of this looks a little ambiguous to me. When it says &quot;such a rule&quot;, is it referring to the emergency rule, or to the &quot;identical rule&quot;?I believe it's probably referring to the emergency rule, in which case the rule could be effective for at most 120 days after the expiration of the emergency, rather than 120 days total."}

It is their unremitting obligation to respond tosubpoenas, to respect the dignity of the Congress and its committees,and to testify fully with respect to matters within the province ofproper investigation. This, of course, assumes that the constitutionalrights of witnesses will be respected by the Congress as they are in acourt of justice.

They cannot be subjected tounreasonable search and seizure. Nor can the First Amendment freedomsof speech, press, religion, or political belief and association beabridged.Congress has the power to enact laws (and it not charged with the duty to investigate federal crimes, which is in the domain of the executive branch). So if Congress wants to find out whether they should pass a law, they can subpoena people and ask them questions.In the case of Watkins, an individual was interrogated regarding his personal life. He refused to answer, stating that &quot;I do not believe that such questions are relevant to the work of this committee nor do I believe that this committee has the right to undertake the public exposure of persons because of their past activities&quot;. The Supreme Court concluded that while it is an offense to refuse to answer questions &quot;pertinent to the question under inquiry&quot;, the Court could not figure out with reasonable certainty what the inquiry was about. BTW the holdings section of this opinion (in 1957) ranges a-y, which is a remarkably nuanced and non-committal collection of holdings, which can be summarized by saying that the court found the question to likely be &quot;off-topic&quot;.If Congress wants to contemplate passing a law to restrict Twitter, it can subpoena anyone it wants to.

{"question":"I had some questions about how jury selection works upon reading  that was shared to Facebook:A couple of years ago I got called for jury duty and made it through  a couple of rounds of dismissals before the remaining candidates were  led into a room to meet the judge and defense attorney.It was an assault casea drunk man had assaulted a woman friend of his  outside of a nightclub.There were 30 potential jurors in the room, 12 were women. The first  question the defense attorney asked of the women in the room was this:  'Have you ever been assaulted by a man?' All 12 women in the room said yesand were asked to publicly describe  the abuse. Right there, in front of everyone. All 12 women were  dismissed from the pool of potential jurors. Not a single woman was  eligible to be on that jurywe could not be deemed 'impartial' because  of each woman's individual history of being abused by men.I think about that case a lot and wonder if any of the men were asked  if they had ever assaulted anyone. And more and more I see what 'a  jury of peers' really means in this societyabusive men excusing the  behavior of other abusive men.Basically, I wonder how often the jury selection happens like it was described in that story. Specifically, my questions are:How often are jury members subject to separate examination by defense counsel (or prosecution counsel) during jury selection?How frequently are jury members dismissed in the presence of other members?Alternatively, how often are dismissed jury members informed of the selection or elimination of fellow jury members?Is the defense counsel able to eliminate (all twelve) jury members from consideration (for cause) without objections by prosecution counsel?","answer":"Short AnswerThis account would be a fairly extreme outlier relative to normal practice in jury selection, but it is certainly something that could possibly happen (except for one small detail that isn't very relevant to the core issues that it raises; this detail is discussed below in the last heading of this answer).The substantive points made in the Facebook post about what the facts recounted say about the state of women's conditions and attitudes about women in our society, and the poster's skepticism that a judge who made decisions like these really acted appropriately, are well founded, fair, and appropriate to raise.

Further, in many states, judges are partisan elected officials who tend to end up in there positions because of, rather than in spite of, their extreme views and positions of legal issues over which they have discretion relative to the average lawyer or judges in places where the judicial selection process is less partisan.<h3>Your Questions<\/h3>How often are jury members subject to separate examination by defensecounsel (or prosecution counsel) during jury selection?This usually happens in any case more serious than a simple traffic offense. It would be unusual to examine every single member separately in a separate room, but normally quite a few jurors a questioned separately on one point or another. This process is called <i>voir dire<\/i> (a situation in which U.S. legal terminology borrows from French rather than Latin).How frequently are jury members dismissed in the presence of othermembers?Jury members are usually dismissed in the presence of other members, but the specific juror responses to the reasons for doing so may or may not be discussed in the presence of the other jurors. Less sensitive questions (e.g., do you still live in this county, are you a U.S. citizen, do you speak English, do you have scheduled health procedures during the anticipated trial or a trip with a non-refundable ticket or similar issue, and a few other &quot;categorical&quot; exclusions) are usually discussed in the presence of other members, as are responses to general questions that are unlikely to be grounds by themselves for a dismissal for cause, but could inform peremptory challeges of jurors.The better and more common practice is for sensitive questions, such as a previous incident of being assaulted, to be discussed out of earshot from the other panel members, but in the hearing of the judge, at least one lawyer for each side and the court reporter who includes the bench conference in the trial transcript.Alternatively, how often are dismissed jury members informed of theselection or elimination of fellow jury members?Normally, jury pool members leave the courtroom and get on with their day once they are dismissed. But, if they choose to stick around, they will learn who is selected to serve on the jury, and who is eliminated from the jury pool.Is the defense counsel able to eliminate (all twelve) jury membersfrom consideration (for cause) without objections by prosecutioncounsel?TerminologyFirst of all, here and in your prior questions it is important to distinguish between the jury pool (a group of randomly chosen people who might end up being jurors) and the jury (a group of people ultimately selected to decide a case after challenges for cause and peremptory challenges are complete).The Voir Dire ProcessThere is, in principle, no limit on the number of members of the jury pool who can be dismissed for cause, and if they run out, everyone goes home for the day and comes back the next day with a supplemental batch of jury pool members. In an obscure civil case or minor low profile felony case, the jury pool would typically be 30-60 potential jurors. In a death penalty case or case that has famous parties (e.g. a civil case involving Taylor Swift held in Denver recently), the jury pool would typically be several hundred people and the first round of voir dire would happen over the course of several days or even weeks.Any time that either party requests that a juror be dismissed for cause, the other party can choose to not object, or can object and argue that the juror should not be dismissed for cause.The judge doesn't have to dismiss a juror even when both parties agree to strike the juror for cause and not infrequently will refuse to dismiss a juror even when both parties agree to strike a juror for cause. This is because the judge has an institutional incentive to discourage jurors other than the one that a party has moved to dismiss from the jury pool from giving a lame excuse to try to get out of jury duty, even if the parties, who don't have that institutional concern, don't care about that.Why Might A Prosecutor Fail To Object?The downside of objecting to a request to dismiss a juror for cause is that it creates an almost automatic appellate issue for the party seeking to dismiss the juror if the juror is not dismissed.So, a prosecutor might not object to a questionable request to dismiss a juror for cause in order to reduce the likelihood that a conviction obtained by the prosecutor would be reversed on appeal. Giving the defense the jury it wants also makes it more likely that if the case starts going badly that the defendant will agree to a plea bargain mid-trial rather than risking a conviction by the jury, because any conviction obtained is more likely to hold up on appeal.A defendant may appeal a ruling denying a motion to dismiss a prospective juror that is denied after a conviction, if any, is entered.If the jury acquits the defendant (the unfavorable outcome the prosecutor would like to avoid by not having a juror dismissed for cause), the prosecutor can't appeal the case, and if the jury hears evidence, the case can't be dismissed without prejudice or retried unless there is a conviction that is reversed or there is a mistrial (the mistrial rules are bit complicated).So, if the prosecutor was really appalled by the dismissal for cause of so many women and felt that this would impair the prosecution's chance of obtaining a conviction materially, the prosecutor would have to dismiss the criminal charges so as to vacate the trial, before evidence was presented to the jury, and then refile the charges (assuming that this would be possible consistent with statutes of limitation and speedy trial requirements).But, this would be an extraordinary move with high stakes, because the prosecutor has a long term strategic interest in not pissing off a judge in any case because that could cause the judge to exercise the judge's discretion against the prosecutor in future cases. The judge and prosecutor may have to deal with each other in future cases for decades and will do so on a regular basis every few weeks or months.A judge is likely to be pissed off in this situation because dismissing a case ready to go to trial and scheduled for trial with a jury fully selected because the prosecutor was unhappy with the judge's rulings on motions to dismiss jurors for cause would not be appreciated by the judge who naturally believes that the rulings made on those motions were sound even if that belief is unreasonable.I strongly suspect that this was the reason that the prosecutor allowed all twelve women in the jury panel to be stricken for cause in the case that you describe (assuming, of course, that the Facebook account is factually accurate, which is sometimes the case and sometimes not the case \u2013 even if the gist of the account was accurate, it wouldn't be surprising if some technical details or nuances were incorrectly recounted).It Would Not Be Normal For A Prosecutor To Not Object In This CaseDespite these procedural considerations, it would be very unusual for a prosecutor to not object to striking all twelve women on a jury panel for cause in these circumstances and it would be very unusual for a judge to agree to strike all twelve women on the jury panel for cause in these circumstances whether or not the prosecutor objected.Generally speaking, merely having had a prior experience of having been assaulted would not be sufficient to strike a prospective juror for cause. Normally, the prosecutor and\/or the judge would ask the prospective juror if this experience made it impossible for that particular juror to be impartial in this particular case, and normally most of the prospective jurors asked that question would say &quot;no&quot;. Usually, in that situation, the judge would not agree to dismiss that prospective juror for cause.Most prosecutors would expect their objections to a request to dismiss a prospective juror for cause in this situation to be taken seriously by the judge and for only a few of these requests that cast the most doubt on the impartiality of a potential juror to be granted. And, most prosecutors would not consider the appellate risk involved in opposing a request to dismiss a prospective juror for cause in the typical scenario that I outlined above very troubling, because a judge has fairly broad discretion on dismissals of jurors for cause in the face of a marginal fact pattern.The fact that the judge allowed this also suggests that the prosecutor may know that the judge is very unenlightened and has misogynist leanings and that fighting the judge's ruling in this case would be a lost cause that is hard to appeal.(Of course, if any of the women had previously been assaulted by the defendant in this particular case and personally knew that defendant well, that would normally cause the potential juror to be dismissed for cause.)<h3>After Challenges For Cause<\/h3>Keep in mind also that after dismissals for cause are completed, a certain number of jurors equal to the number of peremptory challenges allowed to the prosecution and defense combined plus the number of jurors who need to be left over to decide the case would be put in the second stage of narrower jury pool. In this second stage, during which the narrower jury pool is honed to the actual final panel of jurors who will hear the case, each side exercises their allocated number of peremptory challenges (normally alternating back one forth, one juror at a time).While peremptory challenges can generally be made without good cause, you can not make a peremptory challenge solely based upon a potential juror's race or sex. If a side dismisses all women, or all men from the jury pool, there is a presumption that this is what was done by the party striking the jurors that must be overcome with convincing reasons not based on race or sex.The same analysis, strictly speaking, doesn't apply to motions to dismiss jurors for cause because in those cases a non-discriminatory reason has been definition been advanced by the party seeking to dismiss the prospective juror and accepted by the judge as convincing based upon the voir dire evidence.One reason not to fight very hard to dismiss a juror for cause is that many of those jurors who seem most favorably inclined to your case, although not necessarily all of them, are likely to end up being dismissed in a peremptory challenge in any case.<h3>A Footnote on Ex Parte Proceedings<\/h3>Ex Parte Voir Dire Is ImproperThe author of the OP also clarified that:When I asked, &quot;How often are jury members subject to separateexamination [\u2026]?&quot;, I meant that only one party (or counsel for oneparty) is examining the jury at a time. E.g., first the judge andprosecution counsel examines the jury (without defense present) thenthe judge and defense counsel examines the jury at some other time.Normally, the judge asks boilerplate routine questions first, then one side asks questions, then the other side asks questions.But, it would be almost unheard of (and it would be improper and unethical) for this to happen without lawyers for both sides present to see what transpires during the other side's questioning, even if the prosecution wasn't planning to make challenges for cause, so as to gather up information needed for the preemptory challenge phase of jury selection.To have a proceeding without both sides having a lawyer present is called an ex parte communication with the judge which both the judge and the lawyer doing so have an &quot;ethical&quot; duty to avoid in this part of the jury selection process.An ethical duty means that the judge could be, in theory, kicked of the bench or temporary suspended or public reprimanded or require to take a judicial ethics class for doing so; and that the lawyer could similarly be disbarred or suspended from the practice of law or publicly reprimanded or required to take a legal ethics class for doing so.Conducting the proceeding ex parte could also be grounds for a mistrial ruling that would not prevent the defendant from being retried (because it would have been done at the request of and for the benefit of the defense counsel), or for an appeal in the appropriate cases.(There are ex parte proceedings which are ethical and permitted such as applications for search warrants and arrest warrants, but juror selection is not a proceeding to which an exception to the general rule applies.)The Prosecution Could, In Theory, Waive The Right To ParticipateIn principle, the prosecutor could waive the right to be present while the judge and defense lawyer examine prospective jurors, but this would be almost bizarre conduct that would only happen if someone was calling about an incredibly urgent development that threatened to shut down the courts or put the prosecutor or co-workers or family at immediate risk of physical harm happened.For example, a prosecutor might waive a right to be present if the prosecutor wasn't planning on objecting to any jurors for cause and was learning that the 9-11 attacks were underway, or that a mass shooting at the prosecutor's offices had happened or was in progress, or a prosecutor having a spouse who the person they stepped out to talk with was in a newly discovered hostage situation, or the prosecutor suddenly feeling an intense need to vomit or being on the verge of passing out or feeling like a heart attack might be in progress.Even then, however, it would be more common for a judge to call a recess for a little while in any of those circumstances.The Case Description Is Probably Incorrect Or Misleading On This PointThe ex parte examination of prospective jurors, which was apparently described, would be so far outside the norm of typical jury selection conduct, that I suspect that this part of the account is inaccurate or was confusingly worded.For example, the post's wording arguably misleadingly implied that there was an ex parte proceeding as part of the jury selection process, but it wouldn't be necessarily inconsistent with a scenario in which a prosecutor was already present with the female jurors &quot;before the remaining candidates were led into a room to meet the judge and defense attorney.&quot;For example, it could be that what really happened was that a member of the prosecutors office was introduced to the in the jury assembly room, and led the prospective jurors to the correct courtroom without making any comments to them, and then they met the judge and defense counsel, which would be entirely proper and not unusual."}
{"question":"My brother was recently employed full time in a very specialized (and sensitive) job in South Africa for a company based in the US. There are less than 300 people in the world suited for his job.  His employer was so anxious to get him to sign the contract that things were rushed a little it seems. My brother signed the contract he had been given (already signed by the employer) and noticed that the salary they had agreed on per year, was stated in the contract as the salary per month.My brother, informed the employer and an amendment to the contract was signed.Due to the nature of the job, very advanced notice (minimum 6 months) is required by both parties for terminating the contract.What would the implications be if an employee were to refuse signing an amendment and insist on what was stated in the original signed contract, even if he\/she knows it's a mistake?","answer":"  What would the implications be if an employee were to refuse signing  an amendment and insist on what was stated in the original signed  contract, even if he\/she knows it's a mistake?The contract is voidable unless the employer's subsequent conduct reinforces its legitimacy. The employee's attempt to take advantage of something he knew was a mistake contravenes the covenant of good faith and fair dealing on which contracts are premised.  is not an exception to this:  The law of contract underpins private enterprise in South Africa and  regulates it in the interest of fair dealing.The employer can resort to records of prior communications between the parties to prove that the stated compensation was intended as yearly, not monthly.Even if those records are not available in a judicial dispute, the employee would have a hard time persuading a court that the salary that was agreed upon is 12 times --or exceeds by a factor of 12-- the market rate for a job position of similar type."}
{"question":"If I have a software license and somewhere in it states something to the effect of 'Only white people can use this software', is it legally binding in the United States?","answer":"A software license is a form of giving permission to a person to make a copy of copyrighted material. In this case, the license would be a contract, not a bare license (an open source license may be a bare license, assuming it grants all rights without assigning those rights). The problem is that copyright infringement is governed by federal law, and breach of contract is a state matter. The author gets two cracks at the matter, as copyright infringement, and as breach.There are federal laws against racial discrimination, passed under , which predates internet sales by decades. One might then think that Title II is irrelevant. If the software is sold in a store, that location is plainly a public accommodation, and Title II would render that clause illegal. So to continue the discussion, we have to assume that this was an internet sale.., 97 F. Supp. 3d 565 is a case of interest, involving discrimination for an internet-only business. Citing a wealth of prior cases that don't clearly decide the matter, that court found that the text of the law is insufficient, and other means must be called on to make the determination:  While no circuit court has directly addressed whether a website with  no physical retail outlet or building open to the public can be a  place of public accommodation under Title III, clearly there is more  than one reasonable interpretation of the language at issue here.  Therefore, the Court may go beyond the text and context of the text to  understand the statute's meaning.Canons of construction don't yield clarity either. The court found that legislative intent resolves the matter. The exact reasons are way too long and involved to summarize, but it comes down to distinguishing legislative intent in the case of the Civil Rights Act, versus the later ADA. Citing congressional committee reports, the court found that  It was 'critical' to define places of  more  broadly than the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because 'discrimination  against people with disabilities is not limited to specific categories  of public accommodations.''Public accommodation' has two different definitions, one (Civil Rights Act) pertaining to discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin, and the other (ADA) based on disability.There does not seem to be case law establishing that an internet-only sale is subject to the anti-discrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act, and some evidence that it is not. The case of , involving alleged religious discrimination in an online chat site, was dismissed for many reasons, one being:  Even assuming, arguendo, that plaintiff's Title II claim is not barred  by 230, it must nonetheless be dismissed for failure to state a  claim because AOL's chat rooms and other online services do not  constitute a 'place of public accommodation' under Title II....  Yet, as the relevant case law and an examination the statute's  exhaustive definition make clear, 'places of public accommodation' are  limited to actual, physical places and structures, and thus cannot  include chat rooms, which are not actual physical facilities but  instead are virtual forums for communication provided by AOL to its  members.A website where one could download software is even less of a public accommodation. So since there is no clear federal bar to racial discrimination in a software license, it is plausible that an infringement case could survive.It is not clear how the case would fare in state courts, since states often have even stricter anti-discrimination laws which could render that condition in the contract unenforceable. The clause might be deemed illegal on general 'public policy' grounds. If the contract (license) has a severability clause, the overall license should survive, just omitting the racial restriction. Without such a clause... if the contract is held to be void, the customer does not have permission to copy (which comes from the contract), and thus has infringed copyright law.Insofar as there is no serious question that the courts would find such a license to be repugnant, it is hard to imagine the courts saying 'but, by the letter of the law, this is allowed'. The most likely path for reaching that end is for a higher court to disregard a part of Noah and discover that internet sales fall within the category of public accommodation. This issue has not been clearly decided to the best of my knowledge, and it's not at all easy to compute the federal outcome based on statutory and case law."}
{"question":"What is a difference between Pro Se and Pro Per, in the United States legal system?From my understanding, both terms mean a party representing themselves.I read on :Pro Se is usually used in federal court.Pro Per is usually used in state court.If the statement is accurate, why, and is there any other difference?","answer":"Pro Se and Pro Per both means for oneself.

{"question":"I want to reuse a gif published in .

{"question":"So right now in my home state of Iowa, an undocumented immigrant is on trial for murder charges. Apparently he wasn't read his rights when he was being investigated.Whether that is true or not, does he have those same rights as a U.S. citizen?","answer":"Everyone physically present in the US is protected by the US   Federal constitution. (In some cases persons not physically in the US also have protection from the US constitution. When that applies is too complex for this answer.) Most of the rights protected by that constitution are available to anyone present, whether citizen, lawful immigrant, lawful visitor, or a person in the US without lawful authority. A few rights, such as the right to vote and to run for public office, are limited to citizens.If a person was arrested but not informed of his or her Miranda rights, then statements made to the arresting officers (or later interrogating officers) would not be admissible in court, unless an exception to the Miranda rules applies, which is unlikely. I can't say if this happened in the particular case mentioned in the question.In general, in the area of criminal procedure, there is no difference between citizens and others subject to US jurisdiction (accredited foreign diplomats normally have immunity). A few crimes can only be committed by citizens (or others owing allegiance to the US) such as treason. A few crimes, such as unlawful entry to the US, can't be committed by citizens, as citizens automatically have a right to enter. But criminal procedure and constitutional rights affecting criminal procedure, are the same for all in the US, citizen or not. (Oh, there are special laws for minors, but that isn't a matter of citizenship.)"}
{"question":"I am interested in creating and selling hardware for emulating old arcade games. However, I am very aware that there could be several legal issues here.First of all, many emulators are open-source, but have non-commercial licenses. Would it be legal to create a piece of hardware that would download and install the software upon the user's consent?If the above is legal, is it necessary to ask for user confirmation?Theoretical Software: RetroPie, which includes many non-commercially licensed components. All components are open-source.Location: United States","answer":"It is legal to sell hardware, but not legal to sell forbidden software even if burned into the hardware. The technical details of what you want to do are not clear (and irrelevant to this SE), but to state the matter more broadly, you can sell a computer, and you can sell a computer with software pre-installed (in some manner) if you have permission to do so, but not if the software come with a 'you can't sell this or any thing about it' kind of license. A user of such a computer could, however, install software that is quasi-open with a non-commercial exception, as long as their use is not commercial. If a user illegally installs software, you are not liable unless your device is specifically designed to download illegal software (as opposed to simply making it possible)."}
{"question":"I plan to go to an academic conference, and write down all questions from the audience I heard during the presentations. Then, I plan to make the list questions publicly available on Internet (without mentioning the name of the person who asked the question).Do I need to have attendees' agreement?The conference has no non-disclosure agreement, or similar confidentiality clause.","answer":"I can't think of any law which prevents you from repeating a presumably impromptu question that someone says publicly. It occurs to me that a person at an academic conference might argue that their strung together words are really cutting edge and therefore not to be repeated by anyone but themself, but then they shouldn't have spoken them in public. On the one hand, the very point of academic conferences is to share ideas. On the other, maybe people sharing ideas assume they are only sharing with fellow attendees, not with the entire internet!I think the problem is not a legal one, but a professional and interpersonal one. In other words, etiquette. Meaning that someone who does this won't end up in court, but might end up being mistrusted and disinvited from future events. Inasmuch as that's the case, proper etiquette will be dictated by those who travel in the social circle. "}
{"question":"A pastebin site, hosted in the US, allows users to post data anonymously. However, its intended purpose is for sharing information about one's computer, including the username (which is sometimes PII). Under GDPR, is the site owner required to allow users to delete posts, even though there's no way to verify who posted? What if all posts are automatically deleted after one day or some other period of time?","answer":"Yes, there would still be an obligation to comply with erasure requests \u2013 if the data subject can be identified, and if the GDPR applies.This is a case for Art 11 GDPR: processing which does not require identification.The pastebin site is not required to collect identifying info just in order to facilitate later deletion.If the site is unable to identify the data subjects, then the data subject rights (like access, rectification, erasure, restriction, or data portability) do not apply. Other rights like the right to be informed and the right to object do remain, though.But if the data subject provides sufficient additional information that makes it possible to identify their records, then the data subject rights apply again.In practice, this is likely going to mean that anyone with access to a paste will be able to request deletion, since the site would have no ability to verify the identity of the data subject beyond the information in the paste.None of this absolves the site from implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of this data. Even though the pastes might not be directly identifying, they are personal data and are far from anonymous. Common practices like numbering pastes with a sequential ID or showing recent pastes on a homepage have to be viewed critically. My go-to recommendation is to assign a cryptographically random UUIDv4 ID to the post, so that it is practically impossible for anyone to find the paste unless they were given a link by the uploader.Your idea to delete pastes after a fairly short retention period is also good. This helps with security, and it is in line with the GDPR's data minimization and storage limitation principles: data may only be kept as long as necessary for its purpose. On the other hand, quick deletion might not be in line with the purpose of these pastes \u2013 it all depends on context.You mention that this is an US-based site. If so, there's a question whether GDPR would even apply. GDPR will apply per Art 3(2) if the data controller is offering its services to people who are in Europe. Here, offering does not mean mere availability of the website, but that the data controller intends the service to be used by such people, in particular if the service is somehow targeted or marketed to such people."}
{"question":" mentions a U-Turn only once. In 20-140.3 (page 401):On those sections of highways which are or become a part of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways and other controlled-access highways, it shall be unlawful for any person:  [...]  (2) To make a left turn or a semicircular or U-turn except through an opening provided for that purpose in the dividing curb, separation section, or line on said highwaysObviously though there are other laws regarding U-Turns, I just don't know where they are written.I have a few questions about general state roadway laws, all of which are asked in context of the United States.Are state's General Statutes the only written text regarding roadway laws for that state?Is there a written text of federal roadway laws which all states inherit? If a topic is not mentioned in a state's General Statute, is it found somewhere else, such as another piece of state text, the aforementioned federal text, or is it then up to the counties, cities, and local lawmakers to create law for?I may have to use these answers for a co-worker who is very picky and very much likes to say, 'Okay that sounds logical, but where is it actually written as law', so any citation to the written laws are very much appreciated.","answer":"In dealing with the law it's hard to prove a positive, but , but there are none that pertain to rules of the road.There is the law against freeway u-turns that you cite.  governs turning at intersections, and paragraph (c) says that  Local authorities and the Department of Transportation, in their  respective jurisdictions, may modify the foregoing method of turning  at intersections by clearly indicating by buttons, markers, or other  direction signs within an intersection the course to be followed by  vehicles turning thereat, and it shall be unlawful for any driver to  fail to turn in a manner as so directed.That means that a no u-turn exception would have to be explicitly indicated, not just written somewhere and imposed on whoever drives through that town. In some states, left and u-turn is explicitly marked with two kinds of curved arrows and left-only is via the usual left turn arrow, not the 180 arrow. The problem for a driver in NC is that they have to know whether a left arrow without a 180 arrow means 'no u-turn'. In Washington state, u-turns used to be illegal, but they were generally legalized in 1997, and yet intersections do distinctively have left arrows vs. left-and-180 arrows (there are also explicit no u-turn signs). We generally understand this to be a safety indicator, but it is possible that a zealous officer could interpret a single-arrow sign as meaning no u-turn.The NC left turn at intersection law para (b) says  The driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at any intersection  shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand lane lawfully  available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of that  vehicle, and, after entering the intersection, the left turn shall be  made so as to leave the intersection in a lane lawfully available to  traffic moving in the direction upon the roadway being entered.Nothing here says that u-turns are illegal: therefore they are legal. That does not guarantee that you won't be ticketed for making a u-turn, because there may be  a general law against unsafe driving and a particular u-turn might be unsafe. It is also possible that you will get a ticket for a u-turn that is safe and legal, in case the arresting officer has his own understanding of the law. You could contest the ticket in the latter case, on the premise that police have to follow the law and the officer did not in that case. It is possible that the magistrate hearing the case will have a different interpretation of the law and impose the penalty \u2013 you can then appeal that ruling to the highest court. "}

This is fine, remember, the Constitution doesn't tell the states how to run their own government.Once approved, the approval is sent to the Archivist who passes it on to the Director of the Federal Register who inspects it for validity.When the OFR has registered approvals from three-fourths (38) of the states it has passed.The OFR advises the Archivist who publishes that the Constitution has been amended.The only limits are logistical and political.Logistically, while the process is complicated, it could happen in a day, even a working day, if everything went right.Politically, the ratification process is usually reasonably quick (months rather than years). However, the most recent, the XXVII, was 202 years between proposal and ratification by the states.However, the longest period us usually the politics before Congress proposes the amendment."}
{"question":"I've been reading that in the US there's a thing where certain kinds of people leave fake bills with just a corner showing just the dollar amount and the rest hidden under a napkin or peeking out of the check holder, but upon closer inspection turns out to be not real money. Such fake bills contain christian-adjacent texts which read things to the effect of 'Jesus's love is more important than money'.I don't think anyone can tell for sure if any such person who leaves these fake bills does it as a way to propagate their religious beliefs, or to be a cheapskate with an 'excuse', but the bottom line is they're leaving fake bills instead of real bills, and it's not cool to the servers.Some say that the Secret Service will only investigate if the bills appear to be at least not obviously fake in full view, but the way these bills are used, only the real-looking portion is left in the open until the server comes over to collect them.Is such use of 'Jesus money' illegal? Can servers (or managers) of restaurants call the police on the customers for doing that?","answer":"Not paying for a meal, by leaving fake money rather than real money, is theft and a crime. Therefore, it is appropriate to report the crime to police just at it would be if the patrons had 'dined and dashed' without even leaving fake money. Realistically, in the absence of security video, it may be virtually impossible to apprehend the perpetrators based on the report.  But, a police report would substantiate the incident if it happened again, so, if the perpetrators were identified by waitstaff before they fled and were either detained in a citizens arrest or discouraged from leaving in a manner that allowed police to arrive an apprehend them, they could be arrested later.This would not be counterfeiting in most countries since it isn't really trying to make coins or currency that pass as the real thing, just plain old theft."}
{"question":"In :Wooden was sitting at home one evening when he heard a knock at his door. He answered to find an unknown man, who asked to speak with Wooden's wife. Wooden invited the stranger inside while he went to get her. The stranger just happened to be a plain-clothes officer who knew of Wooden's felony convictions. Because people with felony convictions are generally prohibited from possessing firearms, when the officer stepped inside and saw a gun, he arrested Wooden.How is a plain-clothes officer entering your house without identifying himself as an officer not an unreasonable search?","answer":"Wooden made two arguments to suppress the evidence, first that he had not consented to the officer entering his house (the officer and the court disagreed) and the second that even if the officer's entry had been legitimate, the evidence :Much of Wooden's challenge turns on the fact that Mason was neither in uniform nor identified himself as a police officer. Both are true. But generally speaking, neither amounts to improper deception in the Fourth Amendment context. United States v. Baldwin ,  (1966) ). Nor did Mason take any affirmative steps to attempt to deceive Wooden regarding his identity. Mason was silent as to his official position; he did not hold himself out to be anything he was not. He merely asked to speak to Harris and then asked if he could come inside, to get out of the cold.Probably relevant also is that the officer didn't &quot;search&quot; for the rifle that prompted the arrest. Wooden picked it up in plain sight, the search of Wooden's person that revealed the second firearm was done as the officer arrested him for the rifle and the subsequent search of the house was carried out with the consent of the other resident Janet Harris."}

{"question":"Under the  (FRE), can expert witnesses talk about something that was not included in their deposition transcript but is related to the case at hand?","answer":"The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have little to say about the admissibility of expert testimony. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, though, it depends on what &quot;something&quot; is.The fact that a statement was not made during a deposition is not a reason to exclude expert testimony. But the expert's testimony is still subject to all the same rules as any other testimony, so it could be excluded if it were irrelevant, if it violated the rule against hearsay, or if it was speculation.Most importantly, though, is the question of whether the statement is an opinion. Opinion testimony is generally inadmissible, but there are special exceptions for expert testimony.  does require those opinions to be disclosed in an expert report, though it doesn't, on its face, make any undisclosed opinions inadmissible.If that requirement is satisfied, though, it's probably not material that the expert didn't discuss it in a deposition.

{"question":"The President of the United States has invoked his power under the INA toproclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and [...] suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order [...].The relevant section of the INA is at 8 U.S.C. 1182(f):(f) Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President  Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. [...]This question is about the phrases 'immigrant entry' and 'entry as immigrants.'  In particular, there are reports of aliens from these countries, who have already been admitted to the United States for permanent residence, who are in possession of their 'green cards,' having been denied entry to the US, or at least having been denied boarding by airlines.The question, therefore:  Is re-entry of a green card holder properly within the scope of 'immigrant entry'?  In particular, has any court ruled on the question?I have not found any other part of the executive order that could be read as barring green card holders from entering the US, but I may have overlooked something.  Is there another part of the order that is relevant to the entry of permanent residents?","answer":". The cited authority is , a section about inadmissible aliens, which says  Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any  class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the  interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such  period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or  any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the  entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.Thus he has authority to exclude permanent residents from re-entry (they are aliens, and re-entry is a subcase of entry), and has done so for 90 days. In the case of Syrian nationals, under sec 5(c) of the order, they are excluded until the order is changed. Sec. 5(c) of the order specifically declares  Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby  proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is  detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any  such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient  changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian  refugees is consistent with the national interest.The long-term ban on Syrians also specifies 'as refugees', so 'such entry' might not be interpreted to refer to entry of refugee or non-refugee Syrian nationals who are permanent residents. The 90-day ban in 3(c) ('immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens') does not include any further restrictors, apart from the various government-official visas that are exempted, so there would be no basis in the order for excluding permanent residents. Whether this will be strictly enforced is a separate question, though in the period when the order was active (a day), it was applied to permanent residents. Sec. 3(g) allows exceptions 'on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest'. A recent (Saturday the 28th)  says that green card holders 'will need a case by case waiver to return to the United States'.The ban includes immigrants and non-immigrants, so it doesn't particularly matter how 'immigrant' is defined \u2013 what matters is what an alien is. Still, 'immigrant' is defined in  as any alien, except a bunch of categories such as diplomats, tourists, business visitors, people in transit, students, and fashion models and similar, working temporarily here. Any permanent resident has an immigrant visa (but at any rate is an alien, and is either an immigrant or a non-immigrant).Returning to the words of the order, neither 3(c) nor 5(3) limit the ban to issuance of visas, it refers to entry. Not all entry by foreign national requires a visa. The word 'visa' is mentioned, so it is possible to construe that mention as contextually restricting the ban to visas, however 3(a) which is entitled 'Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern' orders the review 'to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA' which indicates that there is no such limitation. does say that a permanent resident is not 'regarded as seeking an admission into the United States'. Admission itself is defined in 8 USC 1101(a)(13)(A), when applied to an alien, as 'the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer'. While a permanent resident is not seeking admission (and is not applying for admission), it would still be consistent with the law to forbid admission (legal entry). If you read 8 USC 1101(a)(13)(C) as granting permanent residents widest latitude to enter without restriction, then that has the absurd consequence that permanent residents are subject to no scrutiny at all. The absurdity is avoided if 'seeing admission' is a step prior to and is distinct from 'being admitted' i.e. 'lawfully entering'."}

{"question":"I recently rented a unit sight-unseen (moving across country while working). The building had good reviews from previous tenants and the property manager provided photos of the unit.Upon moving in, the photos I was provided are of an entirely different unit. The unit listed on the lease is missing appliances, shows water damage, and was built to be accessible (very low counters, low toilets, no rim on the shower pan, etc.).I'm frustrated both with having been obviously misled about which unit I was renting and am in constant discomfort from having to work on lowered surfaces.I've browsed local websites and other questions here for a discussion of being misled by a landlord, but can't find what an appropriate action might be.Ideally, I would like to terminate the lease without penalty (and move to a different apartment). Is there a course of action that enables this?","answer":"You've signed a lease, which is legally binding, so you need to determine 1) what exactly was stated in the rental offer by the property manager and\/or website about the available apartments, if a certain apartment was guaranteed, and if one could be substituted for another by the manager due to availability and other factors; and 2) you need to find out exactly what the lease says that you have signed, i.e. if there are terms that allow you to break the lease without penalty, such as misrepresentation by the landlord or property manager.If it turns out the manager did misrepresent the rental property, you may be able to break the lease. If the property manager stated at some point that the apartment represented by the photos may not be the actual property, you may be out of luck.Before confronting the property manager again, gather up all your emails, documents, photos and any other evidence - such as written descriptions of any phone calls and talks you had with the property manager before and after the move in - and talk to either a legal aid organization that specializes in rental aid (Google for your area in CO), or a lawyer who deals in leases and offers free initial consultations.Other than that, this site is not for specific legal advice, i.e. if you should sue the landlord to break the lease and move; that's your judgement and the advice of any legal representation."}

But, construction projects on public property generally have to be bonded and the bonding company is usually stated either in the contract or in a public document authorizing the project.So, instead of placing a lien on the property, one makes a claim against the public works bond in a very similar manner. The first time you do this, you need a lawyer, because both the formalities of the bond claim document and the timing are often very particular with very short statutes of limitations (week or months, not years) although once you learn the process, you can probably make the initial bond claim yourself, although you would need a lawyer to bring suit to enforce it if the bonding company doesn't pay the claim without complaint."}
{"question":"Hypothetically...Say I wanted to re-write the constitution of the United States. Not amend it, but completely start over. Could I do that within the law?You've done it before, when the Articles of Confederation were replaced. Maybe I want to tidy away all the amended parts that no longer apply. Or maybe I have some nefarious motive. (Evil laugh.)Would I need to pass The Last Amendment that states my new constitution is the constitution and I'd only need to persuade 38 states to agree?Or, is there only scope for a series of amendments that can never change what came before, only effectively nullify it?","answer":"Article Five outlines the process for the legal amending of the Constitution by both Congress (to the tune of 27 times) and the Constitutional Convention (to the tune of never... save for the original Constitution Drafting).  Article Seven stipulates how the proposed constitution would become The Constitution.At present, an amendment must pass both Houses of Congress with 2\/3rds of the vote.  It is then voted upon by the states until such time as 3\/4ths of the states agree to the proposed amendment, at which time, it becomes a part of the constitution and enforceable as such.  It has been common to put a time limit on amendments so that the 3\/4ths of the state must make the change relatively soon.  There is no hard rule for this, as the most recent amendment was passed by the States after Congress passed it with the original Bill of Rights.The Constitutional Convention has never been tried and is therefor a bit of legal danger as there is no provision that supports the limited scope of a convention nor opposes it (One could call a Convention to pass a balanced budget amendment and emerge with a Constitution that makes North Korea look like a Democratic paradise by comparison, if not limited in scope.).In addition, Article Seven is the article which describes the manner by which the Constitution would become The Constitution and what it needed to do to get there (get passed by 9 of the 13 states, at which time, the 9 undersigned states would be under the rule of the U.S. Constitution, while the remaining four would be left to their own device until they signed.).An Amendment to the Constitution, is essentially a rewrite and there are several Amendments that overturn language in the Constitution (the 14th Amendment overturned the 3\/5ths compromise in Article One, section 2, which at this time, only applied to penal servitude as slavery was outlawed in the 13th amendment).  The 17th Amendment superseded Article 1, section 3 (originally states' legislatures appointed the Senators).  The 18th Amendment was fully repealed by the 21st Amendment.  When this happens, most copies of the constitution used for study will show this by having a line struck through the original text and further annotate what amendment affected this section to be struck out.  It is essentially no different than you writing something down in ink, then scratching it out and writing a new item (this isn't done on original constitutions written by the framers... those are historical artifacts.).Of course, there is nothing that allows the citizens of the United States to Rebel and form a new system of government that outright replaces the constitution.  More importantly, to the framer's mind I suspect, there is nothing that says you Cannot Rebel and start your own new government (with Black-Jack and Hookers!) (Also, if you've read your Federalist Papers, they are much more candid that the Second Amendment was put there so the people had a way to rebel if it became necessary... one Federalist Paper openly states there should be no problem with a private citizen owning ships that were armed with cannons that could compete with contemporary naval vessels.  Consider that the Founding Fathers were rebels).  But by including the Amendment Process, they would hope to protect their rebellion from the next by allowing for ways to change the problems they did not think of in a less bloody method than their own rebellion."}

{"question":"From :British anti-bully researchers Andrea Adams and Tim Field have used the expression \"workplace bullying\" instead of what Leymann called \"mobbing\" in a workplace context. They identify mobbing as a particular type of bullying that is not as apparent as most, defining it as \"an emotional assault.It begins when an individual becomes the target of disrespectful and harmful behavior. Through innuendo, rumors, and public discrediting, a hostile environment is created in which one individual gathers others to willingly, or unwillingly, participate in continuous malevolent actions to force a person out of the workplace.\":But this is a hostile working environment! And so it is, but it isn't necessarily against the law. To management, it is progressive discipline: every act of the employee that could possibly be treated as malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance is documented and treated as cumulative. To the employee, it is unfair, demoralizing and counterproductive, but except for hostile working environment, employees have not had a single word like discrimination to express the concept. Now several writers have put a name on the concept, and have called it mobbing.This specific form of harassment identified in Europe as \"mobbing\", is it the same in the UK and the US?Edit: there is a hint at \"mobbing\" in an answer to ","answer":"Short answer: yes and no.I've never heard of this term before, but what you are calling 'mobbing' does, in fact, sound like the dictionary definition of type 2 sexual harassment, at least if said 'mobbing' is done with a sexual bent.  This type of sexual harassment occurs when a co-worker or supervisor in the workplace makes sexual advances or comments to an employee that, while not affecting promotions or the future of the employee's job, makes the working environment of the employee offensive and hostile. In general, the comments tend to affect the employee's ability to do her job.Note that this is completely different from 'type 1' or 'quid pro quo' style sexual harassment, which is the kind that everyone is aware of; however, this version occurs quite often as well and is pretty well codified.Again, that's straight-up sexual harassment, though; there are other illegal forms of harassment that deal with singling out someone because of their race or creed, for example. That being said, I am no lawyer but the simple act of ganging up on a worker is not, I don't think, in and of itself illegal. If you're being ganged up on because you're black, or because you were a whistle-blower, that's one thing, but if people are ganging up on you simply because they don't like you, well, I'm sorry but you probably don't have any recourse (please note that I am not a lawyer and that this is not a site to receive legal advice from).More info on 'mobbing':"}
{"question":"The federal govt has sole jurisdiction in making and enforcing immigration laws and regulations in the US.\"The US immigration policy is regulated at the federal level. Although certain matters pertain to the states, federal laws trump those laws. There may be occasional circumstances in which the states play a bigger role, but generally, federal law has more power to enforce the immigration laws of the US.\"It's generally unconstitutional for states to make their own laws regarding immigration into the US.Is the act of birthing a new American (since a fetus is not a citizen until birth) a function of immigration law? IE state laws regulating birth (either forcing them or preventing them) would not be constitutional as they are regulating immigration separate from the Federal govt.","answer":"While in many areas of law the federal government and states have concurrent jurisdiction, immigration is not one of them.The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over immigration, and the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution makes birth in the United States an event relevant for citizenship, although Congressionally enacted immigration law also makes birth to a U.S. citizen or U.S. national parent relevant for immigration law.So far as I know, state laws sometimes state that life begins at conception, but never say that birth occurs at some other time such as conception, and birth is the relevant event for immigration law. But that doesn't mean that a state couldn't enact a law that stated that birth occurs at conception (indeed, something close to that concept is the law in South Korea where historically you have been counted as one year old at birth and you get one year older for legal purposes each New Year's Day, regardless of when you were actually born, a law it is thinking of reforming in the near future to the global norm).But, even if a state did this, it wouldn't matter. In the United States, words routinely mean different things in different laws. Words don't even always have the same meaning in different laws enacted by the same government. The fact that a state enacts a law defining something, for the purposes of some or all state laws, has no legal effect on the meaning of the same thing for purposes of a particular federal law. States legally define terms in a manner inconsistent with particular federal laws for their own purposes all the time.On the other hand, this state law would not be unconstitutional, except to the limited extent that it purports to make its definition effective for purposes of federal law.For example, a definition enacted for purposes of a homicide statute, would not conflict with an immigration law that uses a different definition, and would not be unconstitutional on the grounds that it regulated immigration which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government.If the state statute were ambiguous regarding whether it applied to terms in federal laws, it would be interpreted to only apply to the use of that term under state law to avoid the constitutional question that would otherwise arise."}

{"question":"Do women have the same rights as men to walk on the beach or sidewalk topless where men are also walking bare-chested without being discriminated against? If a woman is arrested or asked to leave by enforcement, but not the men, is that blatant sexual discrimination? Would that be a lawsuit that can be pursued?Let us say this issue does go to the Supreme Court. Would women be allowed walk half naked, men to not be allowed to walk with their breasts out (yes some men do and lactate) and\/or allow some public places made acceptable like half nude beaches or areas of town where men and women can enjoy the freedom to be shirtless together? How would this play out? ","answer":"In April 2017, a US District court on Colorado ruled that a law prohibiting women from exposing their breasts in public was an unconstitutional discrimination against women. The law was ordinance 134 passed by Fort Collins, Colorado  in May 2016. The group opposing it was led by the activist organization 'Free the Nipple.' This ruling is not binding in other states, however. See  for more details. The case is being appealed to the Tenth Circuit. A similar ordinance has been taken to state court in New Hampshire on similar grounds as described in A similar claim in Illinois in 2017 resulted in a law against 'public indecency' being upheld (in Tagami v. City of Chicago) at the Federal Appeals Court level, according to  A similar law in Ocean City, Maryland, was challenged in federal court in the summer oif 2018 according to .in 1991 in United States v. Biocic the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld a similar law against a similar challenge. (which gives a similar list):  The vast majority of states actually have laws on the books making clear that women can't be arrested under state law solely for being topless in settings where it's OK for men. But many local ordinances ban the practice anyway.In short, it is not yet fully settled if there is a US constitutional right for a woman to go topless, and state and local laws vary widely. Local laws do not always conform to the laws of the state, but would probably require a court challenge to enforce the state law.Laws in other countries will vary, but many places ban such exposure."}

{"question":"Halocene is an American Indie rock band. In early 2019 they made a cover song of Billie Eilish's song 'Bad Guy'. Halocene say that they did this legally by contacting Eilish first and paying any required royalties. Then, late this year there was a karaoke reality TV show in Australia called The Masked Singer Australia. In it a cover of 'Bad Guy' was also done. Halocene claim that this cover was the same in every aspect as Halocene's earlier cover of the song. Their side by side comparison can be found at  Halocene discuss possible legal action to protect [1] their own cover of 'Bad Guy' and [2] their guitarist's original music composition, made a long time ago, that he included in the cover. Whether Halocene 'should' take legal action against the media company that made the show The Masked Singer Australia is another question; the costs would be enormous and the legal jurisdiction [US? Australia? Elsewhere?] would be unclear. The question of at law 'does Halocene have a civil case for their own work being used without permission?', is more of my question here. ","answer":"Probably notAustralia, like many countries including the USA, has a statutory based compulsory licencing and royalty collection and distribution organisation, .The producers\/broadcaster will have paid APRA AMCOS for the right to use the song and that will filter back to the US organisation with which the rights holder is registered and ultimately to the composer(s).

Also, I'm from Europe while the site seems to be registered from the US if that means anything. Would love some information!PS: the above examples are not the actual domains I'm talking about just similar in nature in terms of the name similarities.","answer":"The first step in any infringement analysis is whether or not the two names are confusingly similar. While this is ultimately a question of fact to be determined in litigation, at face value, the two examples you pose: SportsLad v. SportsLand do not present any realistic prospect for confusion, and sites that exploit common misspellings of protected trademarks are normally not considered to be infringing either.The fact that the two names have different pronunciations in most dialects of English and that the words have two distinct meanings (rather than one of them not having a meaning) also argues against any argument that the two are confusingly similar.Relatively modest differences in domain names which have a very limited character set and, as far as I know, are not case sensitive, are generally given the benefit of the doubt as far as distinctness goes."}
{"question":" is a Wikipedia definition, of something that must happen before something else happens, but I'm not sure how to apply it to the law.Let's say that there is an angel investor that meets a company with an interesting technology, and proposes to invest an amount, X, in the company for a certain percentage. The contract says something like, 'a condition precedent for the investment of X is a demonstration of the company's technology to the investor's reasonable satisfaction.' The company delays in doing the demo, but asks for the money. The investor says, 'no demo, no money.' Is this what 'condition precedent' is meant to say? If there is no express time limit written into the contract, is there an implied, or 'reasonable' time limit after which the investor is off the hook? For instance, if the demo took place six months later, can the investor reasonably say, 'your technology sounded interesting six months ago, but I fear that it has been made obsolete by now.'","answer":"In contract law, a  is a specified event that must occur prior to a party having to perform a contract obligation.In your example, the demonstration is the condition precedent, and funding is the obligation to be performed. So, yes, 'no demo, no money' is another way to put it.The 'investor's reasonable satisfaction' is the standard used to determine whether the condition has been satisfied (and thus whether the obligation will be triggered). The reasonableness standard falls somewhere in the middle segment on a scale of investor-friendly to inventor-friendly contract language. For example, 'the investor's sole discretion' is investor-friendly (though likely subject to a good faith duty); 'the investor's discretion' is still investor-friendly and is limited by a good faith duty; 'the investor's reasonable discretion' anchors the discretion not in what the investor would want to do but in what would be objectively reasonable. Removing investor discretion and replacing it with something like 'upon demonstration' would be inventor-friendly.What is reasonable will vary widely based on the industry and product obsolescence timelines.

See e.g. Golan v.

{"question":"This topic came up when discussing the infamous  from awhile back.  To give a brief summary the author of a small package hosted on the npm repository that numerous other packages had (indirect) dependencies on decided to remove his package in protest of the repositories policies.  The result was that a significant number of highly important programs and packages all failed overnight when the dependency they all required could no longer be found.We were wondering, purely hypothetically, could the developer have done something more malicious legally.  Let's say, purely hypotehtically, that instead of removing the left-pad software he instead changed it so that it now did some bizzare or malicious behavior, like trying to remove everything from the computer (which the browser should prevent), or giving the wrong response 1\/5 of the time (which would be allowed and would be much harder to trace the root issue to.Assuming the individual fully documented the change and new behavior when he updated his source code then this package would still be doing exactly what it reported to do, and as such arguably anyone who downloaded the package would thus be choosing to run whatever bizzare apparently-malicious behavior he had added to the code.  In reality the nature of how package dependencies work means that most people wouldn't know they had a dependency on the package, much less read the documentation to know that this package their unaware of now does something malicious.Legally, if a develop tried something like this with a package would they be guilty of a crime?  Or is it within the developers legal rights to change a package to do whatever he chooses, so long as documented, and thus fall under some 'buyer beware' clause where it's their fault they didn't realize the package had new functionality?for now I'll narrow this down to focusing on US law, since I believe that's where the original author of the package lived.","answer":"The following list of the grounds on which virus creation or distribution may be found to be illegal: from     Unauthorized access - you may be held to have obtained unauthorized access to a computer you have never seen, if you are responsible for distribution of a virus which infects that machine.

However, I have some questions regarding that form:Am I required to send Form 1099 to non-US citizens who are not even residing in the US? Since they're not required to file US taxes, do I still have to send the form to them?Is it fine to expose my TIN (taxpayer identification number) to individuals or companies who I send the form to them. Since the form requires me to write my TIN\/EIN, what would be the risks of this and what precautions should be taken to avoid inappropriate\/illegal use?I send payments via PayPal and wire transfer. Should I send form 1099-MISC or 1099-K?","answer":"tl;dr:No.You don't have a choice.It depends, but the options are 'no form' or 1099-MISC.  You'll never send a 1099-K.The only 1099 you would potentially be required to send for business payments is a 1099-MISC.  The  are pretty clear as to when and how you must use that.Note that you don't send 1099-K's unless you are a payment settlement entity.  Furthermore, if you transmit the funds using a payment settlement entity who will report the transaction on a 1099-K, then you don't need to report it on a 1099-MISC.  (See 'Form 1099-K' .)Fortunately, PayPal is a payment settlement entity, so you don't need to worry about reporting payments you send through them ... with one big exception: PayPal does not report 'payments to friends and family,' and so if you're using that to avoid their fees then the IRS would consider you liable for reporting payments on a 1099-MISC.  To my knowledge banks do not report wire transfers, so you would have to file 1099-MISC when required for payments sent that way.Regarding your TIN: Yes, these numbers get circulated in the course of business.  But this is actually one of the few legal uses of those numbers, and it's required, so if you're worried about identity theft or something then buy insurance against that.  And if you think you've got it bad, just think how your payment recipient must feel: Before you send funds that would need to be reported next year you are supposed to demand a signed  to 'Secure Your Tax Records from Identity Theft.'Regarding payments to entities not subject to U.S. taxation: You don't have to report those, and the fact that you reasonably believe the entity to be foreign is considered adequate to omit them from your 1099-MISC filings."}
{"question":"Suppose a contractual obligation is formed under EU law (e.g., by consumer protection laws).  Now suppose that the parties to that contract (a buyer and a vendor or manufacturer) have agents in a non-EU country (say in Asia).  Should they be able to adjudicate the contract under the local judicial system, even though the local system's laws create no such contract?Update: Answers concerning the rest of the world, besides the US, would be much appreciated.","answer":"Generally, yes (at least in the United States). The question of which court a lawsuit should be filed in is often one of convenience when the lawsuit is filed; it is not that unusual for this to be a different jurisdiction than the natural jurisdiction when the contract was made. For instance,  is a case in which two US soldiers got into a car crash while stationed in Germany, and one sued the other in Oklahoma court when they returned home. The plaintiff also sued the defendant's insurance, which was allowed under German laws but not Oklahoma laws. However, the Oklahoma Supreme Court determined that the contract was intended to be governed by German law (since it was sold in Germany), and so it made sense to apply the provisions of German law to the contract.There are exceptions. Courts can decline to enforce terms that are contrary to local public policy; for instance, no US court will enforce a contract that amounts to indentured servitude. For a more common example, employment contracts can have non-compete clauses. In California, those contracts are considered to be against public policy, and are unenforceable regardless of what law the contract was made under. But those are the exceptions; in general, US courts are perfectly willing to hear a case and apply foreign law if it makes sense to apply the foreign law and to hear the case in the US.This actually comes up a fair bit in the US: each of the 50 states and the federal government have their own laws, and it's not unusual for multiple jurisdictions to be reasonable places for a lawsuit. If a contract is signed between two parties in Maryland, but one party is a resident of Pennsylvania, a lawsuit over it could potentially be filed in federal court. In that case, federal procedures are followed, but the actual law applied would pretty much be Maryland law."}

In the case of alcohol sales in North Carolina, for example, there is a  that lists 'acceptable forms of identification' on page 17 and explicitly says that 'passports may be in the booklet or card form.'  But that does not seem to create a legal requirement for the retailer to accept passport cards, because page 19 outlines the retailer's right to refuse, saying among other things that 'there is no legal recourse by a customer who you have refused a sale.'US passport law () doesn't have anything to say about the passport's or passport card's role as an identification document; it speaks only of the more specific role as a travel document.So the general answer to your question, appears to be no.  There is no law generally requiring people to accept a passport card if they also accept passports or driver's licenses.But in most specific instances, there may be a general requirement such as 'government-issued identification' that includes passport cards in addition to passports and driver's licenses, or there may be a list that explicitly includes passport cards along with driver's licenses and passports."}

Some of the apps are referencing sources that often are websites like: (University of Sydney)Well, I browsed the websites and googled a lot to find some information about the license used but I haven't found any information. Do the apps steal the data, pay for it or is it okay to use it (even commercially) if they mention the source?Maybe this question sounds odd for US citizens but I'd be very glad if someone could clear things up for me.","answer":"I don't know what it means to 'steal data', unless you mean 'illegally break into a computer and copy hidden files'. Also, I'm not sure what you mean by 'data' (the 'data' vs. 'conclusion' distinction is not a legal one: a GI is not data, it is a conclusion based on applying an algorithm to observational data). In the case of the USDA site, the data appears to be largely provided by the manufacturer (perhaps to comply with a law about nutritional fact reporting), but maybe figures are culled from scientific publications. The Sydney site seems to be culled from published scientific literature or in some cases their own research.The reported facts are not protected by copyright, so the only way to legally prevent others from knowing those facts is to physically not make the information available, i.e. keep it hidden on your hard drive, or on slips of paper in your house. Somebody could steal the paper (a crime) or hack into the hard drive (a crime), but if you've made the facts public, they are out there for anybody to use.In the case of the USDA site, owing to US copyright law, that web page is a government work and not protected by copyright, so you can copy the content wholesale, art and all. That is not the case with the Sydney site. But even with the Sydney site, you can copy the facts (e.g. you can write down the fact that Divine Date spread has a GI of 29)."}
{"question":"I read on :Currently, in the United States, the standards for UPF are voluntary.This made me wonder:  Does displaying the UPF value on a textile (or its description on a merchant's webpage) have any legal binding in the United States?","answer":"It is not binding in the sense that a contract term is binding and enforceable, but it has potential legal power. It possibly represents a factual claim, and factual claims in advertising cannot be deceptive. Since there is no legal standard (contrast with ), the proof required to establish deceptiveness is less clear. For instance, for 'organic' certification, the land may not have been treated with prohibited substances for at least 3 years, therefore 2 years is not good enough by that standard. AATCC Test Method 183 is not legally authoritative, so variation in the procedure is permissible. Still, if you cook up some cockamamie procedure and declare actual UPF 5 to be UPF 50, that would likely be found to be deceptive."}

{"question":"In the U.S., is it legal to prohibit your tenants from posting outside signs in the rental agreement? E.g. election signs, flags etc. Or would that be a violation of their right if they are renting from you.","answer":"It would appear that it is legal to make such prohibitions as a condition of their lease. The first amendment prevents government from interfering with your right to speech; it does not prevent you agreeing to refrain from exercising it in a contract. Presumably, someone who feels strongly enough about this will rent somewhere else or otherwise negotiate it out of the lease.From   Although cities and other government entities are constrained by the First Amendment in regulating political yard signs, there is no similar restraint imposed on private homeowner and condominium associations.

In general it is intended as a last ditch measure, and the circumstances of the case must be considered.In this case, after Assange spent several years holed in at Ecuador's embassy in the UK, and given that he did not surrender himself voluntarily, it is not that unreasonable to believe that he would try again to flee, as the matter is not still settled and he is still at risk of being extradited.I do not know about England, but in some countries (e.g. Spain) if you are kept in preventive custody but later found to be innocent you are automatically entitled to an indemnity.Also, for the larger question, that is not true either at least in some countries. After a guilty veredict a judge may postpone incarceration while appeals are reviewed (again considering things like flight risks). Of course, if you have condemned someone who has not been given bail due to being considered too risky, they remain in jail during the process.Also Presumably, his jail term began immediately upon sentencing. In many jurisdictions, the time served before the sentence is counted towards the sentence.

{"question":"to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;reserves the right to prepare \"derivative works\" to the authors of the original work.  The original authors, of course, can authorize such work use of their work to other parties.17 USC 106, however, is \"subject to sections 107 through 122.\"   (fair use) allows for an exception to copyright restrictions for the purposes of \"research.\"In a series of comments to a different question, we have stumbled on a question of whether derivative work, which is performed privately and not shown to anyone, constitutes a violation of copyright.  It all seems moot, but I have thought of a scenario where it may become apropos.purely hypothetical scenario hereSuppose someone dabbles in a study of a foreign language X.  Suppose they come across an esoteric industry publication in that language.  They invest some personal time to produce a translation of that publication and fix it on paper.  This would fall within all the parameters necessary to make this translation a derivative work.  However, they do not publish the translation.  Nor do they even show it to anyone.  They do, however, study the material in it after the translation is completed. Having educated themselves on the subject matter covered in the translation, they come up with an invention which becomes commercially viable.  And they develop the invention with a moderate degree of commercial success.  A number of years after, someone else uncovers the unpublished manuscript of the translation and reveals the existence of the translation to the original authors.Do the authors have a copyright violation claim against the translator?  It seems like it should fall under the research exception, but the question is whether the research exception has been tested in court for unpublished derivative works.Rather than speculating what a court might say on the subject, I am curious whether the courts have already said anything on this subject.","answer":"Probably notIt is not at all correct to say that:Section 107 (fair use) allows for an exception to copyright restrictions for the purposes of &quot;research.&quot; reads, in relevant part:Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include [and the section goes on to specify the four statutory factors]The exception is not for &quot;research&quot; but for fair use, for which purposes &quot;such as&quot; research is one aspect of the definition, but not the most important aspect.So let us consider the actual factors in this hypothetical case:(1) the purpose and character of the use,The purpose appears to be for study and research, not for direct commercial exploitation, so factor (1) favors fair use.(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;The hypothetical does not much describe the source work, but it appears to be an original and creative one, but one describing facts of science or technology, not an imaginative work. Factor (20) thus probably favors fair use slightly, but has not much weight in this case.(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a wholeIt would seem that the whole of the source article was translated, so factor three leans against fair use.(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.Because the translation is not published nor widely circulated, it does not serve as a substitute for the original for the general public, nor is there any harm done to any actual or potential market for the original. No economic harm is done to the copyright holder, nor would there be any such harm if many people separately engaged in similar use. Thus factor (4) strongly favors fair use.While no one can ever be sure what a court will rule in a particular fair use determination, the analysis above suggests to me that this use would in fact be held to be a fair use, given the circumstances in the question.What gets eventually exploited in this hypothetical is not the expression of the original source work, but the ideas it contains, and as  says:(b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.Had the researcher translated and paraphrased at once, producing a description of the ideas contained in the original work, but not translating their expression, there would have been no question of copyright infringement.Also, in those cases where the ideas are so closely bound up with their expression that they cannot be expressed in any other way, or only in one of a very few possible ways, the expression loses protection. This can happen with scientific and technical documents.Thus it would appear that there is no infringement in the situation described in the question, but not because of a &quot;research exception&quot;.There is a great deal of case law on fair use in general, but I do not know of any that really closely fits the hypothetical in the question. Fair use case law tends to be tightly tied to the specific facts of the case at hand.In countries other than the US the exceptions to copyright are quite different both from the US concept of fair use and from each other, but this hypothetical would I think fall under an exception in several of them at least."}
{"question":"Say I am a citizen of Malaysia.I am thinking of either opening a corporation in Seychelles or Delaware LLC.As far as I know, both are tax free, cheap, and stuff. Delaware LLC is even cheaper.Delaware LLC, for tax purpose, is a tax 'flow' entities. So if you're an american citizen, you will pay tax as if the income of the LLC is your income.But what about if you are a citizen in other country? From say, Malaysian's point of view, is delaware LLC any different than Seychelles corporation? Both are just foreign entities right?Must you pay tax for any income the delaware LLC have? Assuming you don't repatriate, etc.Note: LLC is a flow through entities. Basically if I were american citizen the tax will flow through as if I don't have LLC. However, given that I am not an american citizen the tax will flow through a foreign entity. From US\/Delaware points of view, the tax flow through outside. From my country points of view, an LLC in delaware owns tax. So no body claims they can tax me.That's the idea.","answer":"First of all, if your Delaware LLC earns money, you will pay tax in America on that money. America still taxes 'foreigners' on American income, just not on'global' income. That is, unless the U.S. has a tax reciprocity treaty with your home country, Malaysia.I don't know about Malaysian law, but I am writing as an American about American law regarding the Seychelles (and I am not a lawyer). The following is only as an 'example.'If you set up an LLC in the Seychelles, you could, in theory, avoid American tax by accruing income there. In practice, if you did nothing but 'banking' in the Seychelles, America would look at your lack of 'value added' there, and could tax you on Seychelles income as if your corporation was American.The way to make such a claim stick (typically in a place like Ireland), is to set up a manufacturing or operating facility (e.g. call center) there so that you were shipping goods or services from your offshore operation. Then you'd have a strong claim in America that your operation actually earned most of its income abroad, and the U.S. company was just a holding company."}

It is possible that anyone who spent time on the base is a class member, or there may be some further requirements.  The clerk of the court handling the cse may be able to provide the approved definition of the class, if that has been established. It may not yet be fully defined, depending on what stage the case has reached.Lawyers handling class action cases often obtain fees in proportion to teh number of plaintiffs who have signed up with them, and so have an incentive to enlist as many potential plaintiffs as possible.Settlements of such cases often provide individual plaintiffs only relatively small payments, but everything varies from one case to another."}

{"question":"This is a follow-up question to ; the accepted answers to each appear to conflict the concept of bona fide purchasers.According to a Wikipedia page on the topic:\"A bona fide purchaser (BFP) \u2013 referred to more completely as a bona fide purchaser for value without notice \u2013 is a term used predominantly in common law jurisdictions in the law of real property and personal property to refer to an innocent party who purchases property without notice of any other party's claim to the title of that property. A BFP must purchase for value, meaning that he or she must pay for the property rather than simply be the beneficiary of a gift. Even when a party fraudulently conveys property to a BFP (for example, by selling to the BFP property that has already been conveyed to someone else), that BFP will, depending on the laws of the relevant jurisdiction, take good (valid) title to the property despite the competing claims of the other party. As such, an owner publicly recording their own interests (which in some types of property must be on a court-recognised Register) protects himself or herself from losing those to an indirect buyer, such as a qualifying buyer from a thief, who qualifies as a BFP.\"This would suggest that any statute that superseded detinue and\/or replevin causes of actions in equity would overrule this doctrine.But looking at it closer, even detinue and replevin would be in conflict with this doctrine; how were they concurrently recognized? What principles may be read out of the equity practice of the courts in the U.S.?Are bona fide purchasers still recognized in U.S. law, and if so, how does that affect statutory provisions in place of detinue and replevin?","answer":"BackgroundThe general common law rule in the U.S. is that someone who transfers property can not give the person receiving the transfer more rights than they have themselves.But, usually, as set forth more specifically in a number of circumstances set forth below, a bona fide purchaser for value without notice (BFP) has greater rights in the property purchased than the person from whom the BFP purchased the property if there are certain kinds of qualifications or imperfections in the seller's title or rights to the property.Also, note that for this purpose, a creditor benefitting from a mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest in property hat is collateral for that obligation is a BFP if the creditor lacks notice of the issue with the debtors interest in the property that is collateral and if the creditor obtained these rights in the collateral for substantially equivalent value (rather than, for example, as a gift or a &quot;sweetheart deal&quot; not entered into a armed length).With some narrow exceptions, outside of bankruptcy, these are questions of state law, but most of the relevant state statutory law is close to uniform across almost all U.S. jurisdictions, because all U.S. jurisdictions have voluntarily and independently (without any federal mandate or monetary incentive) adopted model laws promulgated by the National Commissioners on Uniform State laws on these subjects.There is some minor variation in the real property laws pertinent to this matter between U.S. jurisdictions (i.e. the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the self-governing territories of the U.S. such as Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa). There are also minor variations in the common law and statutory law regarding invalidating restraints on alienation as contrary to public policy between these jurisdictions. But even in these non-uniform areas, the majority rules are very widely adopted.Real PropertyThe General Rule In Race-Notice JurisdictionsIn real property law, U.S. jurisdictions have predominantly adopted a state &quot;race-notice&quot; statute which provide that bona fide purchasers for value take title to property free of any unrecorded interest in the property at the time of the transfer. There are narrow exceptions to this rule for void titles arising, for example, from a forged deed or a &quot;wild deed&quot;, when the adverse possession deadline has not yet expired. Adverse possession is almost always governed by a state statute. Title 11 of the United States Code, i.e. the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, however, applies in cases where the sale is by a bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession in lieu of a bankruptcy trustee, and provides even greater BFP protections.Under a race-notice statute regime, by statute or as supplemented by common law cases, a buyer of real property is deemed to have constructive notice, however, of all properly indexed real property records and of anything that can be discerned from a physical inspections of the property (including, for example, the existing of a unrecorded leasehold interest of a tenant in possession of the property).As noted above, a creditor for whom real estate is collateral for a debt (most frequently a mortgage lender) has the same BFP rights with respect to its collateral interest in the property, as a buyer of outright ownership of the property who receives a deed does in BFP's ownership interest in the property.General Rules For Registered Title And Pure Race Recording StatutesA tiny percentage of U.S. real estate is subject to what is usually called Torrens' Title or registered title which has been copied by most non-U.S. common law jurisdictions from Australia that originally invented the system, or a &quot;pure race&quot; recording statute. Property subject to these system of noting real property rights that allows a purchaser to avoid unregistered interests in that real property even if the transferee has notice of the unregistered interests or is not a transferee for value, effectively affording BFP-type protections to a group of people greater than just BFPs.Common Exceptions To The General RulesNotwithstanding this, there are often state law exceptions to the general protections for BFPs in real property purchases which are less generous to them than the general rule that apply to a property tax treasurers sales (if conducted in an irregular fashion), sheriff's sales (if conducted in an irregular fashion), purchases from governmental entities (if made with apparent authority but not actual authority), unrecorded utility liens, unrecorded utility easements not discoverable by inspection, easements by prescription, and unrecorded HOA liens.Other Real Property Litigation From Which BFPs Are Not ProtectedSometimes, however, a BFP's claim to real property can be litigated in a dispute over what exactly it was that the BFP purchased.For example, suppose that a BFP receives a deed to land not specifically including or excluding mineral rights, which once had severed mineral rights that arguably came into subsequent common ownership. If there was a merger of the mineral rights into the surface rights under the applicable law, the BFP also gets the mineral rights. If there was not a merger, however, the BFP gets only the surface rights.A BFP of an undivided co-ownership of real property is also not immune to a lawsuit to partition the real property. This is sometimes provided for by a state statute and is sometimes a matter of common law.Personal PropertyThe Role Of The Uniform Commercial CodeMany rights of BFPs in personal property are governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted in close to its current draft by all U.S. jurisdictions with only stylistic variation from the uniform act text in most cases. This originally had Article 1 which contained general provisions, and Articles 2-9 which contained substantive provisions. It has since been amended to add Articles 2A (personal property leases) and 4A (electronic fund transfers), and in most jurisdictions, to omit Article 6 (bulk sales governing sales of substantially all of the assets of a business in a de facto transfer of ownership transaction).Unlike European civil and commercial codes, however, this is supplemented by principles of common law and equity, and by more specific state and federal statutes that often supply essential terms.The General Rule For Personal Property, Tangible and IntangibleBFPs of personal property receive non-voidable title if they receive a transfer from someone with voidable title, but not if they receive a transfer from someone with void title (e.g. a thief). Thus, a BFP of someone with void title, such as someone whose chain of title is rooted in larceny, loses to the true owner in a replevin lawsuit (but someone whose title is rooted in a transfer secured through fraud in the inducement, in contrast, may have voidable rather than void title). This is governed primarily by Article 2 and 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code and by Title 11 of the United States Code, i.e. the U.S. bankruptcy code (in cases where the sale is by a bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession in lieu of a bankruptcy trustee).TerminologyThe term &quot;detinue&quot; to describe certain actions seeking possession of tangible personal property has largely fallen into desuetude. The &quot;plain English&quot; terminology for a replevin or detinue claim as a stand alone legal cause of action is &quot;claim and delivery&quot;, and is called &quot;repossession&quot; in the context of an action to enforce a debt secured by a non-possessory security interest (i.e. a personal property mortgage) or non-possessory lien.Personal Property Security InterestsIn the case of a non-possessory security interest (i.e. personal property mortgage) or a non-possessory lien such as an agricultural lien or tax lien in property property, a transferee for value takes free of the lien if it is not recorded in the relevant state's Uniform Commercial Code filings (or in  the case of select kinds of personal property in another designated filing location such as a national registry of aircraft liens, or intellectual property rights arising under federal law, or a motor vehicle certificate of title), even if the transferee has notice of the &quot;unperfected&quot; non-possessory personal property lien (the original party to the security interest agreement is bound by it even if it is not &quot;perfected&quot; by being filed in the relevant place). This is governed primarily by Articles 2A and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, and by statutes setting forth special filing requirements for certain kinds of property like intellectual property, aircraft, and motor vehicles.Negotiable InstrumentsA BFP transferee of a negotiable instrument is called a &quot;&quot; and takes free basically of defenses to the negotiable instrument arising from the underlying transaction in which the negotiable instrument was given as consideration. this is governed by Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code enacted in all U.S. jurisdictions.Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code does most of the heavy lifting, however, together with Federal Reserve regulations governing the payment system, while Article 4 plays a lesser supporting rule.Fact patterns involving BFPs rarely arise under Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code governing electronic fund transfers, because usually EFTs are two party transactions rather than often involving a long chain of transferees the way negotiable instruments (such as checks, money orders, and simple promissory notes) do.Other Negotiable Or Transferrable DocumentsSimilar (but not identical) protections are afforded to BFPs in connection with letters of credit, which are governed by Article 5 of the Uniform Commercial Code, negotiable warehouse receipts, which are governed by Article 7 of the Uniform Commercial Code, and with respect to certain interests in &quot;securities&quot; which are governed primarily in this regard by Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code.Fraudulent Transfers\/Conveyances And PreferencesWith only the rarest exceptions, BFPs are also immune to liability in a fraudulent transfer (i.e. confusingly, a liability as a transferee who received insufficient consideration from an insolvent person to thwart creditors, not a truly forged deed), or preference lawsuit (essentially the same thing in bankruptcy). This is governed either by the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (which is more modern and the majority rule in U.S. jurisdictions), the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (a legacy statute on the books in the remaining U.S. jurisdictions), or Title 11 of the United States Code, i.e. the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, in all U.S. jurisdictions.Public Policy Limitations On Restraint Against AlienationThe First Sale DoctrineAlso, while it isn't strictly a BFP question, the  that provides that a buyer of a good at a first retail sale of a good takes free of all intellectual property claims that apply to that particular good, is closely akin to the BFP doctrines. This is largely a matter of federal patent, trademark, and copyright law.Other Public Policy Invalidating Restraints On AlienationState statutory and common law public policies against undue restrains on alienation (including, but not limited to, the rule against perpetuities) also often operate similarly to BFP protections.For example, certain common law future interests in real property (e.g. defeasible estates such as the future interest holders of property held in &quot;&quot;) are eliminated by a transfer to a BFP under state law in many states.AnalysisThese analysis questions pertain, in particular, to tangible personal property which can be subject to detinue or replevin claims (a.k.a. &quot;claim and delivery&quot;, or &quot;repossession&quot; claims), so the answers to these omit issues related to intangible personal property and real property addressed above.This would suggest that any statute that superseded detinue and\/orreplevin causes of actions in equity would overrule this doctrine.Detinue and replevin causes of action are often creatures of court rule that aren't expressly created by any statute. Both detinue and replevin are claims for relief that arise in law, rather than equity.The BFP doctrine can be, and sometimes is, overridden by statute, although it is more common for BFP rights to be expressly stated in a statute as exceptions to the unstated common law default general rule that one can only transfer property to the extent that you own it.But looking at it closer, even detinue and replevin would be inconflict with this doctrine; how were they concurrently recognized?What principles may be read out of the equity practice of thecourts in the U.S.?There are lots of transactions that don't involve BFP rights or where BFPs do not have special rights relative to other transferees of tangible personal property. Those are the predominant cases in which detinue and replevin claims are brought. These mostly include the following five categories of cases:Actions to repossess property that is collateral for a debt subject to a duly &quot;perfected&quot; security interest or lien filed or registered in the appropriate place, following a default on the underlying debt, where the creditor chooses not to avail itself of its right to repossess the collateral without court process in order to reduce creditor liability risks, or because this cannot be done without a breach of the peace.Actions to repossess property in the possession of the primary party to the debt and security agreement that is collateral for a debt subject security agreement (even if the security interest or lien is not &quot;perfected&quot;), following a default on the underlying debt, where the creditor chooses not to avail itself of its right to repossess the collateral without court process in order to reduce creditor liability risks, or because this cannot be done without a breach of the peace.Actions to recover possession of property when the person in possession of it did not acquire possession of the property by sale (e.g. an ex-roommate, or a seller holding goods on a consignment basis).Actions to recover possession of property from someone who is not a BFP and has voidable title to the property, by someone with a superior claim to title to the property to the person in possession of it (e.g. someone who acquired the property through a gift that was a voidable fraudulent transfer, or through their own fraud in the inducement of a sale).Actions against BFPs whose chain of title to the tangible personal property is rooted in larceny."}
{"question":"I'm a bit confused by the usage of the phrase 'common law' on this site. The Wikipedia  initially describes it as an abstract concept. The first paragraph reads:Common law (also known as case law or precedent) is law developed by  judges through decisions of courts and similar tribunals that decide  individual cases, as opposed to statutes adopted through the  legislative process or regulations issued by the executive branch.Later on, the phrase also seems to refer to a specific body of English law established by court precedent:Common law originated during the Middle Ages in England,[7] and from  there was propagated to the colonies of the British Empire [..]This is more consistent with what I'm seeing on this site where specific laws are being cited as part of common law. So my understanding is that the phrase 'common law' can refer to either the concept of laws established by court precedent or it can refer to a specific body of laws that have been established that way.What confuses me now is the relationship between common law in different countries. I usually see the phrase being used here simply as 'common law' without qualification such as 'U.K. common law' or 'Virginia common law'.Should I just be inferring that from context? Is there a single body of 'common law'? Are there distinct bodies of 'U.K. common law' and 'U.S. common law' for example? If so, how are they related? Do judges in common law countries cite court decisions in other common law countries?","answer":"  So my understanding is that the phrase 'common law' can refer to either the concept of laws established by court precedent or it can refer to a specific body of laws that have been established that way.Yes.  Should I just be inferring that from context?Yes.  Is there a single body of 'common law'?No.  Are there distinct bodies of 'U.K. common law' and 'U.S. common law' for example?Yes, furthermore there is different common law in England\/Wales, Northern Ireland &amp; Scotland and each state of the US. Further, Scotland and Louisiana are not straightforward common law jurisdictions but rather a blend of common and civil law.  If so, how are they related?They are related in that they all:have a common source, middle English common law evolve in the same way - judges interpreting the current common law and the statutes of the legislature follow an appeals system through higher levels of courts. They do not all go in the same direction though.  Do judges in common law countries cite court decisions in other common law countries?Sometimes; it depends on the 'distance' of the other jurisdiction. A judge in New South Wales is quite likely to consider how judges in Queensland and Victoria have considered similar laws, less likely to look at the UK and Canada and extremely unlikely to look at the USA. This has a lot to do with how far back it is since the 'last common ancestor' of the law; the longer the corpus of law has been separated the more likely that the principles have diverged, partly this is cultural drift but mostly this is differences in statutes that actively modify the common law. Usually, jurisdictions within the same country are quite close to each other; partly due to common culture but often because of a genuine effort to 'harmonise' laws across borders.There are occasions, however, where legislatures 'steal' laws from other jurisdictions, in which case they often look to each other for early development of common law on those laws. For example, the Alberta (Canada)  both address the same 'wrong' and both had a common and parallel genesis pre-enactment; early cases in each jurisdiction were watched by the other."}
{"question":"I was pulled over and the cop said that the reason was that when he ran the tags he couldn't find insurance on the car.A former officer told me that, that is not a reason to pull someone over. He said if someone is speeding, ran a red light, made a wrong turn etc. those are reasons to pull someone over and THEN if it comes up that you don't have insurance or they can't find it I'm their system, that's when they can add that on as no proof of insurance.

The Union law should be the prevailing one.What exactly is the status of polygamy for hindus in Goa?","answer":"The Union Government Law supersedes the state in case of ambiguity ... What exactly is the status of polygamy for hindus in Goa?The Union law need not necessarily supersede the state law. Article 254(2) of the indian constitution allows state laws to exist, even when it conflicts with central laws, if the centre gives its official consent for it by Presidential assent and the law is promulgated. The Supreme Court of India has also affirmed this in its judgement in :(iv)  Where, however, a law made by the State Legislature on a subject covered by the Concurrent List is inconsistent with or repugnant to a previous law made by Parliament, then  such a  law can  be protected by obtaining the assent of the President under  Art 254(2) of the Constitution. The result of obtaining the assent of the President would be that so far as the State Act is concerned, it will prevail in the State and over-rule theprovisions of the Central Act in their applicability to the State only. Such a state of affairs will exist only until Parliament may at any time make a law adding to, or amending, varying or repealing the law made by the State Legislature under the proviso to Art. 254.As India is yet to adopt a Common or Uniform Civil Code as envisioned in Article 44 of the Indian constitution, and the Goan civil laws are largely a common civil law (with exceptions like the one you noted) the Union government has allowed these laws to exist, without contesting it, in the hope the state legislature will eventually reform it (and this has indeed been happening but at a slow pace) or Parliament will adopt a UCC that will make these laws redundant. Moreover, since no constitution bench has examined these specific provisions of Goan civil laws and struck it down, they do indeed continue to be legal and applicable only in the state of Goa and Daman and Diu.BackgroundThough the makers of the indian constitution favoured creating a single law, applicable to all citizens on civil issues, like marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption etc., they couldn't get a political consensus for it. And thus India decided to continue, with some changes, the old British colonial practice of community specific personal laws.Ambedkar in his speech in the Constituent Assembly had said, &quot;No one need be apprehensive that if the State has the power, the State will immediately proceed to execute\u2026that power in a manner may be found to be objectionable by the Muslims or by the Christians or by any other community. I think it would be a mad government if it did so.&quot; (Source: ).This has resulted in multiple personal laws like Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and Hindu Succession Act, 1956, Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, Indian Succession Act, 1925, Shariat (Application) Act, 1937 and Dissolution of the Muslim Marriage Act, 1939, and neutral ones like the Special Marriages Act etc being in vogue today.Despite this compromise, the constitution makers were all in consensus that reforms in cultural and traditional practice of the various communities were necessary. And India should ultimately have a common civil code applicable to all Indians in the future. This was emphasised by including Article 44 in the  (pdf) that says:Uniform civil code for the citizens.  The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.India has a federal system of governance and on some subjects both the state legislature and the central legislature can make laws. The civil issues:Marriage and divorce; infants and minors; adoption; wills, intestacy and succession; joint family and partition ...where UCC is desired, is in the  meaning that states too are allowed to make laws on these subjects.The modern state of Goa and UT Daman and Diu were once Portuguese territories. So unlike the rest of India where British laws applied, the  (pdf) was in practice here for decades. And, as was the practice of Portuguese colonial rule, the code had been extended to protect the &quot;practice and customs of the locals&quot;:Article 9 \u2013 The Government is empowered to extend the Civil Code to the overseas provinces, after hearing competent agencies and after making modifications, which are required by special circumstances of the provinces.In the exercise of this permission, the Government published the Decree of 18-11-1869 extending the Code to the overseas provinces safeguarding the usages and customs of the natives of the New Conquests. The Code came into force therein on 01st July, 1870. Subsequently by Decree of 16th December, 1880, it ordered safeguarding in favour of the gentile Hindus of Goa without distinction of Old and New Conquests, their special and peculiar usages and customs reviewed and codified by this decree.Thus, as pointed out in this , the specific section of the Code of Gentile Hindu Usages and Customs of Goa that allows polygamy for Hindus are:The marriage contracted by a male Hindu by simultaneous polygamy shall not produce civil effects, except in the following cases only:(1) Absolute absence of issues by the wife of the previous marriage until she attains the age of 25 years.(2) Absolute absence of male issue, the previous wife having completed 30 years of age, and being of lower age, ten years having elapsed from the last pregnancy.(3) Separation on any legal grounds when proceedings from the wife, and there being no male issue.(4) Dissolution of previous marriage ...(Basically, the law unfairly permits a Hindu man to marry again in case his current wife can't produce a male heir for him).When India freed Goa and Daman and Diu from Portuguese rule, and integrated it with India, they incorporated and retained many of the old Portuguese laws including the Portuguese civil code. Despite ongoing reviews of the old laws, these aspects of family laws have not been recalled or re-codified and thus are still legally applicable.As the questioner pointed out, this state law permitting polygamy under specific circumstances is in contradiction with the the  that legally bars Hindus from a bigamous or polygamous relationship:<ol start='5'>Conditions for a Hindu marriage. - a marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely: (i) neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage; ......Void marriages. - Any marriage solemnized after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto, [against the other party], be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of section 5.Punishment of bigamy. - Any marriage between two Hindus solemnized after the commencement of this Act is void if at the date of such marriage either party had a husband or wife living; and the provisions of sections 494 and 495 of the Indian Penal Code shall apply accordingly.Moreover,  also makes it a punishable offence:<ol start='494'>Marrying again during lifetime of husband or wife.  Whoever, having a husband or wife living, marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.Article 254 of the constitution of India is meant to address what should happen in case of such conflicts when both the state and the central legislature make different laws on the same subject in the concurrent list,Inconsistency between laws made by Parliament and laws made by the Legislatures of States.(1) If any provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament which Parliament is competent to enact, or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List, then, subject to the provisions of clause (2), the law made by Parliament, whether passed before or after the law made by the Legislature of such State, or, as the case may be, the existing law, shall prevail and the law made by the Legislature of the State shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void.(2) Where a law made by the Legislature of a State with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an existing law with respect to that matter, then, the law so made by the Legislature of such State shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, prevail in that State:Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislature of the State.Since the Goan laws have not been challenged and over-ruled in any constitutional court and has been promulgated as law with the assent of the President of India and have been in practice since then, Article 254 (2) applies for this particular case and thus the Goan law prevails in Goa and Daman and Diu.Moreover, it can be argued that the legal standing of the Goan Civil Code is strengthened by Article 44 of the Indian constitution, as Goa is the only Indian state currently honouring it (even if by a faulty quasi-&quot;Uniform Civil Code&quot;) and Parliament is yet to make any Common \/ Uniform Civil Law.(All said, in my personal opinion the courts can indeed strike down that particular provision related to allowing polygamy if it is challenged in the Supreme Court today because it no longer meets the .)"}

","answer":"You are in effect asking if this is a case of Fair use, an important US-specific legal concept in copyright law. Please review Deciding whether a use is a fair use is always a fact-driven, case-by-case, process. No one ever knows for sure if a use is a fair use unless that specific use is challenged in court as infringement, and the fair use defense is raised and sustained or not.  Courts evaluate fair use claims on a case-by-case basis, and the outcome of any given case depends on a fact-specific inquiry. This means that there is no formula to ensure that a predetermined percentage or amount of a workor specific number of words, lines, pages, copiesmay be used without permission.   ('More Information on Fair Use' -US Copyright office)FactorsLet's look at the fair-use factors in the case of this photo:Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes: The use is apparently for clearly commercial purpose. This tends to weigh against fair use, but does not rule it out. Then the is the question of whether the use is transformative. The background image apparently serves its original decorative purpose. Whether making it part of an ad is transformative might be debated.Nature of the copyrighted work: The graffiti is an artistic and creative work, not a work of non-fiction or news reporting or factual information. This also tends to weigh against fair use.Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole: It seems that almost all of the work of graffiti, or at least a significant part of it, is being used. This tends to weigh against fair use to some degree. moreover, the  work of graffiti is quite prominent in the background of the work, which ,means it makes a significant contribution to the final work, which also weighs against fair use.Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work: If the work of graffiti is currently being marketed, the question does not say so, and i would suppose that it isn't. There could be a potential market: the artist could make photos or prints of the work and market them, for example. Even so, this image probably wouldn't affect such a market much. This factor probably inclines towards fair use, but it is hard to say just how a court would asses it.Case lawIn Ringgold v. Black Entertainment Television, Inc., 126 F.3d 70 (2d Cir. 1997) A poster of a church quilt was used in the background of a television series for 27 seconds. This was held not to be fair use. The court was influenced by the prominence of the poster, its thematic importance for the set decoration of a church, and the fact that it was a conventional practice to license such works for use in television programs. This case seems particularly close to the one in the question.In Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. 448 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 2006) posters of Grateful Dead concerts were reproduced in a book. This was held to be fair use. The reduced size of the images, and their appearance in the context of a timeline were considered significant.In  A modified photo of a Wisconsin mayor was reproduced on a Tshirt and used to raise money for an event. the photo was posterized, background removed, text added, and a lime green outline featuring the mayor's smile remained. The resulting image of the mayor, the court stated, can't be copyrighted.  Defendants removed so much of the original that,   as with the Cheshire Cat, only the smile remains.  Defendants started with a low--resolution version   posted on the City's website, so much of  the original's detail never had a chance to reach  the copy; the original's background is gone; its   colors and shading are gone; the expression in  Soglin's eyes can no longer be read; after the   posterization (and reproduction by silk--screening),  the effect of the lighting in the original is almost   extinguished. What is left, besides a hint of  Soglin's smile, is the outline of his face, which   can't be  copyrighted.(I take this to mean that the elements actually copied do not have enough original content to be a copyrightable wqrk.)In Kelly v. Arriba-Soft, 336 F.3d. 811 (9th Cir. 2003) use of thumbnail images in search engine results was held to be fair use. The reduced size and image quality were significant to the court. So was the transformative use of the images to help identify and index the pages. ConclusionThis is not a clear-cut case, in my view, but the case for fair use does not seem strong to me.Copyright protection of Unauthorized GraffitiA number of comments and some other answers have raised the question of whether graffiti made without the permission of the owner or tenant of the location, and therefore illegally, are entitled to copyright protection.The first thing to say is that there is nothing in 17 USC (the US copyright law) that conditions copyright protection on the legality of the work, or of its publication.Case law on this precise issue is not easy to find, nor does there seem to be much of it.IPWatchDog's '' (2018) says:  Several high-profile companies, American Apparel, Coach, American Eagle Outfitters and H&amp;M who shot advertisements in public spaces, have found themselves inadvertently in the midst of such legal disputes with street artists. Even though an advertiser may have had permission from the property owners, even though the artwork was unsanctioned and unsigned or tagged, the graffiti artists have come forward after the ads were already in circulation, identified themselves and sought compensation and damages.It goes on to say that:  These cases tend to be settled out of court, because regardless of the merit of an infringement claim, they are costly to defend and the unwarranted negative publicity can injure a company's reputation. ... Also, from a legal standpoint, the question of whether the copyrights of illegally created street art are valid has not yet been determined \u2013 so there would be some element of doubt as to how a litigation would be decided.*The Atlantic's article '' about the case of graffiti artist David Anasagasti's case against American Eagle Outfitters for use of his work (and several other similar suits) quotes  Philippa Loengard, assistant director of Columbia Law School's Kernochan Center for Law, Media, and the Arts as saying:  Given what I know of the case, this is one of the most blatant examples of copyright infringementNone of the suits mentioned in the story seem to have resulted in a court decision as yet.In , the trial judge held that the art was not 'part of' the building and thus the exemption for photos of architectural works under 17 USC 120 does not apply. However it denied plaintiff's DMCA claim and his claim for punitive damages.The court :  because the facts in the record tend to establishif anythingthe lack of a relevant connection between the mural and the parking garage, the Court cannot hold as a matter of law that the mural is part of an architectural work under Section 102(a)(8). Thus, it cannot reach the issue of whether Section 120(a) applies to the mural to permit photographs of the mural. In an article in the  N.Y.U. Journal of IP &amp; Entertainment Law '' author Celia Lerman argues that copyright should protect unauthorized, illegal graffiti art. This article notes that:  Graffiti  pieces  increasingly  attract  the  attention  of  numerous  collectors,  gallery owners, publishers, filmmakers, and journalists. Pieces from famous graffiti artists  have  sold  for  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  in  the  art  market.  Graffiti pieces  have  even  been  given  as  diplomatic  gifts.  Galleries  are  seeing  record  attendance at exhibitions of graffiti works, and publishers have generated a boom of  photographic  books  on  graffiti  and  street  art. (citations omitted)The article notes that Tattooed Walls a book by Peter Rosenstein about NYC Graffiti, reproduced images of many works of graffiti without permisison, the author believed that these were fair use because they were posted in public places. Several artist sued, a settlement was agreed to, and the book was withdrawn from publication.The article mentions a suit against Tony Hawk's   Pro Skater 2 Official Strategy Guide, by the author of a work of graffiti which was reproduced. The suit was initially dismissed for lack of copyright registration, but the court said that it  assumed,  without deciding, that the work is copyrightable. When the suit was refiled after registration, a motion to dismiss was denied, and the parties then settled, so there was no court decision on the merits.Other simialtr cases are mentioned. The article goes on to analyze the law and the purposes that copyright law serves, and give reasons why such works should be protected. But none of this cites an actual case where an illegal graffito has been held protected. The Falkner case will not produce such a ruling, because the art in that case was authorized, indeed invited, by the building owner."}
{"question":"Short versionWe wasted two days waiting for plumber who didn't come until the third day.When he came, he did the job, but then came back and un-did it the day after (claiming the landlord hadn't paid him) - leaving the flat in a worse situation than beforehand.Now we have to waste another day waiting for the plumber to come back to re-do the job.We are tech entrepreneurs with seed investment ranging from ~\uffe115k to \uffe1300k so time=money and we have had to waste a lot of time with this problem now.We don't know who exactly is at fault here - what can we do to 'encourage' the landlord to manage things properly, and the plumber to do his job?  We don't really have time to take legal action - we just want a working flat so we can build our businesses.  If there is some way we could create a perceived threat of legal action, it might help the landlord and\/or the plumber to do their jobs.  Assuming this problem continued another week, what courses of action may be available to us?  What information should we record during that time?To give an example of 'encouragement' - in a past problem with a USA-based clothing seller, simply the mention of the phrase 'small claims court' in a letter to them was sufficient to make them take us seriously.Detailed infoMyself and two friends recently started renting a flat in London.  We are renting from a previous tennant who is subletting (authorized by her landlord\/owner).  We are on an 'assured shorthold tenancy'.Last week, we received notification that the flat below was taking on water from above.  This was identified as a leaky pipe in our flatWe were told that a plumber would come on Monday to repair the pipe.  I stayed home for the day, no plumber came.We were told that the plumber would come on Tuesday.  A flatmate stayed home for that day, but again - no plumber.On Wednesday, the other flatmate stayed at home.  The plumber came and repaired the pipe.  The plumber claimed that he had only been ordered to do the job since Tuesday.On Thursday (today), the plumber came and said that he wanted to do a 'check up'.  The only flatmate in at the time let the plumber in.  The plumber then turned the water off and took his pipes out.  The flatmate protested, the plumber said that he hadn't been paid by the landlord so the pipes were his property, then he left.One flatmate turned the water back on briefly - predictably, this resulted in water freely flowing from where a pipe had been removed.We contacted the landlord and he said that he would pay the plumber on Friday (tomorrow) and that one of us would need to be in the flat to let the plumber in, and to verify that he had done the job properly.We have no water in our kitchen and probably no hot water (I don't want to risk running the on-demand boiler if there's a chance that it the pipes will fill with air).  We have wasted three days and now one of us needs to waste (at least) one more.How can we give the impression that we're prepared to take swift legal action if the situation isn't resolved within the next 24 hours?If the situation isn't resolved within a few days, what courses of action would be available to us, and what information should we be recording during that time?We understand that this site is purely 'friendly community advice' not 'professional legal advice', and is no substitute for formally talking to a lawyer :)","answer":" lists the steps you should take.It can be summarised as: if the landlord fails to arrange the repairs, contact your local council. If they can't help, you can arrange the repairs yourself and request that the landlord reimburse you. If the landlord still refuses to co-operate, then you can pursue legal action.It's important that you document everything you're doing, and keep the landlord fully informed at every step.The guide states that you can deduct the cost from future rent. But it also says:  You do not have the right to withhold your rent if your landlord refuses to do repairs. If you don't pay rent, the landlord could take steps to evict you....so you may want to get expert advice before going any further."}

Is it a defined address?  Can a federal judge set up shop in a state or local court and it be legal?","answer":"Law defines a court of lawA court is a legal construct. Like a government department, a corporation, an army, a police force, or a fire department.For example, the US Supreme Court is defined in Artice Three of the US Constitution:The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.Other US Federal Courts that &quot;Congress may from time to time ordain and establish&quot; are defined in the laws that do that.State Constitutions and laws define the various state courts.The court building is more accurately described as a courthouse - a home for the court - but  &quot;court&quot; can refer to the building.A properly appointed judge can &quot;hold court&quot; wherever they like in accordance with the rules, but they usually use the courthouse because that's where they keep their stuff.

Your employer can go to jail for this, and having a limited liability company won't protect them.Bad news for you: You have to pay your taxes. In your example, the inland revenue should realise that your income wasn't $40,000 with $10,000 taxes subtracted, but you were only paid $30,000 so in the worst case you might have to pay the taxes for $30,000."}
{"question":"Today there was an article on CNN about some kind of employee abuse case that referred to attempting arbitration. I couldn't find the article again to link to it but I found a lot more references to it.The most interesting one seems to be this page from lexology where the summary of a US Supreme Court ruling seems to believe that the court believes that arbitration is something that can fail to resolve an issue. A 'stay of trial proceedings until they have had a chance to attempt arbitration' doesn't seem to read as though they expect it to work reliably.The court can't really be talking about the remote possability that the arbitrators don't take the case, nor the remoter probability of failing to remain an arbitrator long enough to finish it. Mind boggles.","answer":"First of all, it doesn't seem to be a question of whether the court 'believes' that arbitration can fail.  The phrase 'attempt arbitration' isn't from the  (the case is ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. CARLISLE (No. 08-146)521 F. 3d 597); indeed, the word 'attempt' doesn't appear there at all.'Attempt arbitration' is from the article's author (Lynn Hawkins) explaining the provisions of Section 3 of the ).So in this case, I think 'attempt' alludes to the notion that Alice has to at least 'try' arbitration, and see whether she likes it, before moving ahead with her lawsuit.   'Success' and 'failure' are from Alice's point of view; 'success' is a decision she likes, 'failure' is one that she doesn't like."}
{"question":"The case involed two ex lovers (one supposedly ex-lesbin) arguing about who gets custody of their adopted daughter. The ex-lesbian had several affidavits written up from suppoters saying her ex abused their daughter, seen here: However according to the case files only one (Tammara Canfield) was seen in the hearings. (see here: )Why were the other affidavits not used? ","answer":"On page 18 of the appellate decision linked above, it says:  Finding of Fact No. 60: Ms. Miller has no justification for denying parent-child  contact between Ms. Jenkins and IMJ. .    Lisa's lawyers assert that this finding is erroneous because: (1) the court  disregarded testimony that IMJ engaged in frightening behavior after her visits with  Janet; (2) Janet disagrees with Lisa's and IMJ's religious beliefs; and (3) the court failed to receive evidence that Janet exposed IMJ to the homosexual lifestyle, which is  documented to be emotionally, psychologically, and physically unhealthy. (Plaintiff-  Appellant's Brief, pp. 21-22). The simple fact is that Lisa's extra-legal justifications for her contemptuous conduct do not change the fact that Lisa has no legal justification for non-compliance.This indicates that Lisa's law errs allege, after the fact, that certain evidence was not received by the family court, but  the appellate court simply holds that such evidence was not relevant to the issue of finding of fact #60On page 21 of the appellate decision it says:  Finding of Fact No. 79: There is no evidence of abuse of IMJ by either Ms. Miller  or Ms. Jenkins. .    This statement is a truism. There was absolutely no evidence introduced at the  August 21, 2009 hearing as to any abuse or allegations of abuse by either of the parties;  and Lisa's lawyers do not suggest otherwise. (Plaintiff-Appellant's Brief, pp. 20-21).  Rather, they point to a 2007 affidavit of Tammara Canfield that they have placed in the  Printed Case but which was not before the court at the 2009 hearing. (Id., p. 21; PC 136-  137).    Furthermore, this Court would have to look further back into the history of this  case well before the August, 2009 hearing to even find allegations of abuse much less  evidence of it. The only live testimony presented at the August, 2009 hearing was by  Janet, Janet's mother Ruth Jenkins, expert witness Jan Tyler, and Kimberly Izzo, a client  of Janet's. None of the witnesses testified that any family members had abused IMJ and  Lisa points to no record evidence from the hearing in support of her argument. To the extent Lisa's affidavit contained any allegations of abuse, the judge acted well within  his discretion to assess the validity of the allegations and reject them as unsupportedIt would seem that the Canfield  affidavit was not introduced at the Family Court hering but only afterwards, and that other statements did not contain anything that the Family Court or the appellate  court considered to be evidence of abuse.There is no way on the information in the question to know why this affidavit  (and possibly others) was not submitted at the time of the relevant hearing."}
{"question":"This question seems hard to google, since all the results are about people born in US embassies on foreign soil.I'm wondering about the situation where someone's born in, say, the French embassy in Washington, DC.I know there are limits to the extraterritoriality of embassies, but I don't know if this is one of them.","answer":"Immigration and naturalization is pretty far out of my comfort zone, but I'm confident that the answer is yes.Although people often believe that a foreign embassy is considered the territory of that country, I don't know of any law that supports that belief. Instead, through the , the embassy grounds remain the territory of the host state but are provided a variety of protections and immunities because of their diplomatic status. With the embassy on U.S. soil, the child would therefore satisfy the 'born ... in the United States' prong of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause.*But that would not be the end of the analysis, as birthright citizenship also requires not just that the child is born in the United States, but also that the child be 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' So if the child were born to an American citizen who had entered the Indian embassy to get a travel visa, the child would be both born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction, making it eligible for birthright citizenship. But if the child were born to Indian ambassador or to diplomatic staff, who would generally be able to claim diplomatic immunity, that child would not be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and would not be able to claim birthright citizenship.  ('The phrase, subject to its jurisdiction' was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign States born within the United States.').* I haven't been able to find any cases saying this explicitly, but all the cases involving children born in foreign embassies sort of skip over the question as though they just assume that the child was born in the United States. See, e.g.,  These cases also go on to conclude that those children are not citizens of the United States, because they are not 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'"}
{"question":"If police seize property that is not on a warrant are they basically stealing from you? What is your recourse if this is to happen? Can you make a case of theft against the police or is there nothing else to do but to start a  suit?","answer":"Police liability under state law has meaningful variation from state to state.Most prominently, one could seek to regain possession of property unlawfully taken that belongs to the person bringing suit by some means or another, although the procedural framework for doing so varies quite a bit from state to state and can be quite arcane. This can't be done, however, of course, in the case of contraband (e.g. if cocaine is seized in a search made without a search warrant where a search warrant should have been required).It is also generally in almost every jurisdiction in the U.S. some sort of state law crime for law enforcement officers to take property for personal use from a private citizen.There are three main theories under federal law:A suit under Section 1983 for an intentional violation of a well established constitution right by a state and local government official.A Bivens lawsuit for an intentional violation of selected well established constitutional rights by federal government officials.A reverse takings clause lawsuit (also called an inverse condemnation action) against the entity that employs a government official alleging that property was taken without due process of law and without justice compensation - but this is limited by a police power exception in most cases where the action can be colorable tied to a legitimate use of police powers."}
{"question":"Assume that the complainant has sufficient proof of racial discrimination in their workplace, and wishes to have it investigated.What is the regular course of action in such case in the United States?From reading the , my understanding is that:The complainant writes a claim to the Commission on Equal Employment Opportunity (Title VII, Sec 706(a))The commission mediates to resolve the matter informally, which may take up to 30 days (Titile VII, Sec 706(a)).Let's say that the mediation doesn't succeed to achieve voluntary compliance satisfactory to both sides.

What is a likely punishment?Why is the process convoluted by adding an extra step in form of the commission?Why isn't discrimination simply prosecuted by the state's attorney? After all racial discrimination very much fits the definition of a public wrong.Is the enforcement any good?","answer":"  Let's say that the mediation doesn't succeed to achieve voluntary  compliance satisfactory to both sides. What happens next? Under Sec  706(e) it appears that the complainant has to litigate himself in a  civil court, and potentially be exempt from any fees and have an  appointed attorney.Not really. The EEOC at that point (within a certain time period) either decides to litigate the case itself, or if it chooses not to litigate itself, authorizes the employee to litigate the case at his or her own expense, and if the employee prevails, the remedy awarded by the Court includes what the court determines to be the employees reasonable attorneys' fees.The details of the process and the relevant deadlines are available . Basically, if the case isn't resolved in mediation, the employer makes a position statement, the employee responds, the EEOC investigates (using its subpoena power, if necessary) on average for ten months, and the EEOC either prosecutes the case itself, or it issues a 'Notice-Of-Right-To-Sue' which allows the private employee to hire a lawyer and sue the employer.  How often does it actually happen?The EEOC handles . The rest settle before trial or are resolved in motion practice before trial (including default judgments, when the employer simply doesn't respond to the lawsuit). Once the EEOC brings a lawsuit, settlement is the most common resolution.So, there are a lot of cases, although there is only about one EEOC claim per 1,000 employees in the workforce subject to EEOC jurisdiction per year. Whether this is a lot of complaints or not many, is really a matter of opinion. Only about one in twenty-five people will ever file an EEOC claim in his or her entire life, although this will vary considerably based upon a person's race, national origin, religion and sex. A non-Hispanic white Christian male of European descent is much less likely to file an EEOC claim during his lifetime than someone who does not fit that description.Realistically, a majority of cases that aren't abandoned by the employee in the administrative process (which is a significant share of the total) or found to have no factual basis (a small but significant percentage) are settled for fairly modest dollar amounts (an average of about $10,000 to $20,000 per claim). The bigger dollar cases for a single employee usually end up being brought in a private lawsuit rather than by the EEOC itself.About  (not quite 2%) go to trial each year. The rest settled or are resolved in motion practice before trial (including default judgments, when the employer simply doesn't respond to the lawsuit). Once an employee brings a lawsuit, settlement is the most common resolution. Folk wisdom in the employment litigation field is that the average settlement of a case of ordinary strength on the merits that is settled fairly early on in the process is about six months of wages.An estimate that the employees in private lawsuits secured more than $200 million a year in settlements and money judgments is probably a gross underestimate. It could easily be $500 million to $1 billion per year. But, there are no good statistics available since settlement amounts are overwhelmingly confidential.The EEOC sues on behalf of the employee in cases it chooses to litigate itself on a weekly basis, and likewise declines to prosecute and certifies the case to allow the individual to prosecute the case with a private attorney all the time.   Is there any relevant case law?Yes.Pretty much every relevant detail of the process has been litigated in case law that has produced reported decisions because there have been many thousands of employment discrimination cases litigated under the Act. There are probably at least two dozen to four dozen new published appellate decisions in the federal circuit courts each year on these kinds of cases, if not more, and those decisions have come at a pretty steady rate for the past half century. There are hundreds of published decisions interpreting these statutes in almost every one of the federal circuits.On quite a few issues, there are splits of authority between different circuits regarding how to interpret the law that will ultimately be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court, or by Congress, or that may remain unresolved forever.  How will the civil court try the case? Will the judge reference the  Civil Rights Directly?It is a little unclear what you are asking here, but I will do my best.Regardless of whether the EEOC or the individual employee brings the case, it is filed as a Complaint in federal court like any other federal lawsuit, litigated according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and resolved in the vast majority of cases either by a judge in a pre-trial motion, by a settlement between the parties, or by a jury trial presided over by a judge.In a jury trial, the judge tells the jury what the applicable law says and the jury decides if the employee has proved a case against the employer when applying that law after hearing the evidence presented at trial and then decides what damages award to make, on a very short jury verdict form.In a bench trial (i.e before a judge without a jury), the judge makes those determinations in a lengthy written ruling setting forth the factual and legal basis for the judge's determination on the merits.Jury trials are much more common than bench trials in these kinds of cases, partially because plaintiffs want juries to make a damages determination, and partially out of a perception (not entirely inaccurate) that judges tend to be pro-employer on average.  What is a likely punishment?Punishment is mostly the wrong term. It is a lawsuit for money damages to compensate the employee for harm actually suffered. The jury (or the judge if the case can be decided before trial in a motion for summary judgment or if a jury trial has been waived) determines the amount of compensation, if any, which should be awarded for lost wages, non-economic compensatory damages, etc. and the judge then awards attorneys' fees and court costs based upon the submissions of the parties after the trial is over based upon a determination of what is allowed by law and what is reasonable.To some extent, an employer's obligation to pay attorneys' fees and costs acts as a proportionate punishment for not immediately settling a case where the employer is found to be in the wrong. To some extent, non-economic damages can constitute a punishment.But, when an employer is found to have discriminated intentionally, which is most of the time,  based upon the size of the employer.  Why is the process convoluted by adding an extra step in form of the  commission?Mediation is allowed as a compromise to encourage negotiated resolutions that avoid litigation costs before everyone has spent a lot of money on lawyers. In practice, a surprisingly large number of cases result in pre-trial mediation resolutions, often in cases where an outcome if the case had gone forward to a trial would have been uncertain.The involvement of the Commission is a compromise between having a system where all cases are prosecuted at state expenses and one in which all cases are brought privately with an opportunity to win attorneys' fees if one prevails. The EEOC has usually used its authority to bring cases that are clearly cases of improper employer conduct where due to the small dollar amounts involved or the number of employees affected, an individual lawsuit would not provide an adequate remedy since private lawsuits would not be brought otherwise. It is very hard for a private attorney to justify bringing an employment discrimination lawsuit over a case where the damages are likely to be in the $5,000 to $25,000 range because the employee doesn't make much money unless liability is 100% clear (e.g. there is an admission on videotape from the employer), despite the fact that a prevailing party can get non-economic damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees and costs. So, it is particularly hard to bring employment discrimination cases on behalf of employees who don't earn much even when they aren't discriminated against. The availability of EEOC enforcement prevents employers of low wage workers and workers in temporary employment whose damages are small from ignoring the Civil Rights laws with impunity.A private lawyer does something on the order of $30,000 to $150,000 of billable work to bring an employment discrimination case involving a single employee-client to trial, and a lawyer defending such a case for an employer will typically incur more legal fees for their employer client than the employee's lawyers do, while the employer's lawyer defends the case all of the way through a trial, even before considering any amounts actually awarded to a prevailing employee in a case where the employee wins. Each side's legal fees, individually, will usually exceed the amount of compensatory and punitive damages awarded combined in a fairly small dollar case for an employee who wasn't paid very much, or at least didn't lose a huge amount of money economically due to illegal discrimination (for example, because the employee wasn't promoted while a less qualified candidate was promoted). This is an important reason why lots of cases settle and why the EEOC is necessary.The EEOC process also provides a means by which arbitration agreements with individual employees can be circumvented because the EEOC is not a party to those agreements and is not bound by them.  Why isn't discrimination simply prosecuted by the state's attorney?  After all racial discrimination very much fits the definition of a  public wrong.Government agency resources aren't unlimited, so the government can't prosecute every credible complaint, so the EEOC has to pick and choose how to get the most bang for its available resources. In practice, the EEOC can only afford to pursue about one in ten of the employment discrimination cases subject to its jurisdiction that go to trial with its own lawyers. The cases it can't afford to bring, it delegates to the private sector rather than simply leaving those cases unprosecuted as would happen in the criminal justice system.This also provides a way for an employee who has a lazy or unenthusiastic government lawyer assigned to their case at the EEOC who doesn't take what the employee sees as a strong case seriously a way to get relief for employment discrimination despite the fact that the EEOC isn't willing to back them up. Private lawsuits are a check and balance against bad EEOC decisions about how strong cases are as well as a way for the EEOC to avoid financing the legal fees of people who can afford to sue on their own.  Is the enforcement any good?Lots of employees over the years have gotten lots of money, although probably not 100% of the amount of the economic harm they suffered (and, of course, employee and employer attorneys have gotten paid a lot of money in the process as well, which is good if you are a lawyer, but is dead weight loss from an economist's point of view). But, more importantly, the behavior of employers has changed greatly as a result.In practice, most lawsuits, and almost all lawsuits not brought by the EEOC itself, involve either wrongful termination or failure to promote someone, rather than discriminatory hiring, since it is hard to show an individual right to be hired for which an individual is entitled to compensation.Even in EEOC cases, most are brought for discriminatory advertising or openly admitted discrimination in hiring, rather than covert discrimination by an employer in hiring on a non-permitted basis. The EEOC brings a handful of cases alleging covert discrimination in hiring against medium or large employers each year, in part, just to provide a credible threat to anyone considering doing so, often with a combination of tips from insiders (particularly those from hiring officials who are fired in retaliation for not following a discriminatory hiring policy) and with undercover 'test applicants' who submit functionally identical resumes for the same job when many job openings are available. But, this is usually a tiny share of the total volume of employment litigation brought under the Civil Rights Acts.There is a certain irony in this, because employers who are willing to hire someone who belongs to a 'protected class' in the first place, who hence, are probably not the most discriminatory employers in the market, are more exposed to a realistic risk of a discrimination lawsuit, than employers who refuse to hire anyone in a 'protected class' in the first place, so long as the employer keeps its mouth shut about this practice and is willing to lie and come up with false pretexts for its actions. Dishonest gross racists and clear misogynists are under punished, while less culpable employers who are more honest but still a little bit discriminatory in the cases of a few well paid employees are over punished relative to more culpable employers.Also, employment discrimination laws provide the most monetary compensation to the most competent and well paid employees who probably have the greatest capacity to mitigate their damages by seeking other employment from less discriminatory employers, while providing the least compensation to the marginal employees for whom discrimination in employment most impacts their quality of life. Indeed, often the most marginal employees aren't even willing to risk filing a complaint with the EEOC for fear of being blacklisted in the future in a manner that is impossible to prove.Still, at a minimum, by making it illegal to publicly state a discriminatory reason or to state a discriminatory reason to someone who could testify against you in court, the laws in question have changed the internal normative standards that managers of medium and large sized business apply on a day to day business such that at least lip service and public commitment is given to the requirements of the civil rights laws. This change in corporate culture has probably had more of a real world effect than actual suits for damages have in regard to discrimination in hiring. The benefits of the voluntarily discontinuation of discrimination in employment as employers internalized the norms established by the civil rights laws for the most part has provided far more benefit to employees who were previously discriminated against than litigation and settlements resulting from the EEOC process.For example, when Sandra Day O'Connor (future Supreme Court justice) was a young lawyer, fewer than 5% of attorneys were women and she was often mistaken for a secretary or receptionist by clients. Now, about half of all young associate lawyers (even at very large firms who graduated from very prestigious law schools) are women. Almost all of this change was due to a change in professional norms that were a direct result of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (women had legally been allowed to be lawyers since the 1920s almost everywhere and earlier in some places), rather than through case by case litigation. The Civil Right Act opened up a huge new lucrative profession to women and minorities, and the experience of the legal profession was the norm and not the exception. Before the act, women were pretty much limited to school teaching, being librarians, nursing, secretary work, food service, day care, piece work sewing and laundry work. After the Civil Rights Act, their employment opportunities dramatically increased. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is likewise, more or less single handedly, responsible for today's black middle class which would have been an order of magnitude smaller otherwise.There are economic arguments that discrimination laws do or do not do much good, but those arguments rarely consider the fact that the law, when it was first enacted, dramatically changed corporate culture and the moral viewpoints and norms of the middle and upper middle class who act as employers making hiring decisions across the nation. Until the Civil Rights Act was enacted, tradition and prejudice kept a huge share of the population out of most of the marketplace in a manner completely contrary to what a naive Economics 101 analysis would predict."}

{"question":"Insurance companies use 'float' money taken in from premiums. Even though it is not their cash they invest it as long as when needed they can pay a customer claim. Could a non-insurance company that gets funds from customers for holding then create a similar scheme to use these funds for investment as long as they have the funds available when the customer needs them. I would believe the company would have to have full disclosure but if they do, is that possible within the scope of U.S. law?","answer":"Any businesses that takes payment in advance can use that money as they see fit, there is nothing special about insurance companies. Airlines, travel agents and construction companies are all examples of businesses that routinely take deposits.What you describe is actually a common business model: it's called banking. Banks take deposits and invest the money (usually through loans).There are some businesses that are required by law to hold funds in trust but these are the exceptions rather than the rule."}
{"question":"In the US many sushi places sell \"white tuna\" which actually isn't a Tuna at all but Escolar, a fish from a different family and genus. That seems to be primarily a popular marketing ploy: Tuna is substantially more expensive than Escolar. It also doesn't remotely taste like tuna either. The practice is akin to selling chicken as \"white beef\" at beef prices.Is is not only is it grossly misleading, it is also potentially dangerous. Escolar is banned in (for example) Japan and Italy because they consider it toxic. Being banned in Japan is particularly ironic for a Sushi fish. Anyway: Tuna is much less of a health risk than Escolar.Is this legal or what is the legal interpretation of this mislabeling?What legal recourse does a customer have if they come across it?If locality matters, let's start with US, Massachusetts.","answer":"Federal deceptive advertising regulations do not apply to restaurant menus, and sale of escolar is legal in the US. Legal recourse would have to be via state law. Such legal action is conceivable, for example it would be &quot;menu fraud&quot; to sell chuck steak as &quot;Kobe beef&quot;, and the practice of selling shark meat disks as scallops is likewise illegal. Fish are problematic since multiple species can be commonly called by a single name (sole, halibut, cod, snapper, sardine, herring). It is possible that in a certain market, &quot;white tuna&quot; is standardly understood to be albacore tuna, therefore it would be fraudulent to sell escolar as &quot;white tuna&quot;. That would be the point that has to be proven in a legal action, that the term has a specific interpretation. Analogously, there are a number of creamed vegetable products sold as &quot;hummus&quot; which contain no chickpeas (by original definition, hummus is chickpeas and not soybeans). By dint of such variant use over time, it is not deceptive to sell mashed soybeans as &quot;hummus&quot;. The tuna industry may well hope to limit the use of the term &quot;tuna&quot;, but there is no regulation defining &quot;white tuna&quot;. It should be noted that there is a regulation,  for canned tuna, dictating that only albacore tuna maybe called &quot;white meat tuna&quot;."}

{"question":"This is a question out of curiosity only, indirectly inspired by my  post. I'm wondering at what point not reporting a crime is itself a crime.I know that if someone happens to witness a bar fight and doesn't immediately call the cops they are not guilty of a crime (or I assume they aren't, unless they're technically guilty and simply never prosecuted for it).  This implies that the refusal to report a crime is not, by itself, a crime.However, I'm also pretty sure if, for example, a women knows her boyfriend is sexually assaulting their child and turns a blind eye to it she can be convicted as an accomplice to the crime.  Likewise, I think if you're riding in the car with someone who does a hit and run you are required to report it or be an accomplice.So I'm wondering where this line is drawn.  At what point does one's involvement become such that they are guilty simply for failing to report another individual, assuming they have not actively done anything to directly support the crime otherwise?Furthermore, if someone is indirectly benefiting from a crime they do not encourage or facilitate \u2013 for instance a wife getting a new fur coat after her husband robs a bank despite her not approving of the husband's actions \u2013 does this make her an accomplice?  Is there a line here to draw, presumably a bar serving a drink to someone they know is a bookie doesn't make them guilty, even if the bookie presumably earned the money he is using to buy the drink via an illegal job?","answer":"TL;DRNever; unless there is a specific law in the jurisdiction that requires it, however, that is a separate crime, it doesn't make you an accomplice to the first crime.There is no general obligation to report a crime; some jurisdictions may have legislated to make reporting mandatory, either generally or for specific professions.From the link, an accomplice is:One who knowingly, voluntarily, and with common intent unites with the principal offender in the commission of a crime. One who is in some way concerned or associated in commission of crime; partaker of guilt; one who aids or assists, or is an Accessory. One who is guilty of complicity in crime charged, either by being present and aiding or abetting in it, or having advised and encouraged it, though absent from place when it was committed, though mere presence, Acquiescence, or silence, in the absence of a duty to act, is not enough, no matter how reprehensible it may be, to constitute one an accomplice. One is liable as an accomplice to the crime of another if he or she gave assistance or encouragement or failed to perform a legal duty to prevent it with the intent thereby to promote or facilitate commission of the crime.Mandatory ReportingMany jurisdictions impose an obligation on certain professions to report suspected crimes. The most common and obvious being a police officer who generally has an obligation to report all suspected crimes. Other professions include doctors, teachers, nurses etc. in the case of suspected child abuse; sometimes this extends to elder abuse but usually doesn't include an obligation to report spousal abuse.If a person with such an obligation fails to report, they have not become an accomplice to the original crime or any future crime; they have broken a different law on their own.General consequencesIn general, a witness to a crime is not required to report it. They could be asked to give a statement but are not obliged to and would not be subject to arrest. If they were subpoenaed to appear in court as a witness then they would be obliged to do so and give evidence; failure to do either would be contempt of court.To be clear, a perpetrator of a crime is also not obliged to report it and is protected from contempt by rules about self-incrimination like the US Fifth Amendment. As an aside, NSW, Australia has recently passed a law that while maintaining the accused's right not to testify has allowed juries and judges to draw inference from the silence in their deliberations.Specific LawsSome jurisdictions have specific laws that make it a crime not to report. For example, in New South Wales, Australia Section  requires permission of the Attorney General.PrivilegeA person may become aware of a crime through disclosure as part of a professional-client relationship. Such disclosures may be subject to privilege.At common law, only the lawyer-client relationship is legally privileged meaning that a lawyer cannot disclose what their client has said to them. This does not cover advice on committing or covering up a crime - if a lawyer does this there is no privilege and the lawyer may become an accomplice.Closely related is the litigation privilege where communications prepared as part of litigation (including criminal prosecutions) are protected even if they are not between the lawyer and the client.Some jurisdictions have statutorily extended this privilege to other relationships: doctor-patient, priest-confessor, pastor-parishioner, accountant-client, psychologist-patient etc. Check your local guides.Your examplesThe bar fight witness has no obligation to report and is not an accomplice. In NSW, this is the crime of , a serious indictable offence, and must be reported.The mother of the child has no obligation to report and, unless she is assisting or encouraging the commission of the sexual assault, is not an accomplice. Further, spousal testimonial privilege does not apply; i.e. the mother could be compelled to give evidence against the boyfriend or face contempt. In NSW, this is the crime of , a serious indictable offence, and must be reported.The passenger has no obligation to report and is not an accomplice. In NSW, this is the crime of , a serious indictable offence, and must be reported.Sub-questionsAt what point does one's involvement become such that they are guilty simply for failing to report another individual, assuming they have not actively done anything to directly support the crime otherwise?At the point where the person moves from being a witness to a participant by assisting or encouraging the perpetrator.... if someone is indirectly benefiting from a crime they do not encourage or facilitate, ..., does this make them an accomplice?No, however, if the person knows that the benefit are the proceeds of crime then they could be charged with receiving stolen property and would not have good title in the property even if they didn't know.presumably a bar serving a drink to someone they know is a bookie doesn't make them guilty, even if the bookie presumably earned the money he is using to buy the drink via an illegal job?It depends if they know the money is the proceeds of crime; if they do then receiving it is a crime in its own right but it doesn't make them an accomplice."}

{"question":"Suppose the Police obtain a warrant to search Alice's house for smuggled diamonds (something really tiny). When they arrive, they knock on Bob's door instead of Alice's. It's a common mistake to make, and each new mailman has made it. Case 1:Bob is not home. The police search the place and find tons of (illegal item). When Bob returns, they arrest him. Case 2:Bob is home. He looks at the warrant, and informs the officers they are at the wrong house. The officers do not believe Bob, and think he's just trying to get them to go away. They search over his objections, find the (illegal thing) and arrest him.  shows that criminals are always at risk of being busted on unrelated but lawful law enforcement activities, but it seems to me that Bob's 4th amendment right was violated since the officers did not have a warrant to search his house. Is the evidence the officers found at Bob's house admissible?Jurisdiction is USA. ","answer":"The Evidence Would be Admissible.Under the so-called &quot;good faith exception&quot; to the exclusionary rule the evidence would probably be admitted over Bob's objections in both cases mentioned in the question. Recent US court decisions have limited the exclusionary rule when police officers reasonably but mistakenly believe  that a valid warrant exists, and find evidence acting under such an apparent warrant. However, if there is good evidence of intentional falsification by the police, the exception will probably not apply.As to the second case, where Bob is home and protests that an error is being made, police are not required to, and often do not, accept much that suspects or subjects of warrants say in their own defense. If anyone could simply claim there was an error and delay a warrant, perhaps giving time to dispose of evidence, many problems would result.However, the &quot;good faith&quot; exception only applies where the police reasonably and honestly believe that the warrant is valid, or that probable cause exists. If Bob says something such as:This warrant is for 1020 Anne street, where Alice Crook lives. But I live at 1050 Albert street. See the house number is 1050 right here. There must be a mistake.then a reasonable officer would probably double check the warrant, and if the officer unreasonably fails to do so, the search might later be suppressed. But this is going to be a very fact-sensitive inquiry, and none of the cases that I know of on the &quot;good faith exception&quot; rule are exactly on point for this situation. I cannot be sure how a court might rule in such a case.<h3>Leon and Evans Cases<\/h3>In , the US Supreme Court created a &quot;good faith exception&quot; to the exclusionary rule. In that case the Court held that when officers make an objectively reasonable, good faith decision to rely on a warrant later held to be invalid, the exclusionary rule does not apply, and evidence found during a search under such a warrant, or in the course of an arrest under such a warren, is admissible. The basic logic is that when the invalid warrant was the result of an honest mistake, suppressing the evidence would have no deterrent effect on future similar mistakes, as no one intended to make them in any case.In , this rule was extended to officer who rely in good faith on information mistakenly provided by Court employees. The underlying logic is much the same.<h3>Herring v. United States<\/h3>In  this exception was further extended to officers who acted in good faith on the mistaken information of other officers. Evidence found in a search incident to an arrest, although there was no valid arrest warrant or other probable cause,  was not suppressed. In this case a warrant had been issued but later recalled. however this recall was somehow not properly entered into the database of warrants maintained by a sheriff's office. When a nearby jurisdiction called to ask if there was an outstanding warrant on Herring, they were told that there was one. Herring was arrested, and drugs and an unlawful firearm found. Minutes later the officers were told that the arrest warrant was not valid. Herring was convicted based on the evidence from the search, and the US Supreme court upheld the conviction.The court wrote in Herring:When a probable-cause determination was based on reasonable but mistaken assumptions, the person subjected to a search or seizure has not necessarily been the victim of a constitutional violation. The very phrase probable cause confirms that the Fourth Amendment does not demand all possible precision. And whether the error can be traced to a mistake by a state actor or some other source may bear on the analysis. For purposes of deciding this case, however, we accept the parties' assumption that there was a Fourth Amendment violation. The issue is whether the exclusionary rule should be applied.The fact that a Fourth Amendment violation occurredi.e., that a search or arrest was unreasonabledoes not necessarily mean that the exclusionary rule applies. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 223 (1983). Indeed, exclusion has always been our last resort, not our first impulse, Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U. S. 586, 591 (2006), and our precedents establish important principles that constrain application of the exclusionary rule....the exclusionary rule is not an individual right and applies only where it  result[s] in appreciable deterrence.'...When police act under a warrant that is invalid for lack of probable cause, the exclusionary rule does not apply if the police acted in objectively reasonable reliance on the subsequently invalidated search warrant. 468 U. S., at 922 (Leon). We (perhaps confusingly) called this objectively reasonable reliance good faith.  In a companion case, Massachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U. S. 981 (1984), we held that the exclusionary rule did not apply when a warrant was invalid because a judge forgot to make clerical corrections to it....in Evans, 514 U. S. 1, we applied this good-faith rule to police who reasonably relied on mistaken information in a court's database that an arrest warrant was outstanding. We held that a mistake made by a judicial employee could not give rise to exclusion for three reasons: The exclusionary rule was crafted to curb police rather than judicial misconduct; court employees were unlikely to try to subvert the Fourth Amendment; and most important, there [was] no basis for believing that application of the exclusionary rule in [those] circumstances would have any significant effect in deterring the errors...the abuses that gave rise to the exclusionary rule featured intentional conduct that was patently unconstitutional ......To trigger the exclusionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system....In Franks v. Delaware, 438 U. S. 154 (1978), ... we held that police negligence in obtaining a warrant did not even rise to the level of a Fourth Amendment violation, let alone meet the more stringent test for triggering the exclusionary rule....We do not suggest that all recordkeeping errors by the police are immune from the exclusionary rule. In this case, however, the conduct at issue was not so objectively culpable as to require exclusion. In Leon we held that the marginal or nonexistent benefits produced by suppressing evidence obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated search warrant cannot justify the substantial costs of exclusion. 468 U. S., at 922. The same is true when evidence is obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently recalled warrant.If the police have been shown to be reckless in maintaining a warrant system, or to have knowingly made false entries to lay the groundwork for future false arrests, exclusion would certainly be justified under our cases should such misconduct cause a Fourth Amendment violation.See "}
{"question":"I have a friend who's tried to commit suicide a couple of times. He works at a fast food franchise that insists on scheduling him during the only time he can go visit with a counselor.I know FMLA only requires places with 50 or more employees - do franchises bypass this requirement? And if not, does the FMLA protect visits for mental health reasons?We're in Arkansas if that makes any difference.","answer":"Arkansas does not appear to have its own version of the FMLA. Whether or not the FMLA applies to your friend's employer is a complex question related to other local businesses that may or may not be integrated with the franchise within which he works. It would require the knowledge of a local labor attorney and knowledge of the business structure of the franchisee to make a determination. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA - ) applies to employers with 50 or more employees within 75 miles of the employee's worksite.Generally, franchise operations are independent businesses and the individual business would need to meet the employee count threshold for its employees to be covered.However, there is the concept of an 'integrated employer.' The Labor Department sometimes groups smaller businesses as an integrated employer and this will cause the FMLA to apply to seemingly independent businesses with fewer than 50 employees.The Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division  to determine if the businesses are integrated:    interrelation of operations, i.e., common offices, common record keeping, shared bank accounts and equipment;  common management, common directors and boards;  centralized control of labor relations and personnel, i.e., hire and fire employees; and,  common ownership and financial control  They further state:  A determination of whether or not separate entities are an integrated  employer is not determined by the application of any single criterion,  but rather the entire relationship is to be reviewed in its totality.  All four criteria need not be present in all cases, but the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission, which administers the Civil Rights  Act, considers the first three criteria to be the most important, with  centralized control of labor relations to be most critical of these  three.A fast food franchise would not be subject to FMLA regulations because the franchisor is a large company. However, many fast food franchises are part of larger, local businesses such as restaurant groups that may be subject to the regulations.An example of this would be Christopher Harold who owned Sofono, Inc, a company established to own three Domino's Pizza franchises. In Cousin v. Sofono, an employee sued to recognize that the FMLA applied to these businesses because they were an 'integrated employer.' There is an article in .Whether or not the fast food franchise where your friend works would qualify as an integrated employer with other fast food franchises is subject to an examination of the business structure of the individual employers. If the franchise is truly a stand-alone business with fewer than 50 employees then the FMLA would not apply. In the case of the Domino's pizza franchise they were deemed to be integrated because they were the same franchise licensees of the same franchisor (Domino's) and they had a common workers' comp policy.Do be aware that the 50 employee limit is not a permanent employee threshold. From :  A private-sector employer is covered by the FMLA if it employs 50 or  more employees in 20 or more workweeks in the current or previous  calendar year.The example they give in the guide is an employer that hires temporary, seasonal workers causing the employer to qualify under FMLA.The integrated employer test and how to count employees can be found in the ."}

{"question":"TL;DR: Can an HOA force homeowners to pay a large 1-time fee for installation of a street gate and increased monthly fees for road maintenance on the private road that is already in the process of being dedicated to the county?I live in a new affordable housing community with the majority of the homes classified under various affordable and . None of these houses (roughly 1\/3 of the total) are completed yet.  All of the 'open market' and 'workforce' housing has been built and is occupied -- about 2\/3 of the total lots included in the HOA.We are located on a single road that connects a much older neighborhood to the main highway.  This is an alternate (and possibly quicker) route for northbound traffic from this older neighborhood.  The road was only recently built and was submitted for dedication to the county, but the process is not complete yet.The HOA board wishes to keep the road private and build a gate blocking access to\/from the older neighborhood.  They wish to charge every homeowner a 1-time fee to build the gate and to start a reserve fund to pay for future road maintenance (which will show up in our monthly HOA fees).  Is this legal?  Can they charge us a 1-time fee for improvement projects?  What type of approval if any is required of the homeowners? We were told that the road was being dedicated to the county when we bought the homes. Do we have any recourse to prevent the HOA from 'privatizing' the road (actually, they are try to prevent the road from being dedicated rather than actually privatizing the road)?","answer":"This would depend on the detailed terms of the governing documents of the HOA. Some HOA declarations authorize the HOA board to make expenditures needed for maintenance (which can itself be quite expensive), but require a vote of the full membership for capital improvements. A gate would arguably be a capital improvement, but your HOA may not have that limitation in its governing documents.In general when you buy or lease a property governed by an HOA you sign a contract agreeing that you are bound by the governing documents of the HOA. This is because you will sharing resources with the other members which must be maintained in common. Take this seriously! An HOA can wield considerable power over your property, and can impose significant financial obligations on you.If you disagree with the way the board is running the HOA, you may want to stand for the board yourself."}
{"question":"This is specifically with regards to speakers invited to a university campus. Hypothetical situation:University A (for some period of time greater than an academic year) invites only anti-police, pro-immigrant, pro-choice etc. speakers to their campus.Question:Is there any legislation (federal, state) preventing a university from doing this?","answer":"I have worked at public and semi-public universities in three states and never heard of any such law.  I think most institutions would view such a law as an infringement on academic freedom, and push back against it.Of course, there is usually some level of oversight by the state government: e.g. governor appoints board of trustees, who appoint university president, etc,.  So if the government thought there was excessive bias, they could exert pressure in a variety of ways.  But I haven't heard of this being at the level of legislation.For a private non-profit university, if it got really extreme, the IRS might decide that the organization's purpose had become political rather than educational, and they could revoke their tax-exempt status.  I haven't heard of this ever actually happening.Note also that it's a bit misleading to speak of 'a university inviting a speaker'.  Except in very high-profile cases, most guest speakers who visit a university are invited by individual faculty or departments, student organizations, etc.  If they are paid or reimbursed for travel expenses, these costs usually come out of discretionary funds controlled by the department or club, which may have originally come from private donations, etc; not necessarily tax dollars.  It's all very decentralized and high-level university administration is rarely involved in such decisions.

MD  provides:  (a) In this Section, 'loiter' means for a person to:    (1) Remain on a public street, sidewalk, or pathway, including one privately-owned but used by the public in general, so as to obstruct the free passage of a pedestrian or vehicle after a regular or special police officer has notified the person that the action is unlawful and has requested the person to move;    (2) Remain in or on a vehicle on a public street, sidewalk, or pathway, including one privately-owned but used by the public in general, so as to obstruct the free passage of a pedestrian or vehicle after a regular or special police officer has notified the person that the action is unlawful and has requested the person to move;    (3) Refuse or fail to leave a private business, commercial establishment, or parking lot that is posted with conspicuous 'No Loitering' signs if the business or establishment is not open for business, and the person has been requested to leave by the owner, the owner's agent, or a regular or special police officer, unless the person:        (A) Has written permission from the owner, lessee, or operator to be present; or        (B) Is window-shopping under conditions and at a time of the day or night that would be considered conducive to that activity;      (4) Refuse or fail to leave a private business or commercial establishment that is open for business, or a parking lot of the business or establishment, after having been requested to do so by the owner or the owner's agent;    (5) Refuse or fail to leave a public building, public grounds, or a public recreational area, or a parking lot of a public building, public grounds, or a public recreational area, after being requested to do so by a regular or special police officer or by a regularly employed guard, watchman, or other authorized employee of the agency or institution responsible for the public building, public grounds, recreational area, or parking lot if the circumstances indicate that the person has no apparent lawful business or purpose to pursue at that place;(and so on)I do find that at one time New York state (and some other states) had an  which  required all men between the ages of 18 and 50 to be habitually and regularly engaged in some lawful, useful, and recognized business, profession, occupation, trade, or employment until the termination of the war.This was passed during World War I (1918) and the then NY Governor said:  The purpose \u2026 is to force every able-bodied male person within the State to do his share toward remedying the conditions due to the present shortage of labor.This is confirmed at  I don't know if it was ever challenged on constitutional grounds.

{"question":"tl;drI had an amount of annual leave at the end of my contract and I want to determine the daily rate for payment in lieu of the untaken days of annual leave.My employer initially paid half the rate that I expected, then made another payment at a rate close to my yearly salary divided by 260 days (52 weeks and 5 days a week).I would like to request one of the two daily rates below and find the legal basis for it:salary divided by 230, to account 30 days of annual leave entitlement into accountsalary divided by 222, as above, and also bank holidays (8 per year in the UK).No details in employment particularsI checked the  and it requiresdetails on the rate for payment in lieu of leave:1 Statement of initial employment particulars....\u00a0(4) The statement shall also contain particulars, as at a specified date not  more than seven days before the statement (or the instalment containing them)  is given, of\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0(d) any terms and conditions relating to any of the following\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i) entitlement to holidays, including public holidays, and holiday pay (the  particulars given being sufficient to enable the employee's entitlement,  including any entitlement to accrued holiday pay on the termination of  employment, to be precisely calculated),My offer letter does not include these details and I have no other legal documents.Scenario for 'payment in lieu'Consider the following scenario. For simplicity, let's assume:my contract had 24 days of annual leave (2 per month)a month has 20 working daysI left my employer on the last day of SeptemberI had 18 days left of annual leave to takeI could either (i) have requested a payment in lieu for the annual leave; or (ii) let the contract extend to cover the 18 days of leave. I think that 'payment in lieu' means that my gross payment should be the same in both cases (net payment differs depending on the monthly tax-free allowance in the UK, but that's between me and the taxperson). In case (ii) I could have extended the contract by 20 days to cover the full month of October: for 18 of those days, I would have taken leave from my stock at the end of the contract; for the other 2 days, I would have taken leave accrued by being on payroll during the month of October.If October had a bank holiday, then I would still have had one day of annual leave at the end of October.Questionsam I right in my understanding of 'payment in lieu' in the above scenario?which of the daily rates at the top of the post should I request?is there a legal basis for such a request?","answer":"  am I right in my understanding of 'payment in lieu' in the above scenario?No. You are not being paid in lieu of anything; you are being paid your accrued entitlement. Payment in lieu refers to payment instead of some other obligation. In employment it usually refers to an employer paying an employee instead of requiring the employee to work out the notice period  which of the daily rates at the top of the post should I request?Neither. The correct rate is the one your employer used - your annual rate divided by the number of days you get paid for. Annual leave continues to accrue while you are on annual leave (or any other paid leave).  is there a legal basis for such a request?No."}

Mason: Please read the letter to the court.It incriminated her. I understand that this tactic is highly unusual, to say the least. Perhaps it is because a lawyer can't impeach his own witness or ask leading questions, whereas he can do so on 'cross.'On the other hand, if a lawyer couldn't get a key (hostile) witness on the stand, except in the 'worst' way, why wouldn't he do so?","answer":"<h3>Lawyers control hostile witnesses with leading questions.<\/h3>The reason Perry Mason's tactic worked in this example is because his only 'real' question (which actually wasn't a question at all as the below analysis explains) was to read the letter.

{"question":"Some background first:When I was in college for engineering, the student-run IT department in the general dorm absolutely insisted on seeing every device on the network, and all the traffic too, to the point of banning even \"dumb switches\" (which are still smart enough to figure out which port a specific device is connected to, and only send its traffic to that port) and issuing hubs instead (which blindly broadcast everything they receive to all of their ports, so that the IT guys could see what I sent to my networked printer).This was when Windows XP was current, which allowed unrestricted access to its Public folders by default.  (they are PUBLIC, after all, right?)Put that together, and we have a bunch of college kids with officially-mandated direct access to the other students' Public folders!  (there are several things in that bold part, that the combination of should raise flags)Also at that time, the Public folders were the default save location for a number of things.  So quite a few of them had what appeared to me to be extensive music collections, which leads to:The question:I decided to be honest, and NOT copy that music for myself, but if I had, who would have been guilty of what?My understanding of copyright law suggests that:The student that I copied from would be guilty of unauthorized distribution, and could be fined accordingly, despite knowing nothing of what was going on or even how it was possible, simply because it was in their Public folder and thus made freely available to others.  Nevermind that \"Public\" was simply their software's default save location, and they again knew nothing of the ramifications.  Thus, this poor student gets slammed, completely out-of-the-blue, for something they had no idea about.The developer\/owner of that music-management software may also get sued for making it easy for this to happen.  (Public by default)The dorm's IT department might get a not-so-nice call as well, from a high-powered lawyer, about making it easy for this to happen.  (requiring access)*I* could simply claim ignorance, that the officially-enforced arrangement implied permission, and that I had accepted the offer on good faith.  I would then get off with little more than an order to delete everything that I had taken.  (and whatever the IT guys decided to do with me for their troubles)  Unless of course I had distributed it myself, knowingly or not, in which case I'd be in the same boat as the student that I had stolen it from.Is that true?  Did I put the concepts together correctly?  Or am I all wet?","answer":"Student CopyingA person making an unauthorized copy of copyrighted music (or any work protected by copyright) was committing copyright infringement, and could have been sued for doing so. The defense that a shared notwork folder implied permission would have been unlikely to succeed, as people are supposed to know that permission from the author or publisher is required, and neither another student nor the institution's IT department could grant such permission.However, that defense might have led to a defendant being classed as an &quot;innocent infringer&quot; under US copyright law, which greatly reduces the possible damage awards. In any case, suits over infringement where no profits are being made usually do not result in large damage awards and so are often not worth bringing.Student Copied FromGenerally a case for &quot;unauthorized distribution&quot;  would only be won if the source person had profited, ort attempted to profit, or had intentionally facilitated copying, usually by advertising in ways calculated to encourage infringement.A student who saves a lawfully acquired copy to the normal default location and makes no effort to en courage others to make unlawful copies, nor profits in any way, would not have been liable.Software DeveloperIf the developer's business model had depended on unlawful copying, or had advertised the software in ways which encouraged such copying, then a case for contributory copyright infringement might have been winnable. That is what happened to some of the file-sharing services, such as Napster. But there is no general duty to secure such software. If the software had legitimate uses, and was being promoted  only for such legit uses, and was not actually and knowingly depending on unlawful uses, the developer is not likely to  have been held liable.College IT DepartmentSimilarly the IT dept was not under a duty to ensure security or prevent infringement, to the best of my knowledge. A suit would have had to show that they were intentionally facilitation copying, profiting by such copying, or explicitly prompting unlawful copying for the Dept or its members to be held liable.Now the department might have been held liable for privacy violations that its policies made more likely, particularly if they had prevent students from taking measure to protect private information. But that is an issue the question does not address."}

Obviously neither of these exceptions applies to a census worker.Someone (including a census worker) who enters your home without permission could be charged with various crimes (e.g., Breaking or Entering).

{"question":"I am pretty new to the idea of asking for consent for storage for a website because I'm American. I understand that if I want to store anything, I need to ask users for consent.However, I'm confused by exactly how to abide by the Cookie Law. How do I know if the user has agreed to storage if I can't check the storage? Is it more  that I am allowed to check local storage to to see if the user has agreed previously? ie I don't store anything until the user agrees, but I may check local storage to see if the user has agreed to anything.I might be digressing, but the way I interpret the law was that if I track anything that can give insight into who the user is, that's bad. But if it's used for a purely frontend application for the website (eg a personal blog that may have a search backend, but the storage items aren't used for that), I don't have to worry so much? Esp if it's storage for things like color modes or positioning of navbar (left, right, up, down)?I guess what I'm getting at is what's a reasonable flow to be compliant at the same time as leveraging cookies so the site doesn't reset to vanilla and consent banner doesn't pop up every time the user visits?","answer":"Yes, a site may check for a cookie indicating past consent before prompting for consent to read and store cookiesWhen people speak of the &quot;Cookie law&quot; they usually mean the First of all, being a directive and not a regulation, the ePD is not itself legally binding. Instead it instructs the legislatures of member states to implement it, which they generally have done. So the actual binding law is the law of a particular country, which could vary from the wording of the directive. However, in this case, my understanding is that the implementations do not vary significantly.  An updated and revised ePrivacy Regulation (ePR) has been proposed, which would replace the ePD and complement the GDPR. But there has been dispute over the proposed terms of the ePR, and it has not yet been passed.Article 5 section (3) of the ePD reads:<ol start='3'>Member States shall ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned is provided with clear and comprehensive information in accordance with Directive 95\/46\/EC, inter alia about the purposes of the processing, and is offered the right to refuse such processing by the data controller. This shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out or facilitating the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly necessary in order to provide an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user.Notice that this covers both writing (storing) and reading (gaining access to) cookies and other information stored on a user's device. Cookies ar one form of such locally stored information (LSI).Note that the GDPR, which replaces Directive 95\/46\/EC, is used to define &quot;consent&quot; in the ePD.In general, one must have consent to read or store, and consent must be sought only when the user has been given &quot;clear and comprehensive information ... about the purpose&quot; of the stored information. The relevant exception for this question is that information (including cookies) which is &quot;strictly necessary&quot; to provide a service specifically requested by the user.Here the user has requested access to the web site, and may have previously agreed to accept cookies. The site must prompt for consent if the user has not previously consented (and the site will store cookies not strictly needed), and should not if the user has. Therefore, it is strictly  necessary to check for and read if present a cookie indicating that such consent has previously been granted. If such a cookie is not found, no consent has been granted.Strictly required LSI should not have a dual purpose where one purpose is not strictly needed. For example, an &quot;I accept cookies&quot; cookie should not also be used for tracking. That should be done (if at all) with a separate cookie, and only after consent is received.Note that there should be an easily found and easily used method or link on the site (preferably on each page of the site) to review the purposes of stored or accessed LSI, and to withdraw previous consent. If consent is withdrawn, the cookie indicating that consent has been granted should be erased, as should any cookies or other LSI not strictly needed to provide the services requested by the user.Keep in mind that the legal distinction is not between cookies that contain &quot;technical&quot; information and those that do not. That is not relevant. Nor is the distinction between cookies that might be used to identify a person and those that do not. The legal distinction is between cookies (or other LSI) that are strictly needed to provide the services requested by the user, and all other LSI. Strictly needed LSI does not require consent, all other LSI does.For example, a random string, used to determine the number of unique visitors, but not linked to any identifying info about the user, does not help to identify an individual user. But it is not strictly needed, so it can only be stored with consent.Data that are associated with an identifiable natural person (human being, not a firm or organization), are governed by the GDPR (where it applies). There must be a lawful basis for processing such data, which includes reading them from LSI, and storing them. Consent is one of the six possible bases for such processing, but consent need not be obtained if another lawful basis applies. When consent is the basis, it must be easily withdrawn by the user. Note that this applies to all data (PI) that is associated with a person, not just data that can readily be used to identify the person (PII).Note that other workflows are also lawful. For one example, if a site is a strictly membership site, it could prompt for a login before reading or storing any LSI, and then read previous preferences stored on the server by that user to determine whether consent for cookies has been granted.ConclusionA cookie indicating that consent to access and store cookies hs previously been given by a particular user can lawfully be read before a user is prompted for consent, under the ePD and its implementing laws."}

{"question":"I had this experience about 4 years ago (which actually culminated a series of many similar experiences) where I was cycling my way back home (Missouri) from a bicycle trip to Cancun MX.   In Washington county of Oklahoma, just east of Bartlesville on US hwy 60, while observing  (and respecting) all applicable laws, hwy patrol officer stops me because I am 'obstructing the traffic'. He then asks for my ID.I respectfully asked 'did I break any law?'  Officer: 'in Oklahoma bicycles have the same rights as the cars and also same responsabilities. That means you need to have the same speed as the cars'  Thinking that he was just mocking the law, I refused to hand him the ID. He could not articulate any reasonable suspicion. He then took me to jail for obstructing an investigation (where the cops stole\/took some of my most treasued memories from my bag because they found some Tylenol and Ibuprofen in the same jar) and the next day I posted bail (about $300 in full, cash) I was notified that I had to come back to Oklahoma for a court appearance. Seing that things get more complicated I decided to just pay them to get them off my back, go home and never return to that state. They would not accept my payment as it had been decided I had to come back. I came back, full of hope that the judge would listen and dismiss the case as it was based on a lie. Instead, he said that if I wanted to plead not guilty, I'd have to come back for a new court date to argue my case.  At this point I found myself back at square one, so I decided I'd pay them and get it over with (with a 'no contest plea') as the trips back and forth to OK would have cost me more that the ticket.

My questions are:1 - Is making up a law on the spot an acceptable alternative to the requirement that the cops have to have a reasonable suspicion in order to detain a civilian?Remember, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere'2 - Was the cop right?

It is clearly not a 'controlled access highway'","answer":"The main issue here seems to be uncertainty as to when you can refuse to obey an order by the police. You need to know how to distinguish between an order and a suggestion or request. The words used can tell you directly that you have been given an order: verbs in the imperative are unambiguously orders. Statements like 'It would help us if you would let us look in the trunk' is a suggestion; 'I need you to step out of the car' is on the cusp between a suggestion and an order. The case of  (where the court referred to the statement 'I need to see your driver's license' as a request) clarifies that a request coupled with a legal obligation to do something is in fact an order.You also need to know whether the order is 'lawful', which is about the officer and not you. If it would violate the law for the officer to force you to comply, the order is not lawful. But, as the court pointed out in , 'Whether a particular police order is 'lawful' is frequently a complex question involving some of the most vexing and intractable issues in constitutional law'. It is unreasonable to expect an ordinary citizen to have the depth of knowledge of case law that would be required to know with absolute certainty that an order is unlawful (barring the hypothetical situation where an officer orders you to commit a crime).What this means, then, is that if you do not comply with a officer's order, you run a substantial risk of being arrested. On appeal you might prevail in your argument that the order was unlawful, if you are willing to spend the time and money to make a point. That seems not to be the case here, since you didn't pursue justice to the end, instead you pleaded no contest (so the judge could not find in your favor). Pleading no contest extinguishes all hope of getting your money back. It is not clear to me what that deeper philosophical point would be, but I suppose that it would be that officers should be vigorously instructed in some of the finer points of Title 47 as it applies to bicycles and the fact that the 'show ID' requirement applies to motor vehicles, not all vehicles. There are many subtleties in law that are not commonly understood by officers, and while it would be highly desirable for officers to have lawerly expertise in the law, that is an unrealistic expectation. For one thing, what you need is a political solution coming from the legislature (a law about legal training for police), and you can't get a court order demanding that."}

Apparently breaking through a fence with no sign does not constitute criminal trespass, unless one of the other sub-sections applies.

{"question":"US, Arizona, if the city is important I will post but would rather not at this time.My dad moved into a condo some months back. For some reason he thought the upstairs neighbor might be plugged into his hot water. This morning he woke up and heard the neighbor's shower running. So went and flipped the valve on the hot water heater and sure enough the water stopped upstairs. So it sounds that it is the fact the neighbor is plugged into the hot water.Is this enough to start a process where evidence can be collected for a lawsuit?Is this enough where the police can investigate, securing a warrant to enter if need be?I believe that utility theft is a crime, should police be involved now or later?Whom should he engage first, counsel or police? An just an aside question that I am sure will be answered in time, do police share their findings with a victim so the victim can present that evidence in a tort case? ","answer":"Sure, you can sue; but who are you going to sue? You have to prove someone knew about the fact that one condo resident was going to be paying for the other condo's hot water.Mixed up plumbing and electrical systems are fairly common in apartment and condo complexes, especially ones that have been converted. Chances are high it's a mistake and was not done on purpose.If you can find the original general contractor, he's going to say it wasn't him, talk to the plumbing contractor. Who will say I didn't do it, and my work is only guaranteed for five years, so talk to the plumbing inspector. He'll say he didn't see it, and besides, all those inspection records were thrown out ten years ago. The condo association may or may not have had oversight of the construction. Can you prove the neighbor knew about it and didn't tell the condo association? Can you prove the realtor who your dad bought through knew about it? Was there a home\/condo inspection done - paid for by your dad or the seller -  before the sale that might have spotted it? The police aren't going to care; technically, it is a crime, in a way, but it's not like someone tapped into someone's cable TV or electrical power meter last week. This is a problem from years ago, more than likely from the original construction; so who is really responsible? The police aren't going to run that down.And, what are the damages? A few months of part of a power bill? Is it really worth a lawsuit and a lawyer? Against who? I can't see a lawyer jumping into it.If you want to do something for whatever comes next, yes, collect evidence. Tell the neighbor he\/she's on your hot water. Take photos and get a licensed plumber to take a look at it and give you an estimate for separating the water systems. That will document that the two systems are not separate. (Either call your own plumber or ask the condo association for the name of someone).Then, start with the condo association. They may be responsible for the inspections before the sale.  At very least, the condo association may have to check off on the repairs. And, they may know more about it (oh, yes, we've heard about that in a few other condos...) You could bring it to everyone's attention at a meeting; it may be a common issue in the complex, and other residents may not know about it.If, in fact, the neighbor doesn't have their own water heater, they may be more on the hook for expensive repairs than your dad. They may have more of a case against the condo association than your dad."}
{"question":"When prosecutors look at a statute, how do they determine the requirements to prove intent?For example, look at this statute:Whoever knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than $5,000 in any 1-year period; (U.S. Code Sec. 1030, par. 4)How does one determine what is necessary to prove a defendant acted knowingly and with intent to defraud? For example, do they need to prove the defendant knew he didn't have authorization? What about intent to defraud  do they need to prove he knew it was against the law, too?(tl;dr) My specific question: How do prosecutors determine the elements necessary to satisfy the mens rea requirements attached to certain laws?","answer":"This is actually a very complicated question, about (1) the scope of 'knowingly', (2) what kind of 'intent' is required for conviction, (3) how does the jury understand and evaluate concepts of intent and (4) how does an attorney persuade the jury that the situation does or does not satisfy the particular intent requirement. One thing we can dispose of quickly is the possibility that the law says that the accused has to actually know that the act is against the law. It is a standard legal fiction (2,400 years old) that the accused knows the law, or should have known.As for the 4th element, persuasion, on the strong side we have statements of intent by the accused \u2013 'And I pulled out my rifle and blew his head off, and I laughed the whole time'. What the jury has to decide is whether the accused had in mind a conscious purpose of doing some act (that is, it wasn't just an accident like butt-dialing, or an instant stimulus-response reaction to some event). 'Intent' generally falls in the realm of acting 'purposely', which the Model Penal Code2.02 defines as:  A person acts purposely with respect to a material element of an  offense when:    (i) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result  thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that  nature or to cause such a result; and     (ii) if the element involves the attendant circumstances, he is aware  of the  existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that  they exist.which more or less means what you think 'with intent' means. That doesn't say what they intended to do, it just distinguishes intent from negligence and accident. The prosecutor would then present factual evidence that the accused had a bad intent, like showing that he actually made an attempt to access credit card account data (that such data had been accessed when he broke into the system), etc.We can sort of dispose of the other scope question about 'knowingly', namely, what things would he have to know? The chunk accessing a protected computer without authorization can be interpreted in a number of ways, having to do with which elements of the clause are known to the accused. You might know that you were accessing but not know that you were unauthorized; you might know that you were accessing and unauthorized, but not know that the computer is protected. The only reliable way to know which is which is to study the case law on a statute and see if there is a controlling decision that say e.g. that you have to know that you are accessing and are unauthorized, but you don't have to know that the computer is protected. I haven't determined (yet) is there is decisive case law on this, but I'm betting that the outcome would be that not knowing of the protected status of a computer carries no weight.As for what kind of intent, there is a distinction between 'specific intent' and 'general intent'. The distinction comes down to having some evil purpose like 'make him suffer' (general intent) versus a specific evil purpose like 'kill him'.Finally, the people who actually decide, the jury, will be given instructions that say what they have to look for. Here is the tip of the tip of the iceberg, from California's criminal jury instructions. The judge will say...  The People must prove not only that the defendant did the acts  charged, but also that (he\/she) acted with a particular (intent\/  [and\/or] mental state). The instruction for (the\/each) crime [and  allegation] explains the (intent\/ [and\/or] mental state) required.  A[n] (intent\/ [and\/or] mental state) may be proved by circumstantial  evidence.    Before you may rely on circumstantial evidence to conclude that a fact  necessary to find the defendant guilty has been proved, you must be  convinced that the People have proved each fact essential to that  conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt.    Also, before you may rely on circumstantial evidence to conclude that  the defendant had the required (intent\/ [and\/or] mental state), you  must be convinced that the only reasonable conclusion supported by the  circumstantial evidence is that the defendant had the required  (intent\/ [and\/or] mental state). If you can draw two or more  reasonable conclusions from the circumstantial evidence, and one of  those reasonable conclusions supports a finding that the defendant did  have the required (intent\/ [and\/or] mental state) and another  reasonable conclusion supports a finding that the defendant did not,  you must conclude that the required (intent\/ [and\/or] mental state)  was not proved by the circumstantial evidence. However, when  considering circumstantial evidence, you must accept only reasonable  conclusions and reject any that are unreasonable.and then there will be some specific elaboration of whether they have to find that the accused just generally intended to do bad, versus intended to specifically defraud."}
{"question":"Some Background:My wife utilized a personal training service from a fitness\/gym company in Michigan. She signed up for a year contract knowing that she would have to move approximately 9 month into the contract. That contract expired last month, and (to nobodies surprise), we got billed again this month. Digging though my records, I have a signed contract stating that the service is for 1 year, and then goes month-to-month. I have placed 2 phone calls giving the requisite 40 days notice that I wished to cancel, the first time I was informed that I must make an in-person visit to cancel (a 3 hour drive one way for me), the second time I was assured it would not be renewed as month-to-month. Fast forward to this month, I get a bill where I don't expect one.Question:I contested the last charge, which was outside the scope of the original year-long contract. I also had my bank re-issue my credit card so they cannot bill me further. What can this fitness company try to do to keep taking my money, and what can I do to either head them off, or prevent them from charging us for a service we don't use, and have no intention of using, and is also not under contract anymore?Location:Michigan, USAUPDATE: A phone call to corporate seems to have resolved the issue. I still ended up getting a new CC number, and contesting the last charge. Will update again if anything ugly happens.","answer":"  what can I do to either head them off, or prevent them from charging  us for a service we don't use, and have no intention of using, and is  also not under contract anymore?That kind of notifications always should be made in writing, and in a way that allows you to prove that the other party received it (e.g., by email or a printout letter with a copy signed by the other party as receipt).If you are aware that the gym has recorded your phone call, you should ask it (and that means in writing) to preserve that recording in the event that the matter ends up in court. The sole request might reveal to the gym that you are willing to bring court proceedings if the gym insists to act unlawfully. Even if the gym eliminates the records despite your request not to do so, that would weigh against them because it would constitute spoliation of evidence.It would be helpful if in your email or letter you reflect that you even went to the gym, in accordance with the directions the gym gave you.If the gym persists with charging you and\/or reports you to a collections agency, your first and easiest recourse is to file a grievance with the Michigan consumer protection agency (I don't know the exact name, as agencies' names may change over the years).For now, as a precaution, you might want to send your phone service provider a request for preservation of records of the call(s) through which you gave your 40-day notice. That is the typical term for asking the phone company to create a back up of your records, since by default phone companies keep records for about a year. Ask that the preservation include the standard information: source number, target number, date\/time of the call, and duration.Regardless of whether the gym records phone calls, the fact that visiting the gym now takes you a three-hour drive [each way] suggests that the purpose of your phone call was to give the 40-day notice. Hence the potential relevance of retrieving those header records from your phone service provider."}

This means that it has no effect on the Delaware Business Search database, because that data is not controlled by a federal agency, and therefore not subject to FOIA.There have been requests for bulk access to this data in the past, and as far as I know, they have all been rejected.

The buyers, discovering its salvage status, are now having issues getting it titled in their name, and want us to get involved.To pass inspection with the sheriff's office it needs to have an air bag light (undiagnosed) fixed, and the buyers want us to pay for it. The light was on, prior to purchase, but they didn't ask about it, or ask us to do anything about it then. We accepted $900 lower than our asking price of $2600, informally agreeing the buyers could expect to have to do some general repairs as the car is 20 years old. The air bag light was never mentioned in negotiations.All parties in Colorado, USA.Note: the Bill of Sale states as-is.Update: The buyers have now abandoned the car outside our house, but are not returning our calls.Update and Close: The buyers took us to small claims court, and we won, based partially on 'as is', and partially because the judge believed we had no way of knowing it was salvage. He seemed unclear on whether only one of those elements would have been enough, so I'm not sure how helpful this is as a precedent, though.","answer":"Colorado statute  imposes disclosure requirements on the sale of vehicles with salvage titles.  That you didn't know it was a salvage does not seem to be of concern to this particular statute.  This means that you are potentially entitled to redress against the people who sold you the car as well, provided the sale occurred in Colorado and they failed to disclose it to you (i.e., you didn't just forget about it in the intervening years).  Given the presence of a law specifically covering your circumstances, it may be worth consulting with a local attorney to see what your obligations are.  There may be mitigating circumstances, but they are not currently obvious to me if they're there.

{"question":"Just want to know whether the government has a special lawyer or something like that.","answer":"In US, what kind of lawyer represent the government in the court?It depends on the type of matter and the government's role therein. There is no such thing as &quot;lawyer specialized in governmental matters&quot;.Only very few specializations can be mostly ruled out. For instance, the States never get married, whence expertise in divorce law is needed only when legislators are addressing an initiative toward enactment or amendment of statutory law.In criminal court the prosecutor represents the government, and his role is to prove that the defendant's conduct meets all the elements that constitute a crime.The legal matters the Food and Drug Administration handles are very different from those the Securities Exchange Commission and the USCIS address. The approach of delegating to governmental agencies the regulation and enforcement of specific types of issues translates to a need for lawyers versed in the corresponding branches of law.Additionally, every government department is exposed to lawsuits pursuant to its employer capacity. Hence the need for expertise in labor law just like with any other employer.These are only some examples illustrating the point why there is no narrow &quot;kind of lawyer&quot; for representing the government in court."}

{"question":"If a group of friends goes out several miles into Everglades National Park and does some target shooting. Are they violating ? What about if they were on any 'Public' land that is NOT a national park? What about if they were on 'Private' land? ","answer":"The key portion of the statute states that it applies to the discharge of a firearm:  in any public place or on the right-of-way of any paved public road,  highway, or street, who knowingly discharges any firearm over the  right-of-way of any paved public road, highway, or street or over any  occupied premises, or who recklessly or negligently discharges a  firearm outdoors on any property used primarily as the site of a  dwelling as defined in s. 776.013 or zoned exclusively for residential  use commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided  in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. This section does not apply to a person  lawfully defending life or property or performing official duties  requiring the discharge of a firearm or to a person discharging a  firearm on public roads or properties expressly approved for hunting  by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or Florida Forest  Service.Assuming that the permitted hunting approval exception does not apply in all cases, it would not be directly applicable in a federal park (where federal courts probably have exclusive jurisdiction), although there is probably an assimilative crimes act that adopts state law as a federal criminal offense in cases not provided for by express federal statutes that would apply as if it were state land.So, you can't discharge a firearm 'in any public place', over a paved road, over an occupied building, on a residential lot, or in a residential lot (other subsections limit firing guns from our vehicle).It appears that 'in a public place' is a question of fact, but that would not be synonymous with, land owned by the government. Instead, it would be in places where members of the public gather such as courtyards, malls, plazas, parking lots and the like. Some places in Everglades National Park or public lands would be 'in a public place', but that wouldn't necessarily apply to all places on government owned land. A secluded meadow or bare place in the marsh might not be 'in a public place.'Private land would usually not be 'a public place' although a mall or amusement park or concert venue or other place open to the public but privately owned probably would be 'a public place.' A paved private road would probably be covered, as would any residentially zoned land and any land in the curtilage of a home or occupied building. But, otherwise, shooting on private land (not from a vehicle) would be permitted whether it was vacant land, farm land, industrial property, or commercial property without occupied structures or paved roads (e.g. warehouses or storage sheds)."}

The tribunal pointed out that the restrictions impermissibly amounted to a generalized suspension a radice of that fundamental right.

{"question":"Inspired by , left the show on bad terms after the sixth season. The following year, the series finale featured several montages of clips from old episodes, but Farrell's character was notably absent, despite her long involvement with the show.When asked about the reasons for this, pretty much everyone agrees that it was a matter of permission; they needed Farrell's permission to use the clips, and couldn't get it. In the words of Ronald D. Moore, one of the show's main writers:In order to use a clip of someone from a previous episode, you first have to obtain permission from the actor in question.I'm inclined to take Moore at his word, since he is involved in the industry and I am not, but I was surprised to read this; I would have thought the studio would retain full rights to use their old episodes in any way they see fit.So, I was hoping Law.SE could help clarify my understanding. What legal grounds (if any) are behind this requirement?Aside: since I have only a passing familiarity with the legal profession, plain English explanations of any citations is greatly appreciated","answer":"This is the result of a contractual term in the standard agreement for TV actors:  (see section 'CLIPS WITH ACTORS').Generally speaking, TV actors do not own copyright in the film in which they appear. The actor does not make the film and so the actor does not get copyright. However, the standard agreement for a TV actor contains a clause requiring the studio to get the actor's permission to re-use the film for another purpose (such as creating a nostalgic montage in a later season). If such permission is not obtained then the actor can sue the studio for breach of contract."}

{"question":"The field of education uses many mnemonics, such as CUPS, RACE, KWL, the CRAAP test, SQRRR, etc. Most of these were originally created by academics, and introduced in academic journals.Many years ago I attended a college and my professor invented her own mnemonic, similar to those above, outlining the steps to teach a particular type of information. She never published this publicly and instead made this only available in a packet distributed to her students. Though I can't find my copy of this packet anymore, I don't recall any TM or Copyright, but instead a printed warning not to share the information.Unlike the ubiquitous mnemonics which I mentioned above, her mnemonic appears in zero publications, and after 2010 or so, stopped even returning search results; only alumni of her classes heard of this term. I also can no longer find contact information for the professor (in her 80's by now). Addition, she invented many of the words falling within the mnemonics, so not only is the mnemonic very special, the words within are her own invention. Her words don't appear in a dictionary, and there are no synonyms for them in English.I'd like to use her exact terminology in a textbook. How can I confirm that I can legally use this terminology? Do I need to search state databases for copyright? Trademark databases?","answer":"A mnemonic like CRAAP is not protected by copyright.  &quot;Copyright does not protect names, titles, slogans, or short phrases&quot;, so you do not run afoul of copyright law using that or any other abbreviation. There is a registry of copyright-registered works, maintained by the copyright office, where authors may register their works, but legal protection exists regardless of registering.Some abbreviations are protected under trademark law, which you can search . There are 50 registrations that include &quot;AAA&quot; and three that are just &quot;AAA&quot;, also you'll find WTF and LOL. Trademark protection doesn't forbid all uses of an registered abbreviation. It turns out that &quot;CRAAP&quot; is not a registered trademark, but it could be the registered trademark of a manufacturer of crab traps, so you would not likewise call your crab trap company CRAAP, but it would be okay for plumbing supplies (trademark is relative to business uses, which are described in the registration).The only other imaginable scenario that would impede your plan is a non-disclosure agreement. For that to be relevant, there would have to be a valid contract between you and the teacher which specifically prohibits disclosure of the acronyms. The chances that there is a contract between you and the teacher is so low that it is hardly worth considering, but let's explore that for a moment. A contract is an agreement between parties where each party promises to do something that they are not already obligated to do, in exchange for getting something that they do not already have a right to. You had a contract with the college, not with the teacher. The college clearly would not prohibit &quot;using any information gained in the course of study here&quot;, and the courts would not enforce any such &quot;don't use&quot; wording in a contract as unconscionable (why else do you go to college?). Your contract with the college allows you to take classes and use the knowledge that you gain. The teacher's contract with the college requires her to teach some content, and probably allows her to set certain rules of class conduct. She might have been able to toss you out of class for disseminating her methods, but at this point she has no legal recourse. NDA enforcement is generally limited to protecting &quot;trade secrets&quot;, which are defined in terms of information with independent economic value deriving from the fact that the information is non-obvious&quot;. Also, an NDA will have a time limit associated with it except in the case of highly-sensitive personal information (social security numbers), so the courts will not enforce language saying &quot;you can never make use of this information, or these names&quot;."}
{"question":"I am talking here about informatical robots that will make some operations without any human interaction.You can find many stories about poker robots that play without anyone behind the computer on online cash poker site. Each time is explained that their account were closed because the site chart say it is forbidden, and that player who played against the robot got their money back. But I never heard about one of thoses robots creator being sued. Is this illegal to violate thoses charts? Or only the site's operator can close the account and it can't go to court?(I took the example of poker but video games are facing similar problem : thousands of accounts level uped with bots and then sell on E-Bay or other websites.)So is this illegal and one man can have to pay a bill, or is this forbidden only on the website? Is this the same reglementation for Europe and America?","answer":"I don't think the issue is that it is a violation of a law, but rather that it is a violation of the terms of service you agree to when you sign up for the site - which is a breach of contract.You can be sued for breach of contract, if the site can prove any damages based on your breach. So if you use a bot to make money on a site, in violation of the site's license agreement, then I believe the site could indeed sue you to get the money back.Also, the phrasing of your question ('creating a robot') raises a separate issue. It is not actually creating the bot that is illegal, but using it where not allowed can be a violation of contract. Suppose person A makes a poker bot, just as a programming exercise, and doesn't use it. But then suppose person B uses the robot created by person A on a site that forbids it. Although this could be a gray area, I do not believe the site would have any recourse against person A (even though they probably would against person B)."}
{"question":"There seem to be at least a few crimes for which a lower-ranked officer can relieve a higher-ranked officer of command, most notably treason. While the lower-ranked officer would surely be highly scrutinized for taking such an action, it does seem a legal means of removing an officer of higher rank for criminal acts.What are those circumstances\/crimes\/accusations under which an officer of the United States Armed Forces can relieve a higher-ranked officer, without the involvement of an officer of higher rank than the one being removed?","answer":"Only in the most unusual and extraordinary circumstances &quot;conceivable&quot;Respect for the chain of command is central to the armed services. As a result, lower ranked officers generally cannot relieve a higher ranked officers of command. Instead, they must work through the chain of command, taking their complaints to their superior's superior. To do otherwise is usually considered mutiny. As far as I know, the only service that has made formal provisions for this is the Navy. This makes sense, given that ships at sea may be out of contact for extended periods.The Navy regulations involving a subordinate can relieve a superior of command are found in 1088. , issued by the Secretary of the Navy. Here is what that sections says:In the most unusual and extraordinary circumstances, a commanding officer can be relieved only by the next in succession to command. The problem must be so obvious and clear that any reasonable, prudent and experienced officer could reach only a single conclusion: that leaving the officer in command would seriously and irretrievably prejudice the public interests.Unless it is a undoubtedly impractical, the subordinate cannot act without the approval of\u2026higher authority... The subordinate can act only after much careful consideration and after an exhaustive investigation of all the circumstances\u2026  The decision must be based upon\u2026substantial evidence, and supported by the official views of others in a position to form valid opinions\u2026Any subordinate who relieves a superior will bear the legitimate responsibility for\u2026such action, and must be prepared to justify\u2026 it."}

{"question":"On several occasions I've found myself e-signing documents* (one such instance was consenting to a background check for a rental agreement). The companies that offer these services use questions to identify you, which ostensibly only you should be able to answer. In my experience, I've gotten two types of questions:Questions about places I've lived, e.g. 'in which of these cities is 6th ave?', or 'in which of these cities have you lived?'Questions about people I've known, e.g. 'which of these people have you been acquainted with?'The first question is usually unproblematic. The second one however, is why I'm here.This question comes up almost every time I have to 'sign' such a document and I'm not sure how they come up with the names, but when I'm lucky, they've misspelled the name of a person I know. Other times though, I've seen them butcher names of people so badly that I can only assume, of the four people listed, this one is the one 'I should know'**.When it gets that extreme though, I catch myself thinking, 'technically I don't know any of the people in this list', and as such I'd be lying about knowing a person that (in the worst case) might actually exist. I'm caught in the dilemma of needing to get my document signed by 'reading behind their algorithm' to intuit what they actually mean to ask and not getting my document signed because I really don't know anyone in the list***.So can someone tell me, what would\/could the legal ramifications of this lie of convenience be?* I almost always have the option of signing some other way, e-signing is just more convenient in those situations.** I've done this often enough that I know that this is the deciding question, whether they'll be able to 'verify' my identity*** I've always chosen not to lie :)","answer":"At least some of these services construct at least some of their questions so that the correct answer is 'none of the above'. Therefor assuming that one of the names must be the incorrectly spelled name of someone you do know is risky in that you might be marked as incorrect and have significant hassle in getting the service to accept that you are in fact you. I have had this happen to me.Some services do not use the 'who do you know' type of questions, but sometimes the answer to 'in which town\/county did you own property' is 'none of the above'.I don't think that the service can or will attempt to impose any legal consequences for a 'lie' beyond declining to accept your identity. It would be almost impossible to prove that a response was a lie rather than an honest mistake, and such answers are not given under penalty of perjury in any case."}
{"question":"Someone moved my things out of my apartment for me while I was out of the country. They then kept my things at their place and since I've returned they have refused to return my things to me. Can I get the police involved?","answer":"One option is to bring a civil lawsuit to obtain a court order for the return of your property, something that usually proceeds on an expedited schedule (often one to three weeks from filing to an order). The traditional name of such a lawsuit is 'replevin' although the modern and minority terminology for this kind of lawsuit is civil action for 'claim and delivery.'You could ask the police to intervene, and they might do so, but are not required to do so without a court order. This can take the form of a criminal theft charge, or could take the form of what is called a 'civil assist' when the individual comes to the place where the property is held in the presence of law enforcement which assures a peaceful transfer.Sometimes a court in another matter such as a divorce, or domestic violence criminal case, will enter an order authorizing or directing that a civil assist take place.The appropriate remedy depends to some extent upon the reason given for not returning the property. One valid defense to not returning property is that a lease created a lien in the personal property left at the premises for unpaid rent, or a lien for moving and\/or storage charges. The availability of such liens varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and based upon the precise details of the situation. Another valid defense would be that the person in possession of the property was not satisfied that they knew who owned it."}
{"question":"There are reports on the internet this morning that a group of people were able to hack Parler and download around 70tb of data from the servers before AWS ceased hosting the platform. There are plenty of accusations being levelled at Parler's users in regards to using it to coordinate activity during the 6th January Capitol Riots.Can law enforcement agencies in the USA use this data without violating any laws themselves? Would it be admissible in a court of law should charges be brought? Would this complicate legal proceedings should law enforcement seek a court order to seize the same data from the source (it is presumably still being held by AWS).","answer":"Yes:So long as law enforcement did not compel the hackers to hack the data and the data was recovered by Law Enforcement through their investigation of the Hacker's breeching the server's security.   Evidence of a crime committed by a third party is admissiable if it came to light during an unrelated investigation.The party that did the hacking could still be liable for any crimes they committed in their retrieval of the data.  There are occasions where someone who is committing a crime stumble upon evidence of a more serious crime and informs the police of the problem either because they would never want to be party to a serious crime, but also because it can help them get reduced sentancing to give up the greater evil.As an example, in &quot;Home Alone,&quot; when Kevin tricks Harry with the film clip of the gangster murdering Snakes with his Tommy Gun, Harry is freaking out telling this to Marv, but Marv realizes what's going to happen if they get caught:  They've been robbing houses in the neighborhood and the police would likely pin the murder on them rather than assume two seperate crimes occured in the same block.

{"question":"When a politician breaks a campaign promise, aren't there measurable damages to voters and donors? When a politician says something to make money, and doesn't do it, how is that different from fraud?","answer":"Typically the liability comes in re-elections.  If the people think the politician lied about his agenda to get their votes, they can kick him out and vote for his opponant.  How quick this happens is dependant on how likely the constituents are to flip, how badly you did your job promised, and what the population wants the person taking the job to do during the term (usually refered to as a Mandate).   In the U.S. Federally, the House of Representatives are the most likely to be dynamic, and quite prone to change, as they all must be elected every two years.  Next most responsive is the President, which must be elected once every four years.   Least reactive is the Senate, which is elected every 6 years (though 1\/3rd of the seats are up for re-election every two years, with almost every state having both senators in seperate cycles such that they will not be up for vote at the same time.  2020 Georgia has one scheduled senator election and one emergency senator election which is why they have two in that cycle).It's also important to know which level of government they can actually make necessary legislation on.   Fixing the roads is not something your National Government deals with, so you should look at state government (National government does fund Interstate Repairs, but the state is responsible for the actual repair work along their strectch of interstate. And don't go crying to your city council about immigration concerns... that's not their job.)."}

The only way the lawyer's &quot;mistaken&quot; tweet would forfeit the privilege is a scenario where the client instructed or consented to the lawyer's publication.

{"question":"It seems that the laws around the safekeeping of certain US government and national security information are described by President Obama's Executive Order 13526. These make clear that the ultimate power to declassify documents rests with the executive.Topically,  President Trump appears to be referring to this fact to justify being in possession of \"documents with classification markings\"; that he had the authority to declassify such during his Presidency and hence the documents are hence no longer subject to the protections demanded of classified documents. This, to a layman, seems like a (nearly) bulletproof defence.The one exception I can see is if a future President (e.g. President Biden) unilaterally reclassify the document at a higher level, now that President Trump no longer possesses his powers of classification under the Presidential office.This leads to two related questions:If the classification level of a document has been reduced - so exposing this to a larger audience - can it later be reclassified to a higher level?Can the President or delegated power capriciously classify any document in the possession of a political rival, without him or her knowing, and cause the rival to be in breach of law?","answer":"Ignoring the question of whether Trump violated US law by being in possession of some document (without concrete details, this cannot be assessed), we can consider what the &quot;laws&quot; are regarding classification of documents and consequences of violating those laws.&quot;Classifying&quot; information takes place within the executive branch \u2013 Congress and the courts do not classify documents.  defines &quot;classified information&quot; as something &quot;specifically designated by a United States Government Agency for limited or restricted dissemination or distribution&quot;, and &quot;unauthorized person&quot;means any person who, or agency which, is not authorized to receiveinformation of the categories set forth in subsection (a) of thissection, by the President, or by the head of a department or agency ofthe United States Government which is expressly designated by thePresident to engage in communication intelligence activities for theUnited States makes it a crime to &quot;knowingly and willfully communicates, furnishes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person&quot; of any classified information. The logic of the classification system depends on someone being always authorized to see and evaluate information in order to deem is &quot;classified&quot; in some sense \u2013 POTUS is universally authorized.There is  that pertains to former presidents,one promulgated by Treasury, saying thatAccess to classified information may be granted only to individualswho have a need-to-know the information. This requirement may bewaived, however, for individuals who:...Served as President or VicePresident.Note that this addresses (and was device with the intent that) a former president could access classified information which was not in their possession (&quot;access&quot;), and does not bear on the question of whether a current POTUS can legally retain documents which he classified.There is a separate &quot;whoever&quot; law, , which says thatWhoever, for the purpose of obtaining information respecting thenational defense with intent or reason to believe that the informationis to be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantageof any foreign nation...does typical spy things like breaking into military facilities, but that isn't relevant to POTUS retaining classified documents.Anyhow, if other people, who are unauthorized to receive such documents, come to possess them, then there could be consequences. But criminal sanctions under793 involve (1) illegally entering military \/ intelligence facilities or (2) authorized persons transmitting such data lawfully in their possession to unauthorized persons. Up to 10 years in prison is the penalty, plus fines. is the currently-visible version of the warrant petition.

{"question":"Before some people get all worked up, the question is being asked in the context of modding.Video game piracy is the unauthorized copying and distributing of video game software, and is a form of copyright infringement.Okay, so at least in one (and probably the major and common one) case it the sharing is illegal due to copyright law rules. But how exactly are game files protected and what exactly is protected?This standard treats the whole game as a singular component but does not define what would be covered by such a protection and what would be excluded. WIPO had recognized the complexity inherent in copyrighting video games, saying: \"Although Article 2 of the Berne Convention provides a solid basis for eligibility for protection of video games by copyright, they are in fact complex works of authorship, potentially composed of multiple copyrighted works.\" WIPO has also stated in one of its reports that \"there is no clear classification of video games and their protection will vary depending on each particular game and the elements that are part of it. In this sense, video games can be treated as computer programs and, thus, are classified as works of authorship; in that case, the source code for a video game is classified as a literary work. If pictorial or graphic authorship predominates, a video game may be classified as a visual arts work. Similarly, if motion picture or audiovisual authorship predominates, a video game may be classified as a motion picture\/audiovisual work.\"I understand that things differ between countries, let us stay in International\/USA space.

When the game is packaged as a final product it contains a lot of stuff that is fairly easy to determine as protected and copyrighted work: audio assets (music, sound effects), graphical assets (textures, sprites, etc), other visual assets (3D models aka meshes, protected design-wise) and so on. This packaged game is our videogame medium. But along with this game, a bunch of meta-data is packaged as well. This metadata has no possible copyrightable value by definition (and can be actually considered as a \"fact\" or \"factual data\") and it does not even belong to the IP holder\/wonder but rather, in some way, to the creators of the tools itself (Unreal Engine, for example).

{"question":"For a couple residing in Massachusetts, the Man makes $100,000 \/yr before taxes. The wife in last 13 years had mostly stayed at home, or brought in a very small fraction of the family income from non-continuous employment. However, she is well educated (with some of the training was done during the time of marriage) and potentially can make some $40,000 \/yr. Moreover, over the years of marriage, the Man urged the Wife to seek a job and develop a career, but she was reluctant to do so.Their total saving amounts to $150,000 (both cash and Man's IRA). The couple has 2 minor kids.Now, the Wife wants to divorce (the Man does not).The MA law regarding Child-Support is formulated in a formula that's seemingly simple - but some caveats hide there. Even more so is the formula for Alimony.What is the Man expected to pay and for how long, assuming 50% custody over the kids?Specifically:Does the court consider the Wife's potential income?What does the 'Income used to calculate Child Support' entry in the Alimony formula means? Is it the whole Man's gross income (in this case, no Alimony is expected)?Is there a way not to equally divide the couple's assets, mainly based on the fact that all savings are from the Man's income?","answer":"  What is the Man expected to pay and for how long, assuming 50% custody  over the kids?I'm not going to answer this part of the question very specifically as it strays to close to the individualized legal advice that Law.SE does not provide. Also, in a domestic relations action there is not one reliable and predictable answer to this question. Even if the facts are identical, different judges have the authority to reach different results that would both be upheld on appeal as not constituting an abuse of discretion.AlimonyAs a , in a 13 year marriage, alimony is not awarded for more than 70% of the length of the marriage (about 9 years or less). The starting point for a 'general alimony' determination is , but that is only a starting point and can be modified for a variety of reasons. Judges have considerable discretion in varying an alimony award from this starting point. But, if the purpose of the alimony award is more specific, the amount may vary considerably based upon that justification.Child SupportAs a general rule in Massachusetts, child support lasts until (1) there are no children of child support age who are not emancipated, or (2) until the parents income and the children's custody arrangements are such that they balance out and leave no net child support obligation in either direction (with 50-50 parenting time, this would imply roughly equal incomes), although child support could be reinstated if that balance changes.How long a child is eligible for child support . It can end as soon as a child is age eighteen and no longer in high school (or earlier if a child is emancipated, for example, upon marriage) for that child, and can last as long as until a child is 23 years old if the child is 'principally dependent' upon a parent and enrolled in college as an undergraduate or disabled in some way.The child support calculation is rather intricate and the guideline amount which is used as a firm starting point in the determination is determined based upon resources found . Basically, the calculation is a function of: (1) each spouse's income, (2) the number of nights that each child spends with each parent, (3) any extraordinary expenses related to a particular child, and (4) payment of certain expenses (like health insurance) in lieu of cash child support payments.A rule of thumb in a case with 50-50 parenting time and two children is that child support will be about 1\/8th of the difference in income between the parties, but this is a quite crude estimate.  Does the court consider the Wife's potential income?A court will consider a wife's potential income if a husband can prove by a preponderance of the evidence with affirmative factual support that she can earn that potential income in light of the parenting arrangements in place and a possible need to obtain further education or training to become more employable in the long run.Getting a court to impute income equal to 30 hours a week at minimum wage isn't too challenging. Getting a court to impute a significantly higher income will usually take expert testimony or a long history of higher earnings. In the factual situation you present, the possibility that a well educated spouse 'could earn' $40,000 is unlikely to be accepted by a judge since there is no history of that kind of earnings. Imputed income is usually, in practice, based upon what a spouse can 'definitely earn' and not what a spouse 'could earn' in an average situation. Judges are very reluctant to impose child support or alimony obligations based upon 'phantom income' without quite convincing evidence that a failure to earn income is predominantly willful rather than due to an inability to do so.A court will also consider potential income if it appears that a spouse is deliberately underemployed for the purpose of manipulating child support and\/or alimony obligations. Whether this is the case is usually based upon historical precedents of earnings. If someone has never had significant income in the past, the court is unlikely to assign much potential income to a spouse. If a spouse used to make a lot of money and suddenly sees a drop in income around the time of the divorce for no easily explainable reason, the court is likely to find that the spouse could earn more and has decided not to in order to manipulate the process.When a court considers potential income this is called 'imputed income'.A court may also impute income, relative to what is official reported on tax returns, if there is proof by a preponderance of the evidence that a spouse is concealing a substantial amount of income (e.g. if there is evidence that a barber only reports half of the income that he or she actually receives, or that a self-employed person receives significant income 'in kind' in barter transactions).  What does the 'Income used to calculate Child Support' entry in the  Alimony formula means? Is it the whole Man's gross income (in this  case, no Alimony is expected)?There is a very detailed statutory definition of 'income used to calculate child support.' This definition of income is broader than the definition of taxable income in some respects (e.g. it would include annuities received as a matter of right from a trust that has already been taxed on that income and that is therefore not taxable income, or earned income that is tax free such as a pastor's housing allowance), and it is narrower than the definition of taxable income in other respects (e.g. some things that could be considered investment income for tax purposes is treated exclusively as an asset to be divided in a property division for child support and alimony purposes). Certain second jobs after someone is already working 40 hours a week are not considered as income for child support purposes.Some kinds of income that cannot be considered for child support purposes, such as a regular and consistent pattern of receiving economic support from family, might be considered by a judge for alimony purposes.  Is there a way not to equally divide the couple's assets, mainly based  on the fact that all savings are from the Man's income?A couple's assets are not always equally divided, but the fact that all savings are from the Man's income is not a reason for doing so. For domestic relations law purposes, all income earned by either spouse during the marriage is going to be considered to have been earned equally by both spouses in the absence of a prenuptial agreement. This is called the 'partnership theory of marriage.'Six of the most common reasons for a couple's assets to be divided unequally are:The assets are 'lumpy' and are as a result, not easily divided. For example, suppose that 90% of the couple's net worth is equity in a commercial fishing boat that the husband operates for his livelihood. In a case like that, the husband might be awarded the fishing boat, and the wife might be awarded more alimony and\/or a promissory note with the fishing boat as collateral that the wife would receive to balance out the award of the fishing boat to the husband.The court wants to more completely disentangle the couple financially and reduce non-payment risk associated with alimony.For example, suppose that the couple has easy to divide assets (e.g mostly a large amounts of cash in a savings account), and the husband would ordinarily be required to pay substantial alimony to the wife. The court might award all or most of the cash to the wife, rather than just splitting it 50-50 in exchange for reducing or eliminating the husband's alimony obligation.An unequal division of assets could also be made in which some of the property award is treated as 'prepaid child support' that is a credit against future child support obligations, although this is less common, and would ordinarily be done only when the spouse owing child support is self-employed or lives abroad or for some other reason would be expected to be particularly hard to collect child support from going forward.The court may be honoring the pre-marital status quo, or honoring the inequalities created by gift and inheritances from one spouse's family.Suppose that a wife comes to the marriage with a net worth of $10,000,000 and the husband comes to the marriage with a net worth of $100,000. Two years later they divorce. The court may try mostly to return the couple to the pre-marital status quo, rather than trying to give each an equal share of the couple's assets.The court may be implementing the terms of a valid prenuptial agreement.This is pretty self-explanatory.The court may be punishing 'economic waste' by a spouse.For example, suppose that husband and wife were joint owners of a residence and a vacation home of equal value. When they separate, husband burns down the vacation house out of spite because he knows that his wife is attached to it (insurance does not pay for the loss because it arises from an intentional act of an owner of the property, but arson charges are dismissed after the first trial ends in a hung jury). The court might award the husband the vacation house and the wife the residence, equalizing the property division based upon the pre-arson value of the houses, rather than equalizing the time of divorce value of the house, to punish the husband for making the total amount of property available to distribute smaller through conduct more culpable than mere negligence or incompetence.The court may make an unequal property division based upon economic need.For example, suppose that husband needs a drug that costs $5,000 a month to stay alive and functional, while wife does not, and both husband and wife are retired and have no earned income. The court might award a disproportionate share of the marital property to the husband to reflect his greater economic need for funds."}

{"question":"My high school life was subpar at the very least. I was constantly bullied and never received the necessary protection from school staff. This coupled with dwindling grades created a negative feedback loop. My health was degrading both mentally and physically so I consulted the school counselor. She was unwilling to provide any help let alone documents needed for a transfer. My custodial parent wasn't any more supportive either, so I gave up on the idea and kept going to school, barely meeting the requirements for graduation.It's been almost two decades since I graduated and left NYC, but bad memories still haunt me to this day. From time to time I wonder whether I might have been able to switch schools without the school's nor my custodial parent's consent, had I known better.Can students struggling like me submit transfer applications on their own to move to another school unsponsored? Does the availability of such choices vary by state?","answer":"The primary question is whether the target school can\/must accept you. A private school is not compelled to accept you, a public school might be. Because of the law compelling you (as a minor) to go to school, some public school will have to accept you as a student. However, as a minor, your preference is low on the list of legal priorities. The primary controlling factor is the school district where you live, and their policy. They may demand that you attend the school &quot;in the area where you live&quot;, or it can be an urging of various strengths. It is conceivable that you can attend school in an entirely different district (we have some cross-district migration possibilities, but that is rare).If district policy allows for a student to go to a school outside their home zone, then the question of discretion comes up: it is highly unlikely that a district would allow a problem student to &quot;impose&quot; himself on a foreign school, so the school intended to receive the student probably has some say in the matter. Parental consent will be essential, so if the parent(s) oppose moving the student, the district is unlikely to allow the transfer. The student might also be consulted. In other words, no, student desire alone will not enable the student to transfer schools. The school that you are assigned to by default has even less direct say in the matter, but indirectly it could influence the recipient school's willingness to allow the transfer.For NYC,  is a preliminary page regarding transfers. Safety and accessibility concerns are easy, also moving within the city etc. but academic and social concerns are &quot;a possibility&quot;, one to be determined on a case by case basis."}

Eagle, Globe, and Anchor (EGA)","answer":"No, it is not illegal to use the symbol of the federal government for your own personal use as it is a public domain symbol.However, the USMC will frown upon it.  Marines have a sort of warrior culture ethos to them, when compared to the other branches of the U.S. military and a strong culture among those who served.  Among Marine culture 'there is no such thing as a former Marine'... that is, once you enter the service, you are a marine even if you retire (a former Marine is usually someone who was dishonorably discharged OR committed an action that would have gotten him\/her discharged had they not retired).  They do not take kindly to Stolen Valor (pretending or seeming to pretend you served when you did not).  While this is legal to do per SCOTUS rule, it's not considered advisable.  Most of the US military have dim views of Stolen Valor and will react very negatively.  And seeing as how the Marines like to boast in song that they Guard Heaven for God upon Death, these are not enemies you would like to make.  Tread extremely cautiously while doing this."}
{"question":"When U.S. corporations want to merge or are subject to acquisitions (for example Oracle acquiring Sun Microsystems in 2009) it seems they must seek approval from the European Commission --- which is another jurisdiction.Questions:Why must U.S. companies get European Commission approval?What could happen if the U.S. firms chose to ignore the European Commission's decision?Are there other juridical bodies in other jurisdictions that can stop U.S. mergers?","answer":"Countries, and supranational governments like the EU, have jurisdiction over companies that do business in their jurisdictions.Oracle is technically not a U.S. corporation; it's a closely related group of California and Delaware corporations. Very few companies incorporate under U.S. federal law (I believe some banking corporations are required to, but don't quote me on that). Almost all companies are incorporated under state law.However, if Oracle does business in Texas, it still has to obey Texas law. And if it does business in the EU, it still has to obey EU law.Some laws make distinctions in some corporate matters between domestic corporations (incorporated under that state's laws) and foreign corporations (incorporated under another state's laws). But if you do business in a state, including an EU member state, you still need to obey that state's general laws, including antitrust law.Short version: if you visit another country, you can't go around shooting people, then say, 'your laws don't apply to me, I'm an American.' Neither can a company, no matter where it's incorporated.As for stopping the merger...any country where the merging companies do business can stop the merged company from doing business there if the merger violates local law. If this is a major, commercially important region like the EU, then failure to get EU approval will stop the merger. If it's a minor territory, the company will sometimes enter into an agreement to divest itself of local assets or entities. For example, if merging Oracle and Sun would create an antitrust problem in the minicomputer repair market in Laos, the merged entities would sell off either Oracle's or Sun's Laotian minicomputer repair division."}
{"question":"Yesterday, 3\/27\/18, it was reported that the porn actress Stormy Daniels sued President Trump's lawyer Mr. Cohen for defamation because he alleged that Stormy Daniels did not have an affair with Mr. Trump.If not, then how can they argue a defamation?  Even if the allegation of the affair never having taken place is false, it is a lie which does not damage anyone's reputation (ie, it does not 'defame' anyone).  In fact, even if it is a lie, it seems like it is a lie which can only serve to improve someone's reputation.Is there any precedent or law which recognizes a claim of not having an affair to be defamatory? Is there any law or precedent to make a claim that someone lied publically (but not under-oath) a defamatory claim?Edit:  shows that the claim of defamation stems from allegation that Stormy Daniels was called a liar rather than from the allegation that she did not have an affair.  In a similar vein, hypothetically, if Mr. Cohen made a public statement that Stormy Daniels was lying about being or having been an adult movie actress, would that be defamatory?","answer":"Saying 'they didn't have an affair', in isolation, would not be defamation.  But we have to look at the context.  Daniels had previously stated publicly that they did have an affair.  So when Cohen said that it wasn't true, he was (claims Daniels) effectively calling her a liar.  Calling someone a liar is potentially defamatory.You can read Daniels's complaint .  See paragraph 67:  Both on its face, and because of the facts and circumstances known to persons who read or heard the statement, it was reasonably understood Mr. Cohen meant to convey that Ms. Clifford is a liar, someone who should not be trusted, and that her claims about her relationship with Mr. Trump is 'something [that] isn't true.'  Mr. Cohen's statement exposed Mr. [sic] Clifford to hatred, contempt, ridicule, and shame, and discouraged others from associating or dealing with her.As to whether calling someone a liar is defamatory, there's a long article on the subject .  There are at least some cases where courts have held that it is.Gutterman, Roy S.  'Liar! Liar? The Defamatory Impact of 'Liar' in the Modern World.'

{"question":"Are corporations subject to international law? A corporation seems to be subject to international law just as much as an individual is, at least according to a decision made by the U.S. against Talisman Energy.In 2001 the Presbyterian Church of Sudan filed a lawsuit against theCanadian oil and gas producer, Talisman Energy, under the US AlienTort Claims Act, which provides US courts with original jurisdictionover certain tort claims filed by aliens. In the suit, it was claimedthat Talisman aided the Government of Sudan in the commission ofgenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. According to theclaim, Talisman worked alongside the Sudanese Government in thecreation of buffer zones around certain oil fields, which effectivelyassisted human rights violations and the perpetration of internationalcrimes in order to gain access to oil by displacing the populationliving in the areas around the oil fields and attacking theirvillages.The District Court of New York dismissed the claim on 12 September2006. On 3 October 2009, the decision was affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  The Court of Appeals held that, dueto previous case law, it had to look at international law to decidewhat standard was applicable to establishing aiding and abettingliability for human rights violations. Turning to international law,the Court held that purposefully intending the violations, rather thanknowledge of the violations alone, was the applicable standard. So, inorder to determine liability under the Alien Tort Claims Act theplaintiffs must show that Talisman acted with the purpose toadvance the Government's human rights abuses. The Court held that theclaimants had failed to establish that Talisman acted with thepurpose to support the Government's offences.However, I am wondering if it applies to all companies and under any situation. I couldn't really find anything about this.","answer":"I would not say this was a case of Talisman Energy being &quot;subject to international law&quot;. Rather, Talisman was subject to US law, because the Alien Tort Claims Act grants US courts jurisdiction over certain claims originally arising outside the US. Many countries apply their laws outside their borders in certain circumstances. They cannot always enforce this, but in some cases they can.Here the US courts held that non-US law must be consulted as to the standard of liability to be applied. The district court did so, and found that by that standard, Talisman was not liable, and so dismissed the claim. I would call that a decision for Talisman, not against it.Companies  (and individuals) engaging in international activities must always be aware that the laws of many countries  may apply to their actions. This is a general truth, although the details vary widely with different circumstances."}

This is by no means guaranteed, since it does not say that explicitly, and it is up to the Senate to determine whether, for example, lying during a confirmation hearing about previous conduct would satisfy the requirements of Article 2, Section 4.

{"question":"Lets say that an individual, Bob, has a regular job which covers his daily expenses, but also has an illegal side job.  A decent percentage of his disposable income is due to Bob's illegal activities, but he has some disposable income coming from his legal activities.  Both sources of income are placed into a bank, and bob then makes payments using a credit\/debit card.I'm wondering where the line is drawn for stating that someone has received illegal goods, as there is no longer a way to tell what money was legally earned and what was illegally earned.  I'm wondering both in cases in which one is aware of bobs illegal activities and in cases where the receiver of the money does not know it's illegal, but could still be compelled to refund it if it were illegally obtained.A few examples of the ambiguous situations I can think of:I assume if Bob buys a single drink at a local bar this would not be ruled as spending illegal money and the bar would not be committing an offense even if the owner of the bar was aware that Bob had an illegal income source, as Bob could easily purchase a drink with his legal income.Likewise I assume if bob goes out to buy a Yacht that he could never afford with his legal income it would be considered to be purchased with illegal profits.However, what about a more ambiguous case.  If bob buys an expensive fur coat for someone, which he could afford to do with his legal income, but which he likely wouldn't have chosen to spend money on if he didn't have the additional illegal income, does the coat count as profiting from illegal goods?  What if Bob offers a smaller sum of money to many people, small enough that Bob could easily afford to give such a gift to one person, but the combined cost of so many small gifts adds up to an amount bob couldn't\/wouldn't have been able to afford without his supplementary income?  Could someone argue that the gift they received from Bob came from his legal income, but the other gifts Bob made to others was due to Bob's illegal activities, by claiming Bob was likely to give a gift to them without the extra illegal income but not to the others etc?","answer":"Money is a negotiable instrument - that means that it comes into your possession lawfully (i.e. you are not complicit in any illegality) then it is yours even if the person you received it from obtained it unlawfully."}

(This is for US law btw)Suppose I launched a company called Pyramid Scheme, inc. And we were 100% direct and transparent that this was a Pyramid scheme. We literally explained word for word that it is a Pyramid scheme:You can put money in and we pay you out based on the next people that put money in after you. If you are stuck on the bottom rung you will likely not see a return, THIS IS A Pyramid SCHEME.I know (I'm pretty sure) Pyramid schemes are illegal, but if you completely disclose it and are 100% open about it, is it still illegal?

But there are potentially also state laws to worry about.  Under  17.461:&quot;Pyramid promotional scheme&quot; means a plan or operation by which a person gives consideration for the opportunity to receive compensation that is derived primarily from a person's introduction of other persons to participate in the plan or operation rather than from the sale of a product by a person introduced into the plan or operation.A person commits an offense if the person contrives, prepares, establishes, operates, advertises, sells, or promotes a pyramid promotional scheme.

You might not get caught, but if you do the penalties may include a fine or a custodial sentence.For example, you might find yourself doing this in, say, New York - you would probably not run into legal issues there, provided you had no information to suggest your access was unauthorised.Different laws and principles apply to trespass to land, which exists to vindicate your right to exclusive use and enjoyment of your property - you can't enter someone else's land except where consent is implied. For example, if you have an unlocked front gate and a path that leads up to the front of the house, you'd be able to walk up to it for the purpose of going to the front door to visit.

{"question":"Recently I inquired to my landlord about getting some Guinea Pigs. He wanted to charge me $25\/month for the guinea pigs; when further pressed about why I needed to pay a charge (Guinea Pigs generally stay in their cage and wouldn't cause much damage) I was told they were legally required to charge for any pets, because they charge for dogs and that if they didn't it would be considered discrimination. This makes absolutely no sense to me. I don't see how it would possibly be considered discrimination. I do understand that regardless he can charge whatever he wants for pets. I'm just wondering if this is really a valid reason.As for what the lease says about pets, under tenant obligations:Not to keep in or about any pets unless specifically authorized as aspecial condition into this Rental Agreement.So I would need to sign an updated lease in order for this to happen, which makes sense.I did do a bit of googling and could not find anything related to pets or discrimination beyond :In Wisconsin, Wis.

It is illegal for an owner or property manager to refuseto rent to a tenant, evict the tenant, require extra compensation orharass a tenant because he or she keeps an animal that is speciallytrained to lead or assist a tenant with impaired vision, hearing ormobility...This does not apply to me.","answer":"I do not believe that there is any such law, although it is conceivable that the landlord is confused about what laws, generally called &quot;non-discrimination laws&quot; actually require.It may be wise policy for the landlord to treat everyone who owns a pet in the complex to pay pet rent, and it may be not worth the expense to the landlord to pay an attorney to revise his lease for your benefit to afford you the privilege of paying him less rent that he would have charged you otherwise.

{"question":"Suppose a person seeks asylum in a new country, like the US or in Europe. But after they get there they find that the people who were threatening them in their home country, for example as part of a gang, have members working in their asylum country. If they find out where this person is and start threatening them there too, I assume they would work with domestic law enforcement. But what if that law enforcement is known to be unfriendly to immigrants (perhaps for frequency of these kinds of situations) or if they are just as helpless in managing these people as the country they left? At that point is the precedent that they just make do, saying \"at least this country doesn't let civilians own guns\" (that can be moved across the border)? Or is there international law guiding the handling of asylum seekers and refugees that dictates they be transferred to a 3rd country?","answer":"A person threatened by a gang is not presumably a refugeeA refugee is someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.A person who is fleeing a gang may genuinely be in danger, but they are not a refugee unless the threat is from one of the reasons above. Owing $50k to your crack dealer that you can't pay back does not grant refugee status. Your asylum application will be denied and you will be returned to your home country. Or, if you refuse to go, be held indefinitely in immigration detention: there are many people around the world who have spent decades like this.However, that just begs the question.There is no law that requires a country to pass on asylum seekers to a 3rd country. Indeed the UN convention requires that the country where asylum is sought processes the applicant. This doesn't always happen and there are countries that tacitly or actively encourage refugees to move along.Of course, a very unfortunate person could be a refugee from country A be granted asylum in country B and then become a refugee from that country and seek asylum in country C."}

Many disciplinary committees are composed of attorneys themselves, and sometimes the committees can shy away from disciplining their own.In Texas, members of the public can file a complaint with the .In my own experience, simply threatening to file an ethics complaint against a city attorney for a very clear and ongoing ethical violation very quickly fixed the ethical problem."}
{"question":"Question pertains to United States: California. I am including as much information as may be pertinent.My mother died a few weeks ago. I was estranged from her as my parents divorced when I was a child and grew up with my father.Because of the estrangement I knew nothing of her finances, and only by going through paperwork to clean out her apartment did I learn any financial information. Because she rented an apartment there is no house to be considered. Her vehicle was stolen a few months before her death so no assets there.

{"question":"If you break a law today and get away with it for 5 years. If the law that you broke would be repealed 5 years later could you still be prosecuted for breaking the law while it was in effect or does repealing a law include removing all possible prosecutions of possible law-breaking even if the breaking of the law happened while it was still in effect?","answer":"In general, yes. states that:The repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide, and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liability.Translated into plain English, this means that if you were to smoke marijuana in a Yellowstone National Park campground today, and Congress were to pass an act saying &quot; is repealed&quot; tomorrow, you could still be arrested and convicted for possession of a controlled substance next week.  However, if the act instead stated &quot;28 USC 841 is repealed and no retroactive prosecutions shall take place&quot;, then you can't be convicted.(The other half of 1 USC 109 is basically the same thing, applied to temporary laws: if a temporary law expires, you can still be prosecuted for actions taken while the law was in effect, unless the law states otherwise.)"}

{"question":"Wallhax is a website selling cheats for online games like Among Us, Apex Legends and dozens of others. Clearly what they do is in clear violation of these games' terms of services. however, they have some (superfluous if not poorly written) clauses meant to prohibit the affected game developers from buying and inspecting the cheats:You agree you are not an employee of [...] and are not a family member or acquaintance of the aforementioned.You agree you are not an employee of any law firm contracted with [...] and are not a family member or acquaintance of said firm.You agree you are not an employee of any company offering an anti-cheat service including [...] and are not a family member or acquaintance of the aforementioned.You are not an employee of any game development studio.You are not purchasing from our site for any investigative purposes.You agree not to impersonate another person.You may not access the The Service, the website, forums, or software of The Service if any of the above terms apply to you.If you violate any of the above terms you agree to pay Wallhax $30,000 USD for each login to our software and forums.Now, imagine if a game development studio whose game's terms of services are violated thanks to Wallhax's products' assistance decides to ignore Wallhax's ToS, buys (either via a developer themselves or via a random person) the cheats, inspects how they work and updates the game to be resilient against them.Also imagine that Wallhax discovers it and demands the studio to pay thirty thousand dollars for each time the developer logged in. The studio stonewalls Wallhax, stating that the services they provide violate the game's terms of services, and Wallhax takes them to court.Would Wallhax manage to make the game developers pay the damages specified in the ToS?Disclaimer: I do not belong in the group of people prohibited from accessing WallHax's products. Nor have I bought or do I intend to buy them. This question is of theoretical interest.","answer":"NoApart from the final clause, none of the others is remarkable: a business can choose who it does and does not do business with subject to anti-discrimination laws. Of course, a law enforcement officer acting in the course of their duties would not be bound by any contract.However, the final clause is a penalty clause.A penalty is a clause that sets a harsh monetary punishment for the breach of a contract term, or failure to uphold contractual obligations.However, if the amount of money requested is greater than, or disproportionate to, the damage or loss that you actually suffer, there is the risk that this clause would be considered a penalty.According to the court, a clause is a penalty if it requests the payment of an amount that is extravagant and unconscionable in light of the most significant loss that the breach could have caused.$30,000 for me logging into the system would, on the face of it, appear to be a penalty.It is a tort (a civil wrong) to knowingly interfere in a contractual relationship between 2 parties.Although the specific elements required to prove a claim of tortious interference vary from one jurisdiction to another, they typically include the following:The existence of a contractual relationship or beneficial business relationship between two parties.Knowledge of that relationship by a third party.Intent of the third party to induce a party to the relationship to breach the relationship.Lack of any privilege on the part of the third party to induce such a breach.The contractual relationship is breached.Damage to the party against whom the breach occurs.The conduct of Wallhax clearly satisfies 1-5 with respect to an existing contract between a game developer and its users. With respect to damage, if they can demonstrate that the use of cheats cost them something - even $1, then there has been damage and the game developer can sue Wallhax.Notwithstanding, because the purpose of the cheats is to induce users to breach their licence with the developer, Wallhax's contract has illegality of purpose at its core and is therefore void ab initio - a nullity from the beginning. That is, there is no contract.Even if Wallhax's conduct does not amount to tortious interference, the encouragement of people to disregard their contractual obligations - that is, to disregard their legal obligations - is clearly against public policy.Contracts against public policy are also void ab initio."}

The treatment costs $3.5 million for a single treatment, and even at this cost plausibly saves the health system about $5 million per patient.This is a very young feild, and their is a great need for more research.  This point is made most obviously by the fact that only 15% of people with haemophilia have haemophilia B. Most have haemophilia A, which is caused by a deficiency in a different gene for which there is currently no such treatment.Suppose one set up an organisation in England, say down the road from the group that developed the viral vector in University College London, to do research in this field.  You selected the questions you would attempt to answer such that they required experiments that involved the application of this treatment.  You then provided this treatment to patients who need it without licencing the technology.  One funded the organisation either through charitable donations or payments from the participants at a level closer to the cost of administering the treatment than the $3.5 million price tag.Would that constitute an infringement of any patents on the technology used?

{"question":"Is there a law or a judgment from a Court in the United States wherein it is established that a government (at any level) in the US, during an officially declared public health crisis, can enforce administration of a drug\/medical treatment onto a US citizen who has been declared by a public health authority (PHA) to be medically ill\/sick? I've come to know that a State government can make vaccination mandatory1. That said, I've also learned that in cases concerning mandatory vaccination4 of persons of certain age groups, some state governments provide exemptions on certain grounds, such as medical, religious and philosophical2.However, in my proposed example case, the drug in question, let us call it DRUG, is not a vaccine at all. Instead, DRUG is a drug which has induced swift recovery in some of the sick patients. Assume that information is not available in public domain as to whether the aforesaid recovered patients were able to give informed consent with regard to the treatment they received or not. Neither can a Jack or Joe contact those patients for the lack of their contact details available on account of protecting their privacy.Points to be noted:The available data from hospitals and PHA suggests that no known medical treatment or DRUG is so far universally effective on patients -- varied age-groups (some having co-morbidity too). Varying amount of information on other treatments\/drugs already tested on patients or been researched\/explored is available in the public domain, therefore, a citizen can attempt to make an opinion based on the available data.There may be a dearth of data released from PHA (whether deliberately done or not is not proven yet) on the number of patients administered with the DRUG who either fell more sick or died, but PHA is providing the statistics on those who did recover. Some probable reasons behind the data release could be: PHA might be biased in the favor of DRUG (for whatsoever reason - genuine or otherwise).Another reason could be: PHA's accountability is sought by political leaders, and the latter - under public pressure - might be pushing PHA to push forward with the DRUG. Like many political issues, this is subjective and open to speculation.Suggestion: consider historical data and analyses of earlier epidemics with similar medical treatment related issues, so as to make a reasonable assumption on why PHA is doing what it is doing.Note: to be clear here, I'm not trying to establish that PHA is a bad actor. But during crises, a lot of folks, whether acting as or for the authorities, want the crises to end as quickly as possible, sometimes by sidelining or deliberately encroaching the fundamental rights of the citizens. Hence, skepticism towards PHA's actions is justified from a citizen's point of view.There is emerging evidence, in the form of patient\/medical staff testimonies and\/or medical literature, that DRUG cause some serious side effects. Whether this happens with every patient or not is not clear yet.Armed with the information (as given in points 1,2,and 3), some veteran medical professionals using medical literature and statistical data available from PHA and hospitals have called into question the efficacy of DRUG.Despite the evidences (from points 3 and 4) already at the disposal of PHA, it has argued to their respective government that further delay in administering the DRUG upon the sick patients can severely harm the community's health and prosperity, and that the whole of the community should not be held as a hostage by those who are resisting the administration of DRUG, irrespective of them being patients.Information tsunami from hundreds of print media and electronic media outlets, and from dozens of social media sites has made it near impossible for a lot of citizens to accept as well as discard information, especially when 'sponsored content as news' has become the  norm for many such outlets and sites. The citizens concerned are capable of informed decision making. I'm not concerned with the process and information a citizen would use to reach a decision.Intertwined questions I'm looking to be answered:What hard legal facts (such as a law or the effects of its application discussed in a judgment) are available to a US citizen so as to make a reasonable assumption on whether their own elected government can forcefully (against their will) administer a drug\/medical treatment onto them if they are declared sick and are deemed a threat to public health? If step1 is positive, it would mean informed consent to medical treatment3 is no longer sought. However, does the law\/judgment allows information about the treatment be made available to the patient, whether voluntarily or mandatory? Please note: I'm only interested in a law (Act, Rules, Regulations, etc.) or a judgment from a Court of the US. Everything else, no matter how obvious it is, is a personal opinion which I'm not looking for. the question is not specifically about the ongoing health crisis in the US as of May 2020.Sources: ","answer":"The government cannot force people to get vaccinated, without passing a law to that effect. When they do, they can. This was sorted out in , 197 U.S. 11, when the Supreme Court, in 1905, ruled:  The liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States does not  import an absolute right in each person to be at all times, and in all  circumstances, wholly freed from restraint, nor is it an element in  such liberty that one person, or a minority of persons residing in any  community and enjoying the benefits of its local government, should  have power to dominate the majority when supported in their action by  the authority of the State.    It is within the police power of a State to enact a compulsory  vaccination law, and it is for the legislature, and not for the  courts, to determine in the first instance whether vaccination is or  is not the best mode for the prevention of smallpox and the protection  of the public health.Nothing in that ruling is specific to vaccinations as opposed to other medical treatments. If a law mandating a certain vaccination exists in a state, the citizen's beliefs about the efficacy of the vaccination are irrelevant to the legal issue -- get the vaccination, or the punishment.If a state were to pass a law mandating snake-oil innoculations to prevent smallpox infections, the law could be challenged in court. In general, people have the right to go about their business without the government interfering in their fundamental rights, but fundamental rights are not absolute, they are attenuated in case of a 'compelling government interest': which leads to a particular kind of judicial review, . While preventing a virulent deadly disease is arguably a compelling government interest, snake-oil is not necessary to reach that end (it does not reach that end, so it is certainly not necessary to reach that end)."}

{"question":"Can a layman with a power of attorney lawfully represent someone else in criminal matters?","answer":"Not in jurisdictions I am familiar with.  A 'Power of attorney' is a power to act as an attorney-in-fact, not to act as an attorney-at-law.  A layperson practicing law for someone other than herself is usually the unauthorized practice of law and is illegal in most jurisdictions.It would be permissible if a jurisdiction carved out an exception for a particular kind of case, but they generally don't and are very unlikely to do so in a criminal case.  For example, in Washington State 'Limited Practice Officers' can assist people with one of a very limited set of civil legal forms that do not need modification.There may be some exceptions, but they would be more likely to occur before a matter becomes criminal.  For example, the accountant who represents a taxpayer before the IRS, or the agent who files a form containing perjury to a federal agency like the post office or homeland security on your behalf.So it is very unlikely, but if it is important to you you can ask someone familiar with your kind of case in your jurisdiction."}

If the debt remains unsolved, will it affect my eligibility of sponsoring my mom? Thank you!","answer":"First of all, you can always petition your mother. The I-130 petition approval is only about establishing the truth of the relationship. It has nothing to do with your income or anything else. It's at a later stage, after the petition is approved and when she goes through Consular Processing, where they will need an Affidavit of Support from you the petitioner, and where a joint sponsor can be used if needed.Second, when it comes time to need an Affidavit of Support, it's okay even if you (the petitioner) and your household don't have any income. If your household income and\/or assets is insufficient to meet the requirements, a joint sponsor whose household does meet the requirements can be used.Third, debt is not considered for Affidavit of Support purposes. Only income (and optionally assets if income is insufficient)."}
{"question":"I know this isn't politically feasible, but is it legally possible for the United States to abolish copyright? Could the government withdraw from all treaties that require copyright, then repeal all copyright-related laws?I know the Constitution allows copyright, but does it require it to be recognized?","answer":"There is no constitutional requirement that Congress provide copyright protection in the US. Congress could, if it so chooses, repeal Title 17 of the US Code, and afford no copyright protection whatsoever. Given that the US has protected copyright from its earliest days, that copyright protection in English law dates to the 1600s, that almost every nation currently has a Law protecting copyright, and that such protection is a requirement of membership in the World Trade organization (WTO) I find it highly unlikely that such a change in the law will be made in the foreseeable future. But Congress does have the power to abolish copyright in the US."}
{"question":"Recently Chase was making a change to its user agreement and was automatically assuming your consent to abide by binding arbitration unless you opted out explicitly by sending them a snail mail with a self written\/typed, freestyle letter.I now see some user agreement changes from other credit card providers\/banks and it looks like they already have a binding arbitration clause. If I understand this correctly, this prevents me from filing lawsuits against those companies.Is there a way to specifically reach out to these card providers and opt-out of the binding arbitration? I realize this may have more to do with legal than money but it is pertinent in both areas.","answer":"  Is there a way to specifically reach out to these card providers and  opt-out of the binding arbitration?Sure, you can write and ask. But you've signed a binding contract to open an account (or accepted new terms for an existing account) that has a binding arbitration clause in it.Both parties have to agree to renegotiate a contract. Why would a bank renegotiate the contract with you? Or draft a custom contract just for you without arbitration? If you don't like their contract with arbitration terms, there's nothing in it for them; they'll simply say adhere to the contract, or close your account. Or they will close it.But, there can be exceptions; read the credit card agreement. Sometimes there are exceptions for members of the military that allow no arbitration clauses. And sometimes you can opt out of arbitration within the first 90 days of opening an account.

Is there any law which makes mandatory to report your employee to the doctor, health authorities, or whatever for him\/her to make a covid-19 test to check if he has the disease or not, or are the employers completely exempt of this duty?","answer":"There is no Federal or State law currently that has this type of requirement.A lot of employers, especially larger ones, have health screening and may reject an employee access to the property until they are tested, but this is voluntary by the employer (not the employee). For example, my employer asks that we complete an online questionnaire before going to work, and will take our temperature at the door. Anybody who fails the questionnaire or the temperature test is asked to return home until they can pass it. Notice that it doesn't say anything about requiring COVID testing, just that they need to remain home until they've been symptom free for 24 hours.Some other facilities, especially long-term or senior care are mandating that employees are tested, some as much as twice weekly.

{"question":"The US Constitution prohibits the US government from granting titles of nobility (article I, section 9, clause 8).Has it ever been formally established that giving any group, X, a priority of credulity in court over any other group, Y, would amount to granting the group X a title of nobility?The presumption of innocence, at trial, was established in Coffins v US (1894).  This was more than a century after the ratification of the US Constitution.  Which meant that up until then there was some give-n-take allowed on this maxim.However, giving an entire group (such as women) a priority in being believed over an entire other group (such as men) would mean that the former group has a higher standing before the law, by birth-right, than the latter group.  In the 100 years between the ratification of the US Constitution and 'Coffins v US', were there any laws or court decisions which would give any groups de facto nobility over other groups by demanding that their accusations against some other groups must be assumed (if formally stated) true until proven false?  Did the argument that this amounted to granting of titles of nobility (which was prohibited) ever come up in any court cases?","answer":"Has it ever been formally established that giving any group, X, apriority of credulity in court over any other group, Y, would amountto granting the group X a title of nobility?No. This has never been formally established.In the 100 years between the ratification of the US Constitution and&quot;Coffins v US&quot;, were there any laws or court decisions which wouldgive any groups de facto nobility over other groups by demanding thattheir accusations against some other groups must be assumed (ifformally stated) true until proven false?Effectively so. For example, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor works that way and that have been classes of people who have been historically not eligible to serve as witnesses. There are also many procedural circumstances historically (e.g. confessions of judgment) that operate in this manner.Did the argument that this amounted to granting of titles of nobility(which was prohibited) ever come up in any court cases?No.*The core litmus test under the title of nobility prohibition has been that a privilege granted by the government is hereditary and is not simply ordinary property. Without a hereditary component, the title of nobility prohibition does not apply.A lengthy analysis of this jurisprudence can be found in the answer to the Law.SE question &quot;&quot; While this question isn't a true duplicate of that one, the pertinent legal authorities are all discussed in the answers to that question.Obviously, it isn't possible to know every legal argument that was made orally in a trial court or legal brief for all of the United States for all time by everyone and anyone, often leaving no historical record whatsoever. There are no recorded appellate court opinions of which I am aware, however, that engage with this legal argument and rule upon it (which is usually what someone really means when they say &quot;did this argument ever come up in a court case&quot;).Post-ScriptThis post also confounds a &quot;presumption of guilt&quot; with a per se rule regarding credibility determinations, but while both go to the issue of how evidence is evaluated by a tribunal, the two concepts otherwise have nothing in common, and sometimes it isn't clear which is which.For example, in many U.S. jurisdictions, a marriage certificate in existence at the time someone is born, accompanied by the passage of time under a short (often five year) statute of limitations, conclusively prevails on issues of paternity, over a DNA test that is 99.999% certain to be correct as a matter of genetics.You could interpret that as meaning that marriage clerks are always more credible than genetic scientists. But, of course, that isn't really the intent. Instead, this is effectively a substantive rule of law couched as an evidence rule.Similarly, the requirement that real property can only be conveyed in writing could be interpreted as an evidence rule, but it is more realistically viewed as a rule concerning the definition of what a transfer of real property really is that is useful to make a bright line rule. Thus, an oral statement can be a promise to transfer real property, but it doesn't really happen until there is a signed deed or other conveyance.A traffic ticket basically has a presumption of guilt in some jurisdictions, because if you fail to appear you are found guilty in absentia even without evidence, something that is not permitted as a matter of criminal procedure in the U.S. for more serious offenses for which you can be incarcerated. But, on the other hand, if you do appear, the prosecution has the burden of proving that you committed the offense alleged in the ticket.Perhaps the closest example there is to a presumption of guilt (either rebuttable or conclusive, depending upon the statute and facts) is a statutory rape law, which in theory, presumes that someone under a certain age does not have the capacity to consent to intercourse, rendering the offense rape. But, a more straightforward way of understanding those laws is that sex with a minor in the circumstances described is itself illegal without regard to any conclusive presumption of lack of consent.There are also many laws prohibiting certain people from testifying about certain matters in certain circumstances.For example, spouses may not testify against each other in court over a spouse's objection in many kinds of cases. These rights are called &quot;privileges&quot; and are not considered to be titles of nobility.The U.S. Code of Military Justice, intentionally allocates legal rights in these quasi-criminal proceedings in a manner that treats people with different military ranks unequally. Officers have different legal rights than enlisted soldiers, for example. But, since military offices are not hereditary, these rights are not titles of nobility."}

It is a criminal (and possibly civil) wrong under the CFAA. It may also violate some other statute or be in breach of some contract signed by the DDoSer. However, the question was whether the person being DDoSed is legally in the wrong, so: There are a variety of ways an action can be 'illegal.' It could:<h3>Violate some criminal statute<\/h3>This looks promising; after all, US law regarding internet activities is obscenely broad. That said, I can't think of any state or federal statute prohibiting the conduct in question, unless some aspect of it were prohibited under a term of the internet cafe's ToS (more on this possibility later), in which case using the internet cafe's computer in violation of that term might constitute 'unauthorized access' under the CFAA, a federal crime. All of that said, state laws are weird, so there's a very slim outside chance the conduct in question might violate some state law.<h3>Constitute some kind of civil tort<\/h3>This doesn't really hold up either. A civil tort requires that you owe some duty to the person against whom you are allegedly committing the tort and that you cause them damage by violating that duty; I don't see one here.<h3>Breach of Contract<\/h3>Presumably, you agreed to some policy of some flavor when you started using the internet cafe's services. There's an outside chance that it prohibited some conduct (racial epithets, harassment, etc), and that, if your engaging in said conduct caused the other person to DDoS the internet cafe, the cafe could sue you for special damages.

Why is it legal in Russia?","answer":"It is definitely illegal in Russia as well, but the police will do nothing. Previous activity of this group included forcefully attacking people who tried to speak to a girl who disliked it and handling over such people to police to get fined 'for hooliganism'. Usual practice in Russia is to beat the people whom the random girls around dislike. This group stepped a bit further, involving police.They use illegal or questionable methods, definitely. But they use them in a manner that people would be unlikely to complain to police because they themselves either did something illegal or public opinion is not on their side.The police usually will do nothing even with much more serious violations, like beating somebody."}

{"question":"Whereas freedom of the press and freedom of speech are both inalienable rights in our country, the same might not be said of every citizen--particularly members of the military per 10 U.S. Code?888:'Any commissioned officer who uses contemptuous words against the  President, the Vice President, Congress, the Secretary of Defense, the  Secretary of a military department, the Secretary of Homeland  Security, or the Governor or legislature of any State, Commonwealth,  or possession in which he is on duty or present shall be punished as a  court-martial may direct.' (See the answer to )Such measures have been put in place to maintain military cohesiveness. But the same does not apply to the general public and the media. Now we are all well aware of how presidential administrations in the past have fought a very public political battle of words with the media in the United States. The media is a very powerful entity with the power to sway public opinion--not just inform! To the public, these political battles between the media and the President may seem divisive--but to be fair, the media does seem to take political sides, downplaying one party and promoting another. I'm not talking about an opposing political candidate taking swipes at the President and using the media as a vehicle--something for which I understand we already have political campaign regulations in place. No, I'm talking about the perfectly plausible case in which a media outlet itself (without outright endorsement from a specific political party or candidate) makes hostile reporting against the President a constant theme. Please, I'm not pointing fingers--I'm just pointing out that it can and has happened in order to set up the basis of my question.With that in mind, and for our education, how is the President--as Commander In Chief of our armed forces--legally permitted to handle disagreements with the media? Is s\/he also in fact fully entitled to defensively or preemptively discredit or promote media organizations publicly, despite holding office? I am not asking for opinions on whether it's been done the right way or the wrong way by any present or previous administration. I am not at this time pushing for, nor asking for anyone to get on a bandwagon to push for, any changes in policy. My question is also NOT seeking to incite political debate. I just want to deal with the facts of what is legal today in terms of White House communications. I want to understand what legally entitles a President to discredit or promote media organizations as s\/he sees fit. And maybe the answer to that is simply that someone in the office of President keeps his\/her full rights to free speech and free press as a citizen. If so, then just please confirm and point out to me how that's protected, whether by a Constitutional amendment, some simple article in the Bill of Rights, or whatever. That's all! Thanks.","answer":"The answer is as simple as the fact that the President of the US is a civilian and citizen, and keeps his\/her full rights to free speech and free press as guaranteed under the First Amendment.

Their backs are to the camera, and their faces are mostly turned away, but my understanding is that personality rights cover more than identifying features.This was taken in a public park; there is no chance of ever finding these people to get a model release. Am I completely unable to sell this picture, or is it a fuzzier subject? If they were to find this picture and sue me, would I be open to unlimited liability or only for e.g. reasonable royalties?If I didn't charge anything, but gave away prints, would that be any less problematic?For that matter, is it even really legal that I took this picture without permission?Thank you!","answer":"Variations on this question come up a lot:The last of these is closet to your question but I think there is enough distinction that it is not a duplicate.You do not give a jurisdiction; my answer is for Australia.You can take pictures of whoever you please so long as you are in a public place or have the permission of the controller of a private place - there is no right to not be photographed!You own the copyright in a photograph; the subjects of the photograph have no rights to it.You cannot use someone's image for commercial purposes without their permission (i.e. a model release). Using the image as an image is not commercial use. You can sell the image, you can use it in a book and you can put it in a web photo library: you can't use it to promote or sell another product or service that is distinct from the image in such a way that there is or may be the perception that the subjects of the photograph are endorsing that product or service.For completeness, you cannot use or sell images of child abuse - not that this is an issue here.Think about it: if you couldn't take pictures of people without permission there would be no television or newspaper news.  is a request from a major Australian newspaper for images of grand final crowds, they do not ask for model releases. If you look at the first image in the article (see below) it is clear that the 4 subjects have consented to be photographed (not that that is needed) but the people in the background haven't; I am reasonably sure no one signed a model release. Now, if the Daily Telegraph use this to sell their newspaper then that is OK; if they use it in an advertisement for a brand of face paint, wigs or novelty sunglasses it isn't.  Am I completely unable to sell this picture, or is it a fuzzier subject?Sell as many as you can; good luck to you.  If they were to find this picture and sue me, would I be open to unlimited liability or only for e.g. reasonable royalties?You would not be liable for anything  If I didn't charge anything, but gave away prints, would that be any less problematic?It would have the same level of problematic i.e. none.  For that matter, is it even really legal that I took this picture without permission?Yes it is legal."}
{"question":"Instead of a signed release, in recent years I'm seeing posters saying that if you walk in an area you consent to the commercial use of your likeness for unlimited purposes without payment. At least once, I've seen this on a public sidewalk, it wasn't clear where one might walk that would be subject to this release by poster, and the release purported to apply to unaccompanied minors. The language was written the way lawyers write. If the company was smart, they had a video camera to record who saw the poster in case of a lawsuit later, but I doubt most of the companies bother. No one talked to me about it. Since a person reading the poster and walking in the intended area does not thereby receive consideration, there is no contract.I wonder if this has wider implications. Suppose I have a house for sale and it has a walkway to the front door. Could I put up a poster saying that if you walk on the walkway you bought the house, including a mortgage with an interest rate I set, and would the poster be binding? Could I create a website offering website design services with my email address and say that if you email me that constitutes your buying my high-end service as soon as I access your email? Could I paint a poster on the side of a truck with a camera and photograph two million people and say that here are two million identifiable people every one of whom loves my brand of soda and urges you to buy a case? Suppose a park is frequented by published writers, musicians, artists, and inventors of some repute; could I put up a poster by which I acquire all of their intellectual property because they happen to be in the park? The possibilities of consent by poster seem infinite.Or, although I've seen posters like this for at least 5-6 years (one back then was in a business location open to most of the public), has this never been tested in court and is the poster system probably not a valid substitute for a signature, even for mentally competent English-fluent adults not in a rush and allowing that certain contexts wouldn't allow it (e.g., civil court settlements and plea bargains couldn't rely on the poster system)?Or if you didn't have a reason to read the poster (surely no one has to read every writing that's visible) and simply walked through the area in question without reading it you're not bound by it but someone who did happen to read it must accept its terms?If the geographical boundaries are unclear so that reading the poster gives you no clear remedy by walking away, does that change the law on the validity of consent by poster?Website terms often say that using the website constitutes consent to the terms and often reading the terms to discover this requires using the website before you start reading, but I doubt that's legal consent, but maybe consent will be found after you've read them and didn't try to revoke consent, e.g., by not using the site any longer.In the United States, this all might well vary by state and may depend on common law.","answer":"I gather that the numerous ramifications you outline are merely contexts and that your main concern is about the application of contract law (contract law in the U.S. does not really vary among states). Thus, I will not really delve in the intricacies of --for instance-- privacy or copyright issues arising from the commercial use of a person's likeness that you mention in one of the scenarios.As a starting point, one needs to bear in mind that:a contract is an exchange of considerations under terms and conditions entered knowingly and willfully by the parties, which can be evidenced by the parties' subsequent conduct (that is, not just by signing a document); anda contract is unenforceable if it contravenes public policy and\/or the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Accordingly, the questions are (1) whether a person knew or reasonably should have known about the terms &amp; conditions at or by the time of those events which trigger obligations pursuant to the contract; and (2) whether the provisions therein are unreasonable, illegal, or tantamount to a penalty, especially in the event that the party breaches or repudiates the alleged contract (see the  at 356(2)).The scenario of house for sale entails various difficulties as per contract law and otherwise. Here are some of those issues:Are visitors properly (including 'beforehand') notified about the 'walkway clause'? If not, the contract is void because it cannot be said that visitors knew about &amp; accepted that condition.Does the house provide alternatives for lawful &amp; informed visitors to safely avoid the walkway? If not, then the seller\/owner might end up incurring premises liability with respect to those visitors who get injured in making their reasonable effort not to trigger the 'walkway clause'.Is the house owner realistically able to prove that use of the walkway by lawful &amp; informed visitors is sufficiently 'inconsistent with the offeror's ownership of offered property' so that triggering a house sale is a reasonable consequence (see Restatement at69(2))?Is the owner-imposed mortgage rate compliant with state law pertaining to granting of credit &amp; loans?These exemplify only some of the burdensome complications when trying to enforce 'contracts' which are extravagant or quite one-sided.Lastly, as a side note, the presumption that   a person reading the poster and walking in the intended area does not thereby receive considerationis not necessarily accurate. As an example, the 'intended area' could have been devised by an entity in the business of enjoyment and recreation, such as a private park. The person who deliberately walks in (regardless of whether he read the poster) certainly receives a consideration, which is the amusement or recreation for which the park was designed."}
{"question":"BackgroundPiggy backing off the question about .  But I'm not sure if the same rules necessarily apply to U.S. attorneys of the Federal Government.QuestionWhen a U.S. Attorney files charges acting in his office, does this automatically mean that the DoJ itself is the party filing a charge?","answer":"No. The U.S. Attorney brings charges on behalf of the United States, which is the filing party, at least in criminal cases. That's why every criminal case is styled 'United States v. [Whomever].'"}
{"question":"I was recently served a complaint stating I owe one year's rent on a housing lease I mistakenly renewed.I did not live on the property the whole year.  When reading the contract, it states that this is a limited license housing agreement, not a lease. I was not made aware of this during signing, and management did not point out the difference to me during signing. The property is also advertised as a student apartment,and makes no obvious distinction that potential renters would be signing a housing license, not a lease. I was also never notified that I should contact an attorney prior to signing.","answer":"A 'limited license housing agreement' may be an interesting attempt to get around landlord-tenant laws, typically associated with official student housing (e.g.  in case they declare the contract to be an agreement as opposed to a lease. It is possible that this is copy-and-paste law that erroneously relies on provisions in landlord-tenant laws that exempt university housing agreements from provisions of a state's landlord-tenancy law. You do not need to be informed that you should \/ could consult an attorney before signing a legal document: this knowledge is presupposed. It is also assumed that when you sign a document, you read the document. It is reasonably likely that the lease contained language like the following (from the above contract):  I have carefully read, fully understand and voluntarily sign this  Housing Agreement.  Once fully signed, this is a binding  contract   and  is  intended  to  be  enforceable  under  its  terms.  I have had  the opportunity to seek independent  legal  adviceThe disclaimer 'This Housing Agreement is not a lease and no tenancy, leasehold, possessory or other property interest in any specific apartment or bedroom is created' has dubious legal status. The rights given by the landlord-tenant act cannot be waived, under the , so saying 'this is not a lease' does not make the lease not a lease.In Michigan there is a duty on landlords to mitigate loses when a premise is abandoned. The case , 252 N.W.2d 832 however establishes that there is such a general duty for any breach of contract (and even applies it to breach of a rental agreement). So whether or not you call it a lease, there is still a duty to mitigate losses.In the scenario where you abandoned the unit and the landlord waited until the end of the year to file an action for breach of contract, they could have failed in their duty to mitigate their losses (but see Fox v. Roethlisberger, where landlord did make an effort to re-rent, and simply was not able to for 9 months)."}
{"question":"Clearly, every country has its own medical system. I do not know what the single source of legality tends to be, but I assume the government appoints a minister of health, and the minister of health somehow oversees who is allowed to practice medicine, how, and where, and who will be in charge of important topics like drug legality and medical ethics. Apparently, the World Health Organization has an international health standard that is legally binding in 196 countries. ()Does that mean it is legally possible to create an international telemedicine product (as in, as much of health services as possible, like talking to a doctor, or getting medicine delivered, fast through an app)? The company would provide the same service but adapt it to any medical regulations of each country. In fact, the company would mainly be a vendor of a medium between doctors and patients already existing and practicing, in each country.However, I guess my point was precisely that - internationalizing health care. In theory, in the global, digital times, it does not make that much sense that an American living in Germany could not get telemedicine from America with the same level of convenience - for example, German insurance covering it, and the American prescription being somewhat valid.Maybe that is how things already are. People do sometimes have to travel for medical treatment and country's medical systems do have to permit a degree of interoperability.I guess the bottom line is that medicine is like any other sector, every country is its own authority and creates its own system, including law, business, education, etc.What I'm trying to figure out is if that means it is already totally possible for an international telemedicine service which can connect you with a doctor in any country and give a prescription; but you would just need to figure out how to use that diagnosis in your country.My conclusion is I think this is legal. Is there some aspect of this I don't know about?","answer":"It is not, generally, legal. Each locations has one or more government empowered bodies that set the rules for who can practice medicine under what circumstances with what constraints, within their borders.What medications can be prescribed by whom and fulfilled by whom are also regulated.In the US, at least, COVID has made it clear that states need to modify policies to accelerate telemedicine across borders but it is not in place in the US and certainly not worldwide."}
{"question":"When a person is convicted of a crime and required to perform community service, what exactly is involved?","answer":"It means Community service work can include a range of tasks, from the maintenance of public spaces, to preparing meals for community events. Work can be ongoing, seasonal or one-off, and cannot replace the work of paid employees.Community Corrections has partnerships with community, government and non-government organisations to provide community service work opportunities for offenders. These organisations are known as community service work partners', and benefit from accessing labour for work that would otherwise be unable to be completed."}
{"question":"In Los Angeles, California, the victim of a robbery identifies his attacker as beingone of three identical triplets (and the victim saw nobody but the one attacker).If the three triplets all live in separate homes, can the police get a searchwarrant for any of their homes (assuming no other evidence\/motive)?I would say each has 33% probability of being guilty, so my interpretation isthat there is not \"probable cause\" (i.e., 50%) to search anyone's home...really?","answer":"A couple of SCOTUS decisions bearing on this are , 462 U.S. 213, where the courts took pains to deny that &quot;probable cause&quot; is related to a number. From Texas v. Brown,the Court frequently has remarked, probable cause is a flexible,common-sense standard. It merely required that the facts available tothe officer would &quot;warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief,&quot;Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 267 U. S. 162 (1925), thatcertain items may be contraband or stolen property or useful asevidence of a crime; it does not demand any showing that such a beliefbe correct, or more likely true than false. A &quot;practical,nontechnical&quot; probability that incriminating evidence is involved isall that is required. Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160From Illinois v. Gates,The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical,common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forthin the affidavit before him, there is a fair probability thatcontraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.And the duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that themagistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable causeexisted.The question is framed in terms of probability that a certain individual is guilty, but that is not the basis for issuing a search warrant. Rather, a warrant may be issued if there is a fair probability that evidence bearing on a crime will be found. That would include evidence that exonerates a person (the system is not set up to only favor convictions). It would be highly impractical to assign a numeric value to probability of finding evidence, since there is more to the matter than just declaring &quot;It must have been one of these three people&quot;."}
{"question":"Federal Immigration and Nationality Act Section 8 USC 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv)(b)(iii) saysAny person who encourages or induces an alien to reside in the United States, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such residence is in violation of law, shall be punished as provided - for each alien in respect to whom such a violation occurs fined under title 18, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.That said, does it follow that it would be a violation of Federal law for a government official to declare a state\/city to be a 'sanctuary state\/city' for the specific purpose of harboring and protecting unauthorised immigrants from lawful deportation?","answer":"No, it does not follow. Mostly, because that's not what is actually happening with sanctuary cities. First, there is no actual definition of a sanctuary city, neither in the law or, more specifically, in immigration policy. . Section 1373(a) of Title 8 of US Code states that local and state governments are prohibited from enacting laws or policies limiting the exchange of info re: citizenship w\/Department of Homeland Security. So if you work for the local Department of Human Services, and someone shows up to sign up for public benefits and you find out they are undocumented immigrants, if you wanted to report that person to ICE, no government could forbid you from doing so. Conversely, the federal government can't force you to report that undocumented immigrant. Likewise, the detainers that ICE issues, which are requests to the local government to inform them when a given undocumented immigrant is to be released, are not mandatory. If that action is taken, the jail can hold the undocumented immigrant up to 48 hours for ICE to act. If ICE doesn't act, the person must be let go. A report by the DOJ's inspector general looked at a random sampling of cities that receive federal funding and found that each of them had certain policies in place that limited cooperation with ICE and ICE's detainers. However, the same inspector general found that Section 1373 is not applicable to detainers. In sum, the IG determined that, although there were no explicit policies forbidding state or local employees from cooperating with ICE, non-compliance with detainers in some jurisdictions at the very least were 'inconsistent with ... the intent of Section 1373.' Legal arguments abound. One argument is that the administration is interpreting Section 1373 too broadly in order to include both types of sanctuary cities. Another is that Section 1373 violates the anti-comandeering doctrine of the 10th Amendment. I guess the real answer is, 'stay tuned,' but for now, no it does not follow that it is a violation of federal law for a government official to declare a state\/city to be a 'sanctuary city.' "}
{"question":"The questionLayman here. This question was inspired by  and random things I've heard\/read over the years.I'm quite confused by a concept that comes up again and again and which people seem to hold for self-evident. And that concept is that there is some evidence which a court will refuse to admit. And that confuses be because... well, there's evidence. It leads to the truth. Why aren't you taking it?!It's very easy to come up with realistic examples where:There is a piece of evidence which is clearly and irrefutably shows that a person did something very bad (say, murder)This evidence is for whatever reason \"not admissible\" (say, it was obtained illegally)And there is no other piece of evidence that would incriminate this person.Does that mean that the perpetrator gets to go free? How can the court refuse to admit evidence, especially if it's the only useful evidence existing? And if yes, then why is this so and where is this practice useful?Some examples from the top of my headThe example question above deals with unlawful searches. Imagine that a police officer decided to search a car (or an apartment) and forcefully did so against the protests of the owner (or maybe the owner wasn't even present). They thought they might find drugs or something, but instead they are surprised to discover a dead body, clearly murdered. So... now what? According to the above question, since the search was illegal, this is inadmissible evidence in the court. Does that mean that the owner of the car\/apartment gets to go away scott-free? Do they launch a new investigation and try to find other evidence except the fact that it was inside the property of this guy here (and failing to do that, release them)? If the owner of the car\/apartment says \"I don't know what you're talking about, I last saw Jimmy here alive and well at the pub last night; I never seen his corpse before.\" - can they call him out on the obvious lie?Or, another example. I don't know about USA, but here in Europe it's illegal to record someone's phone calls without a warrant (or something like that; it's serious). Any recordings obtained unlawfully will be inadmissible as evidence.Let's now imagine that I've gone the full extra mile and have secretly bugged everything in my neighbour's house because I suspect (but have no evidence) that they murdered my child last month. I've got hidden cameras, microphones everywhere, etc. So one day I catch him talking to his spouse on the phone and mentioning the murder, admitting to doing it, and even telling where he buried the body.Now I have evidence... or do I? I give the recording to the police, they search the indicated place and they do find the body, but since they cannot accept my recording as evidence... does that mean that my neighbour now has no consequences? Let's also suppose that no other evidence is found that would indicate his guilt (the guy was thorough). Obviously I'd get some grief for bugging my neighbour's house, but do I now also become the prime suspect in the murder of my own child? After all - the recording of my neighbour's confession \"officially doesn't exist\", and I'm the one who told the police where to dig, so...","answer":"that confuses be because... well, there's evidence. It leads to the truth. Why aren't you taking it?!Firstly, because whether a piece of evidence actually leads to &quot;the truth&quot; is usually arguable. The parties will normally have different views on whether it does.For example, someone saying something about what they saw\/heard is evidence. But is the person to be believed? Are they available to repeat the evidence from the witness stand, or are only their words available (as heard\/recorded by someone)?And then, very importantly, the courts do not actually seek &quot;the truth&quot;. It's a common misconception that they do. Instead, they resolve the dispute between the parties.So, rules have been worked out over the centuries as to how disputes are to be resolved. These include rules of evidence."}
{"question":"For today's exercise into comic book law, let's take a look at another X-men storyline.As we . Let's take the synopsis as following as true as the amalgamation of which facts both stories tell:Senator Robert Kelly is assassinated in 1980 (1973 in the film) by a carrier of the X-Gene.As a result, Kelly's advocating for funding the Sentinel Program by Bolivar Trask is getting traction.The publicly known target of the Sentinel Program is to hunt down and kill X-Gene carriers, especially US Citizens.The funding goes through and Trask starts building hunter-killer robots for the government.For our analysis, let's stop here, as the rest of the plot is time-travel shenanigans. Does the funding count as government action, making the program an action or law that violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment?","answer":"Government funding does make it a government action, however, it's important to note that the law in the story that funded the sentinels could have resulted in unintended consequences for the bad future.Considering that the Sentinels were capable of detecting mutants at the time and had been since their introduction 16 years prior to the publication of this story.  It would make sense that in the wake of an assassination of a U.S. Senator by known mutant criminals, the general public mood turned to favor a screening system that would want better screening and protection against mutants... similar to how the President riding in convertible Motorcades stopped following Kennedy's assassination in real life OR the increase of TSA restrictions on items one can take on airplanes following the 9\/11 attacks.Thus the Sentinels were funded to act only as a security deterrence.  At the time of the story, the Sentinels were the only system that could identify Mutants AND carry enough onboard weapons systems to neutralize them.  It would have been sold to the public as a security tool.  Nothing more than a cop with a gun and a metal detector.Of course, the Sentinels being an AI, had in prior stories gone off mission from taking their job to an extreme (Their debut story had them turn on non-mutant humans because non-mutants gave birth to mutants and thus were the source of mutants... they were only stopped when Cyclops tricked them by exploiting this logic and explaining that humans weren't the true source of mutation, the sun was, which convinced the entire fleet of Sentinels to try and stop the sun... and went about as well as you would think).   This is a consistent fatal flaw, and by the 2013 storyline, it's implied Sentinels had gone off the rails, usurped the U.S. government, and were now working to nuke the world because killing everyone would stop mutation from occurring.   Essentially, it was a Skynet scenario where the computer AI was operating on a &quot;Garbage In, Garbage Out&quot; programing, and by the time the people in power could do anything about it, the Sentinels had too much power to be stopped.At one point in the storyline, future!Kitty walks by a graveyard and narrates that by this point, the Sentinels had targeted the non-mutant heroes of Marvel as well (including Spider-Man, Dare Devil, the Fantastic Four, and a good number of the Avengers (at the time of publishing, none of the heroes could be counted as mutants because Mutants were defined in the Marvel comics as people who were innately born with their powers, whereas all of the heroes were non-mutants who developed their powers due to outside forces they interacted with.).As such, it's possible the law was compliant with the Constitution (After all, you do have to go through a metal detector when you go to Congress and other government buildings... why not a Mutant detector... you know... just to be sure...)."}

{"question":"Virginia's governor issued a stay at home order' that will be enforced by fines, and is in effect until June 10th, unless otherwise revoked. This includes the ban on groups of 10 or more.All public and private in-person gatherings of more than ten individuals are prohibited. This includes parties, celebrations, religious, or other social events, whether they occur indoor or outdoor. This restriction does not apply:a. To the operation of businesses not required to close to the public under Executive Order 53; orb. To the gathering of family members living in the same residence.Violation of paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this Order shall be a Class 1 misdemeanor pursuant to 44-146.17 of the Code of Virginia.I know Maryland and DC are implementing nearly identical orders, and most likely other states are also doing so, or considering doing so in the near future.A pastor in Florida was arrested for holding religious services with more than 10 people, .This seems to move much deeper into strict scrutiny territory for questioning the Constitutionality of these orders, for example under the First Amendment,Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.which is applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.While orders lasting for a few weeks may be easy to call narrowly tailored, can the same be said for orders lasting months? And what about enforcement of these restrictions in communities that don't even have any confirmed cases of the virus? Sure, it feels like it's everywhere but for some states it's still only in the major metropolitan areas, leaving a lot of small communities alone (so far). A state-wide ban lasting for months that so heavily affects both the rights of assembly and worship, with potential fines and arrests for violation, is at least clearly less narrowly tailored than the previous orders. Whether the circumstance they are trying to avoid is worth this or not will be a pretty tricky question.On the other hand, we all know that none of this is likely to be litigated until after it's all over, simply because most of the courts are also closed except for the most critical needs, so there's no one to raise the question to. At best, we may see some fines or convictions overturned in the future, but nothing to stop the continuation of the orders right now. Is there a precedent of such circumstances?","answer":"There is a potentially infinite regress of questions regarding the constitutionality of restrictions imposed under these 'emergency' circumstances. The basic legal principle is clearly established: laws restricting fundamental rights are subject to strict scrutiny. The specific details of a particular law and surrounding circumstances have yet to be discovered by the courts. If it is necessary to the purpose of saving lives that meetings of more than 10 people be prohibited, then the 'compelling interest' test probably has been satisfied. That is basically a medical question, and the courts have a limited interest in scientific controversies, instead they are interested in whether people who make legal decisions do so rationally (is it reasonable to think that such limits would accomplish that compelling government end). Is it reasonable to think that restrictions lasting two months are necessary? The Black Death lasted at least 4 years. In the current circumstances (very limited hard knowledge this disease), it's hard to say what government actions could not be excused based on necessity.Summary execution is, at least in the current knowledge context, probably not going to pass strict scrutiny. As already explained in other thread on the topic, there is no 'churches are above the law' constitutional provision.

{"question":"I'm familiar with the so-called ethics\/law divide, where some acts may be lawful but unethical and other acts ethical but unlawful. This question is not about this.I'm also familiar with professional Codes of Ethics that gain 'legal' force by virtue of contract law and\/or incorporation into professional regulatory statutes, but generally only apply to certified or licensed professionals (e.g. non-physicians do not incur liability by behaving in ways that are inconsistent with contemporary medical ethics but are otherwise lawful). This question is not about this either.Has US law ever imposed a general duty on the general public to behave ethically? Restated, has a court ever imposed liability on a private citizen (holding no professional licensure or certification, holding no public office, etc.) for behavior that did not violate any specific provision of criminal or civil law, but rather transgressed either normative community ethics or the court's view as to what such ethics ought to be?I used to think that it would be absurd for there to be 'purely ethical' liability, but I found  article by an attorney in Arizona, who seems to be primarily talking about professional ethics (not general citizen ethics), but states that a court could theoretically punish on the basis of transgressing an ethical rule that has broad community acceptance but that had not been formally accepted by or imposed on the defendant by specific legal process.If asking about the United States in general is too broad, we can limit it to the state of New York.","answer":"A general obligation to behave ethically would quickly be struck down as unconstitutional deprivation of due process under the void-for-vagueness doctrine.

Also are performance licensing agents like ASCAP region specific like they only have the license for performances in the US or is it global?I'm guessing this would not apply to like a kids or junior varsity team or their coaches playing the songs on their phone? Is the way that these apps work legal?Would this answer about safe harbor laws from another question be applicable:  ?","answer":"An app or site is not required to try to vet user uploads for copyright infringement.If the site operator is in the US and wants the DMCA Safe Harbor, then the site must offer a way to file takedown notices, and must respond to them properly (as described in more detail in the linked answer). If the operator does not accept takedown notices, the operator may be liable if an infringement suit is brought. If it fulfills the safe harbor requirements, then the site operator cannot be held liable in any such suit.There are similar Safe Harbor laws in many countries.But it is in no way illegal to allow uploads of possibly copyrighted content, and not investigate the copyright status until and unless a complaint is made by the copyright owner or the owner's agent in proper form.The specific US law here is . This provides, in relevant part:(c)(1) In general.A service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief, or, except as provided in subsection (j), for injunctive or other equitable relief, for infringement of copyright by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider, if the service provider(c)(1)(A)(i) does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing;(c)(1)(A)(ii) in the absence of such actual knowledge, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent; or(c)(1)(A)(iii) upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material;...(c)(3)(B)(i) Subject to clause (ii), a notification from a copyright owner or from a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner that fails to comply substantially with the provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not be considered under paragraph (1)(A) in determining whether a service provider has actual knowledge or is aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.If an upload is made and processed by automatic means, without the personal intervention of the site operator or a member of the operator's staff, it is not usually considered that the operator has 'actual knowledge&quot; of its infringing nature.Whether, by providing facilities to upload form Amazon or similar commercial sources, the operator has awareness of &quot;facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent&quot; is a question I do not know if any court has addressed. The operator could perhaps claim that s\/he expects such a limited use to fall under fair use or a similar exception. In the absence of a takedown or similar notice from the copyright owner, it might be hard to successfully sue the operator \/>However, the user who publicly plays a piece of copyrighted music without obtaining permission is committing infringement (unless fair use or anothe exception applies). The copyright owner may choose not to sue small non-commercial users, but could sue if the owner chose to sue, and might well win such a suit.The most common legal way for a club or school to play such music in public is to pay royalties to the copyright holder. Many countries, including the US have schemes operated by music associations that allow automatic licensing on payment of the royalty to them and they manage the disbursement to the copyright holder.However, if fair use validly applies, then it is perfectly legal to play the music without obtaining permission or paying any royalty. whether this applies depends on the specific facts, and varies case-by-case."}
{"question":"In the United States, there are certain situations where you must pay a fine that government in the United States puts upon someone.However, is it legal to impose a fine greater than what a person is capable of paying? Let's say a homeless man (no income, no assets) commits a felony, and must pay back a fine of $100,000. Is that legal? Most laws say that X felony\/misdemeanor deserves 'a maximum of $X fine, X amount of years imprisonment, or both.' Anyone can serve imprisonment. Not everyone can pay a fine. If it is, what happens when they don't pay the fine? Can the fine incrue interest? Can you declare bankruptcy on a fine?","answer":"Bankruptcy does not obliterate legal financial obligations (taxes that you owe, fines, etc.).Fines either , seemingly small fines can balloon to large sums (they cite an example of a 4-fold increase in initial fine owing to interest and similar increases."}
{"question":"Suppose there is open conflict between an executive administration and the federal judicial branch.  The executive branch wants to curtail judicial power, but is hopefully limited by the Constitution in what it can do.  Presumably there is also a certain precedence and decorum that discourages such conflicts from escalating.  That said, were such a situation to escalate, would the executive have actions they could take that would weaken the judiciary?  Likewise, does the judiciary have any proactive defenses against such measures?My understanding is that Article III judges are fairly well protected from retaliation by their lifetime appointment.  Rude remarks aside, are there actions that could, in practice, weaken their powers or imperil their jobs?","answer":"Long-term, the federal executive could influence the federal judiciary by the judicial nominations they make.The executive could also influence the political will of the people to cause legislative change affecting the judiciary (change court composition, impeachments, quorum rules, original standing exclusivity, specialist circuits, senior status privileges, salaries, etc.) But, this is mediated through the legislative branch, with its power spread thin, and close to the people.Aside from those political tactics, the executive only has unlawful force and disobedience to weaken the judiciary, and even those methods of disobedience have institutional checks: contempt of court charges and legislative branch impeachment of the executive."}
{"question":"A friend of mine studies at an American university in the UAE. Recently, he was literally escorted out of the campus building on the premise that it was winter break.It is a common notion that the university remains closed during the winter break, but he is a full-time student and was on the campus for more than 24 hours. The university is heavily guarded and is always monitored by a Public Safety department which is actually run by a multinational security corporation (originally based in the US). The presence of my friend was already known and he has been a student for more than 3 years. He was working on a project, and is a kind of person who gets lost very easily in work. First night, he crashed in during the night because he lives in a far away city (in his case, Dubai) and continued working on his project the next day as well. The university is a very student-focused Liberal Arts university, and he was in no way ready for what was to happen.While he was working in one of the labs which is usually 24x7 for student use, two security guards approached him and asked him to leave the campus immediately. The demeanor of the guards was very rough and they kicked out this student and asked him actually to leave the campus (entirely) at around midnight. Now, my friend is literally left devastated by this act which they carried out on him at midnight. He now hates his university and is scared of the Public Safety officers (who are supposed to protect him). He immediately wrote to them asking what the actual protocol was for some student who would come to campus during a break, but hasn't received a response since (almost ten days now).Can he sue the company managing the Public Safety department (for the psychological damage he received)? He has witnesses, including me. On what grounds can he file a case?EDIT: The university is a residential education-based university that means students live there 24x7 except during the break, and during that time only the housing is shut but all the other major facilities are accessible. So all the places my friend accessed were done so using his university issued RFID-based ID card. So far, the Public Safety department has not given any official reply to his question about what the actual protocol is. It seems that there was no such protocol to deal with such a case in the first place but the security officers on duty that night just did it on a whim.","answer":"So to summarise: Your friend was on another person's property. Authorised officers of the property owner asked him to leave and ensured that he did leave.Please explain in that fact pattern where there is an unlawful act or omission? Apart from your friend's possible trespass if they were there without permission.I am sorry that your friend is &quot;devastated&quot; and &quot;hates university&quot; and &quot;is scared&quot; but I cannot see how your friend's emotional and psychological fragility is the university's problem. Hurt feelings are not legal damages. Indeed, everyone is legally entitled to hurt other people's feelings - it's called &quot;free speech&quot;."}

It is one who bought at a fair price or what s\/he believed to be a fair price.  It is one who bought because s\/he desired to own the property.

{"question":"I am a Cyber Security student just starting on a course the depends heavily on the use of court cases that used electronically stored information to determine the verdict of a case. Are there a few database-like resources that would allow me to easily search for such cases? ","answer":"U.S. answer only.  Are there a few database-like resources that would allow me to easily  search for such cases?It is balkanized. It also isn't entirely clear what information about the cases interests you.Almost all federal court filings (but not administrative law decisions) are in a database called PACER.Each state has its own system. Some are almost completely unified, and in others, there are many databases.In Colorado, for example, the Colorado E-Filing system has all filings in state courts, but courts outside the state court system, mostly the Denver County Court and municipal courts, as well as some major private arbitration firms, are on their own and most subcontract the job to a division of LexisNexis, a private firm. In both cases, access to these filings is not free except to parties, and has lots of data with access restricted to parties and the court. Published appellate court decisions are also available at an Internet based source. None of these covers administrative law decisions in Colorado, however.Administrative law decisions are usually kept by the agency and also often by a commercial firm that compiles them. Some of them do not give the public access to the decisions in the absence of a FOIA or open records act request.Commercial firms like Westlaw and LexisNexis and several less well known firms (including a free one run by Cornell University), keep databases of published decisions of appellate courts plus a somewhat random assortment of unpublished decisions, with federal court trial court decisions getting much more heavy coverage than state court trial decisions and unpublished state appellate court decisions. But, these are only key court orders, not all filings in the case, and are not the true source documents.There is also a non-profit consortium that maintains a database of court records from the 75 most populous counties in the United States, and there is a private firm that keeps selective track of jury verdicts to the fullest extent that it can obtain them. Some credit reporting agencies (both consumer credit and business credit agencies) maintain databases of judgments and liens."}

{"question":"Alice creates a non-fungible token (NFT) of a digital file that they do not own copyright of.  She adds the token to the ethereum blockchain, and creates a transaction that transfers it to a wallet controlled by Bob.  Bob does not download the blockchain, but keeps his keys safe.  Charlie knows nothing about this exchange, but downloads the blockchain and mines the block that represents the transaction.  Dawn also has the blockchain, and downloads the newly mined block and adds it to her copy (as does everyone else in the world with a copy of the blockchain).It seems to me that the NFT is a derivative work of the original file, and therefore if Alice was located in the US she would be breaching copyright in creating the NFT, and in distributing it by adding it to the blockchain.  Bob has never seen the NFT and has never created a copy of it, but has the theoretical ability to create transactions involving it that would be recognised as valid by others.  Charlie has created a copy of the NFT (by downloading the blockchain) and distributed a derivative (by publishing the mined block) but has no knowledge of any infringing activity. Dawn has created a copy of the NFT.If Alice was in the US, and therefore breaching copyright law in creating the NFT, are Bob, Charlie and\/or Dawn either committing any crimes, or exposing themselves to potential civil charges?If Alice was in a jurisdiction which did not recognise the copyright on the original work (perhaps ?) does this change the situation?  What about if Charlie is?","answer":"NFTs typically link to the file, but do not include it. Thus, no copyright concerns apply.Specifically: NFTs have an opaque identifier that ensures each NFT is unique. You can ascribe any meaning you want to to these identifiers, for example that a particular token identifier represents the Mona Lisa, and that another ID represents this answer.However, the NFT can have associated metadata. This metadata contains a description of the thing represented by the token, e.g. a URL that links to some artwork. For details on the most common NFT systems, see the specifications .Of course, the metadata could include copyrighted material, e.g. a poem or a binary encoding of an image. However, it would be very expensive to create such a large token."}
{"question":"In reading this thread:It made me wonder... What responsibility do parents have to keep and maintain the property of their children? An example here would be when a young child  infant, toddler, pre-adolescent   receives gifts for birthdays, Christmas, etc.  They will outgrow these in short-order, stop playing with them, etc.In the referenced thread, the consensus seems to be that those gifts belong solely to the child and the parent has no claim over them.  So, as a parent, are we obligated to hold them in storage until a child reaches an age where they can grant consent for us to dispose of them?  At what age could a child grant such consent?  And, if we dispose of them sooner, are we ultimately committing a crime (i.e. theft)?As the child's legal guardian, do we not have ultimate say over their legal affairs until they turn 18, and if so, would we not have legal authority over the management (including disposal, sale, transfer, etc.) of their assets?  Isn't such control a basic tenant of guardianship?","answer":"The parent is a This has been explicitly acknowledged in many common law jurisdictions and is likely true in all of them.A  is a person in a position of legal or ethical trust with respect to another person.A fiduciary duty is the highest standard of care in equity or law. A fiduciary is expected to be extremely loyal to the person to whom he owes the duty (the &quot;principal&quot;) such that there must be no conflict of duty between fiduciary and principal, and the fiduciary must not profit from their position as a fiduciary.[ (unless the principal consents). The nature of fiduciary obligations differs among jurisdictions. In Australia, only proscriptive or negative fiduciary obligations are recognised,[ whereas in Canada, fiduciaries can come under both proscriptive (negative) and prescriptive (positive) fiduciary obligations.Other recognised fiduciary relationships are: director to company,trustee to beneficiaries, lawyer to client, teacher to student, and guardian to ward.A fiduciary has the legal right (and obligation) to deal with the assets of the principal but that dealing must be in the principal's interest (as a reasonable fiduciary would see it - company directors are required to use business judgement; not to be right) without consideration of whether it is good for the fiduciary.A parent can clearly dispose of worthless (or near worthless) assets of the child with or without the consent and knowledge (subject to age and reasonableness) of the child so long as they make that decision in the best interests of the child.Control in that manner is basic tenant of guardianship because a guardian is a fiduciary."}
{"question":"In , a Federal judge set aside a guilty verdict by the jury.Why was the case even being heard by a judge, rather than an appellate court?From the news story, it appears that the judge was second guessing the jury, in other words he apparently decided the facts of the case did not merit a conviction. I thought the only time a judge or appellate court can reverse a jury on a question of fact was if there was a 'gross miscarriage of justice'. Has that standard changed? Can judges now set aside jury verdicts if they just disagree with the jury's interpretation of the facts?  ","answer":"The case was heard by a jury, Sorokin was the presiding judge. He ruled on a defense motion for a judgment of acquittal, which is why the matter was not (yet) heard by an appeal court. The only public explanation at the moment is that   After a careful review of the entire record in this case, including  the parties' substantial post-trial briefs, the Court takes the  unusual step of setting aside the jury's guilty verdicts and directing  the entry of verdicts of NOT GUILTY as to both Brissette and Sullivan  on all charges. This action is required based on the government's  failure to prove that either man committed the charged offenses."}

If a higher court finds that Chauvin's right to an impartial jury was violated, could he be subject to a retrial?Did the prosecution oppose the defense's request for a change in venue?   Could such opposition have any impact on the appeal process?","answer":"YesThe normal remedy for not receiving a fair trial or due process is the declaration of a mistrial. A mistrial legally never happened so it is up to the prosecution to decide if they want a retrial.Unless the appellant can demonstrate that no reasonable jury would have convicted on the evidence (which seems unlikely verging on impossible), the appeal will not acquit the accused."}
{"question":"I have many times heard jokes related to females who have \"long\" names, such as \"Marianne Doe Smith Swensson O'Reilly And More Last Names Go Here\", suggesting that they have been married multiple times and, each time after getting divorced, still kept their husbands' last names, \"piling them on\" like a form of intangible \"baggage\" of sorts.I always wondered why they would do this unless required by law. Is there such a law that says that they cannot \"nuke\" last names once they get them, but are only allowed to \"pile on\" the new one to the ever-growing list of last names? Perhaps as a way to signal that it's not a good idea to get married to somebody who's obviously prone to divorces?If this is not the case today, has it been the case in the past? I wonder about this both for the USA and the Western world in general.","answer":"In the USA, at least, it has never, to the best of my information, been legally mandated to add a name on marriage, or even for husband and wife have the same last name. It has long been customary in the US for a woman on marriage, to adopt her husband's surname. This is no not nearly as common as it once was -- it was once almost invariable, but some women did not do so, or kept a pre-marrige name for professional purposes, even many generations ago.When a woman married, in some social sub-groups it was common to simply drop her former surname and replace it with her new husband's surname. In others, the new surname was added to her existing name, potentially leading to the kind of long series of names mentions in the question. In the 1990s Judith Martin, writing as &quot;Miss Manners&quot;, wrote that the first of these was the more &quot;traditional&quot; but both were not uncommon.When I was married, the clerk asked my wife and I what name each of us would be known by after the marriage, and that constituted a legal change of name. But we were free to make any choice we wanted. I think this has been the usual procedure in the US for a long time now.On divorce, a woman in the US (and the UK and Canada) traditionally kept her former husband's last name, although some returned to a pre-marriage surname. On remarriage, some added a new husband's surname, others replaced the former husband's name. Some said that keeping the former husband's name was a statement that  the woman had been without fault in the divorce, or want to remain associated in some way with her former husband's family.  There were, of course, also women who remarried after a former husband's death, rather than a divorce. In any case, I do not think any of this was legally required, but custom can sometimes be as strong as law.Other cultures had and have different customs on marriage and divorce. But in most places these are not a matter of law. I do not know of any country that legally mandates a change or modification of name on marriage, but some may."}
{"question":"Does a company have to buy a license for a technology if the technology was developed simultaneously? Let's say that a company A and a company B developed technology C at the same time, but company B applied for the patent first and ended up with the patent. Does company A have to pay a licensing fee to company B if company A can prove that the technology they're using was developed independently at the same time in court, or is it first-apply-gets-all? You can assume that this is in the U.S.","answer":"Before the AIA in 2012 both companies could apply for a patent and if one of the applicants thought they were both trying to patent the same thing they could initiate an interference proceeding. In that proceeding before the board, they each present their evidence as to date of conception and diligent effort from that point to the date of the first filing. The board decided which application went forward.Now the U.S. is with the rest of the world in first-to-file. It doesn't matter who conceived first unless one actually stole the idea from the other. There is a new derivation procedure to try to prove that. I don't think it has ever yet happened.One of the &quot;simultaneous&quot; inventors could publish the invention, putting into the public domain. If published before the other's filing date, it would theoretically prevent the other from getting a patent.In any case a patent owner can stop the other from making their product or charge a royalty. There is a narrow case under the AIA where one company has been using a process that another later patents and can retain a limited right to keep using that process but can't move or expand operations. This is called Prior User Rights."}

It also has not been a legal issue whether it is infringement if you change one of the works when you copy it, thereby making a certain copy not a verbatim copy, although there has been a popular meme for years that you can circumvent copyright law if you change a few words.

At the time, I was jumping out of my skin, I was so excited.it incorporates 5-6 subjects into 1 5-6hr block.Without getting into the boring details, the bottom line is what they proposed vaguely resembles what is in play. All the subjects are still being taught, but separately instead of seamlessly together. He has As & Bs in all but 1 subject  - Digital Literacy. The sole reason being that the school expects him to create a public Twitter account, with his real information, in order to promote the program & the results of the program. The results being, if I understand correctly, their personality, family history\/tree, how their life experiences have shaped them into who they are today. These details were NOT part of the initial proposal nor part of anything sent home to me, to my knowledge. On 2 separate occasions, during school functions I attended, his reluctance to do this step has come up. He has stated that he does NOT want to create an account on FB or  Twitter. He's not comfortable with that. No questions asked, I turned back to the teacher & said  - you have your answer. I will not force him to do that. Yesterday, I received a call from the teacher regarding this, after reviewing his progress report which shows him failing that subject. She explained his failing grade was due to his resistance in creating the acct.He tried to compromise with them & created a fake acct using a nickname a teacher had given him in 8th grade. (HE informed me of that, not the teacher). During the call, not knowing he had attempted that already, I suggested that as a compromise. But they won't accept that. Their claim is that it needs to be seen by the public, he needs to create a digital footprint, yadda, yadda. When asked how this would affect his grades in the other, now separate, subjects, she could not give me an answer. This class is ONLY available for a freshman. It will have nothing to do with his next 3yrs of education. Yet his information will forever be out there even if never utilized or deleted after.There's a parallel story to this which has bugged me, but this is the crux of THIS situation. My question is, is this public school allowed to force him to create a digital footprint on an already worldwide controversial platform, POSSIBLY holding his entire freshman year over his head? At the very least, forcing him to retake the one class, which may end the same way?Given the current environment, I'm one pissed off Mama bear. And he's ready to cave to the bullies, something I drilled into both my boys to never do.Thoughts?","answer":"A school district can have a policy requiring students to sign up for computer accounts of some ilk. There is no constitutional right to be free of Twitter. Schools have broad latitude to require students to do things that some parents do not like, in aid of some stated educational goal. Generally, your recourse is political (lobby against the program, vote them out of office, etc). If a reasonable person would find it offensive to reveal the level of personal detail that has to be exposed under this program, you might have a case for a lawsuit, but it is not clear that that is the case here. The problem is that the notion of what a reasonable person would accept or be shocked at is defined in terms of current social custom, and 'sharing' is expected behavior. Most legal attention to social media accounts and individual rights are about resisting requirements to hand over passwords of existing accounts. You might consult with your local ACLU to see if they think there is any hope of resisting this requirement. The best bet is that this could be unconstitutional compelled speech.Another consideration is that, by a possible reading of what they are requiring, they (or their proxy, Twitter) are requiring releasing student records without consent, in violation of FERPA. But that is not an obvious interpretation of what the FERPA restrictions say."}
{"question":"I have an online account with a company that provides no contact information. The company is charging me for services I don't want and is providing no way for me to cancel the services or get in touch with it. I could cancel the credit card that the company has on file but the company also holds property of mine (it is the registrar of my domain name) and I don't want to lose it. I am at the point where I am looking for legal solutions to this problem as I don't see any alternative.Is there any legal requirement in the US for a company to provide customers a means to dispute charges or otherwise contact it? Is there any legal recourse I can take in this situation?","answer":"Can you find their details here: ?There's a link referring to 2009 RAA in the 3rd paragraph of the page. It looks like that's the deal that the Registrar needs to sign up to to be a Registrar in the first place. Not making any suggestions here... their behaviour could be licence threatening."}
{"question":"Many academic journals provide access to old articles via a digital copy of it (normally a pdf). Sometimes this is through a Third Party (like JSTOR, a database). Many of these articles are already in the public domain, as the author died more than 70 years ago (for the case of works published in the US and UK). The format in which the work was published lost copyright too, as the publication is older than 25 years.I know that I could go to my local university, get a copy of one of this old journals, scan it and distribute it, without infringing any copyright.However, if the publisher (directly, or indirectly through a third party) offers a digital copy of the original document, does this count as a new publication? (which means it has 25 years of copyright)Notice that 'digital copy' normally means a high-quality scan, and not a retyping of the original document. Also notice that many times these articles do not come with a 'new' publication date. The date of publication remains that of the original article. Thus, it is not clear to me when the new publication date would be, if this is the case.","answer":"For a direct digital scan, no as there is no creativity involved which is a fundamental requirement to create a copyright work.If there is some (even a very small some) editorial or layout input so that it is not just a copy, yes. However, the copyright only exists in that part of the derivative work that is original - anyone can still copy the original text."}
{"question":"By \"small\" court, I mean a small claims or district court. By \"big\" court, I mean a circuit or federal court. (\"State\" courts would probably be in the middle.)Apparently, the higher courts are more \"formal.\" For instance, circuit and federal courts are usually quite strict about what kinds of information can be entered into evidence. Apparently district and small claims courts tend to give prosecutors and plaintiffs more latitude in what is acceptable as evidence, which hurts defendants.On the show, \"Perry Mason,\" a Los Angeles lawyer sometimes goes to trial in a \"small\" California court outside of LA. When this happens, there are usually complaints from the locals about \"big city lawyers\" and \"big city law.\" When Mason makes objections at trial that would be routinely sustained in LA, they are often overruled \"locally.\"Is there, in fact, a dichotomy has between law practiced is \"small\" and \"big\" courts, and if so, what might be the cause? Is this a reason why cases are often appealed to \"higher\" courts?","answer":"I would point out that in the U.S. the lowest governing body with courts is the State Government (county court houses are just the local branch of the State Court and usually in the county seat aka the town where county level government operates).  Small Claims courts are state level courts for suits that don't exceed a set dollar value in damages (Usually &lt;$5000 not including attorney's fees).  A similar criminal court may be called a Magistrate and is used mostly to argue crimes like traffic tickets and the like.Your Perry Mason example is not an example of small claims courts but rather small town courts and the Urban\/Rural divide in America.  A good number of political issues in the U.S. are brought about by Urban dwelling population not having a good understanding of the needs of rural communities and vice versa and this is historically been a long standing divide in American Politics.  The court is small because it's physically small and the cases it handles are quite mundane, boring, and infrequent compared to a courthouse in L.A. which is larger due to the more numerous cases and more dramatic due to the frequency of unusual events in the case.  Rural courts, especially, do tend to have a large section for the galley as back in the day, (i.e. before TV) watching a trial was sometimes entertaining.As to the objections getting overruled, that's not a small court issue, but a judge issue.  Judges are allowed to rule as they see fit and if they're wrong that argument is had on appeals, not with the trial judge.  There's an old lawyer adage that &quot;Good Lawyers know the Law, Great Lawyers know the Judge&quot; which essentially means knowing how the judge would rule in a certain matter allows you to better develop your planned argument to present to him\/her.  Mason is at a disadvantage here because he argues in Los Angeles, not Podunct, CA, and thus doesn't know this judge as well as the ones in LA.Small claims and Magistrates tend to be less formal because they tend to be quick and the law is well developed... often times both sides don't have lawyers and the money isn't great.  In other examples, such as Judge Judy and similar shows, you're not really watching an American Court room Judge, but an Arbitrator (Judge Judy) ruling on binding arbitration between two parties (i.e. rather than go through the court process, they present their case to an arbitrator who hears the arguments, makes a decision, and if both parties respect it, it's over and can't be appealed... the winning party can however take the matter to an actual court if the loser fails to uphold his\/her end of the arbitration).  Almost every daytime reality court show is actually binding arbitration and on Judy at least, there are a few times where she dismisses the case because IT SHOULD go to a real court.  For what it's worth, Judge Judy is an actual Judge, although when she was on the bench, I believe she dealt with family law."}
{"question":"I witness that I did some things which are considered a rave by most people (and most psychiatrists): fought with aliens, was transformed for a period of time into a superman able to tear steel and calculate like a computer, etc. And yes, now I have a very great mission originating from the heavens on the Earth.Does this have legal implication for my life that I am allowed everything (i.e. everything is legal for me)?I understand that if I commit a dangerous crime I could be put into a psychiatric clinic.If I commit a crime that carries civil penalties but is not dangerous and get caught, will I get punished or will I be able to plead insanity and get let off free?The jurisdiction in topic is Israel (where I live) and also the US (where I registered some entities).","answer":"Your beliefs about your past and your mission would probably be considered to be personal religious beliefs. As Israel does not have a state religion this does not have any legal significance (except it may make a difference as to which religious court is considered to have ).Your religious beliefs do not override the law, because otherwise anyone could make  just by declaring a belief that it was moral.Hence you will be subject to all the same laws as everyone else.If you break the law and claim your beliefs as justification then you may be  by reason of insanity and committed to a mental hospital."}
{"question":"I went to sign up for a new Comcast account online.  They asked me for some basic billing info, but also asked for my DOB and SSN, which I'd rather not give to them out of concern about identity theft.The claim is that they need it to run a credit check (ok, fair enough):But then wait!  There is an alternative - I can pay a $50 deposit instead.  Or so I thought:They still ask for my SSN!  I thought that perhaps it was now an optional field, but as you can see from the validation message:So, it would seem that they are not giving me a choice here.  Is this legal?  Are they allowed to require my SSN just to set up service?","answer":"Comcast, and many other utility companies, will ask you for your SSN and will insist on it giving you many times with  answers. I recommend you ask them if they have an alternative, which they most probably will say no because the person you are speaking with is not used to, and\/or not trained to give alternatives.The reason they ask for your SSN is for doing a credit check on you to make sure you are able to to pay your bills - and n case you don't - to ruin your life by ruining your credit score. From  'Comcast Customer Privacy Notice':  What kind of personally identifiable information and CPNI does Comcast collect?    Comcast collects information from you at several different points when  you request, turn on, and use our services under an account we create  for you.

They do provide an alternative when asked about it. Most probably they will ask some sort of a monetary deposit in order to open the account. This deposit may, or may not, be spread across several billing cycles. The deposit is their financial guarantee in case you fall behind on your payments.

{"question":"As a follow up question from this  a person's name, age, address, parties affiliation are considered public data.I'd like to ask then what is considered personal information?So if there is a website breach of data i.e. on Facebook and the hackers get the information mentioned above, Facebook doesn't need to worry because this data is not considered personal information?Note: Since this is state specific then what most of states agree on what is personal information.","answer":"Federal and state laws do protect a variety of different types of personal information in particular contexts, but there isn't really any information that is necessarily personal and protected from disclosure in all contexts.For instance, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act generally protects a person's health records from unnecessary disclosure, and the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act generally protects a student's educational records from unneccessary disclosure.But that doesn't mean that all of an American's health information is protected, or that all of the information that a hospital holds about an American is protected. The hospital can typically disclose the fact that it is treating a specific person, and if that person provides his health records to a government employer, that employer may be required to produce them in response to a request under the Ohio Public Records Act.But Facebook isn't a health-care provider, so it isn't required to protect medical records, and it isn't a school, so it isn't required to protect educational records. At the federal level, I don't know of any privacy laws that require it to maintain the privacy of its users' information, though it may be required to do so under state laws, or as a contractual matter because of its privacy policy.But that doesn't mean it has nothing to worry about. Like any business in the United States, it is prohibited from engaging in deceptive trade practices, so it can't make broad promises to protect users' privacy when it has no intention of honoring them. That's why it ended up paying $5 billion for privacy violations in the past and remains under court orders requiring it to better protect users' data.Further, Facebook has users all over the world, so it is required to comply with the international privacy regulations like GDPR that can be far more stringent."}
{"question":"Is a person who is a non health care practitioner (NHCP) allowed to write and distribute software for use by NHCPs? If so, will the liability be any different than that of any other software?Let's take a simple example: say a software company wants to write an app for checking one's eyesight. A user will answer questions based on pictures shown on the screen and distance from screen etc., and will self determine their eyesight health. The software will contain a short warning that the installing user will have to confirm to have read, that it was written by a NHCP.Would this be legal?Could a user successfully sue the software company after amisdiagnosis by the software's fault? Assuming the fault isunintentional, of course.EDITPerhaps I wasn't clear. I just wrote The software will contain a short warning that ... it was written by a NHCP. What I meant was more than that, that this software is not sold as an official 'medical instrument' and should be treated as such. Much like alternative medicines are sold expressly for the treatment of certain ailments, but presumably do not fall under the medical category as long as they are clearly labeled as non-medicines. Would labeling the software as such relieve such software from the burden of being approved in advance by the FDA (as seems to be the case according to an answer below)?","answer":"You can write anything you want (basic First Amendment protections): the question is whether one would be liable for damage that arises from what you're written, or whether you can distribute what you've written. Distribution may be restricted, thanks to the Commerce Clause (hence FDA regulations, which figure prominently in the analysis).Most software writers are not medical practitioners, and vice versa, and what the software writer does is implement something described by a competent medical practitioner. It is logically possible that a med. practitioner might also try to write software (no problem) and distribute it (possibly a problem); or, a software writer might read up on something on Wikipedia and try to implement it (again, no problem) or distribute it (possible problem).Damages can be sorted into two categories, implementation errors and scientific errors, and having ruled out deliberate sabotage, we are left with negligence. If the software writer failed to use suitable care in writing code that sums a set of numbers, the software writer has been negligent. If the person purporting to have the qualified scientific knowledge mis-states the formula, that person has been negligent. It is possible for many parties to be negligent (the programmer failed to be diligent in understanding the software requirements; the medical professional failed to adequately explain what was required of the program).The FDA does regulate medical devices, and 'device' is construed pretty broadly ( which makes it clear that the device manufacturer shoulders the regulatory burden. Anytime you manufacture a tangible thing (which is within the scope of FDA regulation for medical devices), you have to have the thing approved. Many (most?) medical devices implement software, and are thus within the scope of FDA scrutiny. It is not illegal to write software that ends up being implemented in an unapproved medical device, but the unapproved medical device itself is illegal.It is reasonably likely that purported medical software (not a gadget with software build in) would be held to be a non-exempt device. To know if something is exempt, you would look at the . There is no way to specifically look for things that are only software, or that contain software, so the search through the list would have to be guided by knowledge of the subject area. that attempts to say something about the matter which warns you that you are on your own and 'You will need to go back to study and use the source regulatory documents' to make the determination. Eventually, slide 13, they hint that if you intend the software to be used in diagnosis, prevention, or treatment, then it is a device (so, yes, the aforementioned software would be a device, and probably not exempt from regulations). General purpose software (word processors, web browsers, communications software, etc.) are not indented to be used for a regulated purpose, although they can be so used, and thus they are probably not subject to FDA regulation.There is a murky relationship between regulatory approval and liability. Being approved by the government does not convey immunity to negligence suits (see ), but being approved can have weight in determining whether a party was negligent, since regulatory scrutiny ostensibly filters out errors that could have been caught. Federal approval does not preempt state tort law, as the court ruled.Regulations pertaining to medical devices hold for anything that qualifies as a device, and is not defined (negatively) in terms of disclaimers. If you sell a medical device but label it saying 'this is not a medical device, it is not created by a competent medical practitioner', that doesn't make it not a medical device. Unfortunately, what counts as a regulated device is based on intended use, and there is an obvious connection between disclaimers and intentions. Taking MS Word as an example, MS does not as far as I know say that 'Word is not intended to be used as a medical device'. It can certainly be used to diagnose, teat, and prevent medical conditions, but so too can a screw driver or pretty much anything else. The number of non-medical uses vastly outweigh the medical uses, so it would be deemed not to be a regulated device. A program which prescribed a set of prayers to be uttered in case of illness would be subject to First Amendment override of any FDA regulations. Quack medical devices are prohibited (that's why there is regulation of devices in the first place), but discerning the fine line between permitted actions based on nutty beliefs and forbidden actions is not easy. The FDA also has guidance on the distinction between '', which does not clearly state that, for example, a software reading of your cakra-energies based on a computer program's questions is not a medical device. They do say of mind-body medicine (mentioning yoga, biofeedback and tai chi as examples) that 'CAM practices in this domain would not be subject to our jurisdiction under the Act or the PHS Act', but then say 'any equipment or other products used as part ofthe practice of mind-body medicine may be subject to FDA regulation, depending on the nature of the product and its intended use' (hence a yoga-enabling program may be subject to regulation)."}
{"question":"I understand, probably for many of you, lawyers, the article you've read is ultimately crazy, but I just thought: if everyone is equal before the court, can prosecutor use the services of a lawyer (advocate)?I think, I can name something wrong in English, also the Law of US, or other english-speaking countries, can be different from my country.By prosecutor I mean official person from the state who presents the accusing side in court. For each region of country, there is a prosecutor. In Ukraine or Russia it called like The state accuser (but translator translates it exactly as a prosecutor). It is very uncommon, but as alternative, the victim (if it alive, of course) can go to court by itself, and it will be called a Private accuser.Also I do not understand, do you understand the difference between the lawyer (\u044e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442) and advocate\/attorney (\u0430\u0434\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442). In my country, one becomes a lawyer after finishing the University. After, you can pass special exam based on your lawyer grade to become an advocate\/a judge (more complicated process)\/a notary. If you do not want to pass this exams you stay just a lawyer, and You can go work to Police, for example, or to prosecutor office. Advocate (Attorney) is the person, who defends the side in the court.By the law, everyone have the right to the advocate(lawyer, Google translates it as a lawyer, I confused ).Theoretically, can the Prosecutor have an advocate?","answer":"The prosecutor always has an advocateThe prosecutor in a criminal matter is the State. Since the State is an artificial entity it has to act through agent(s) who advocate for it.In Commonwealth countries the State is synonymous with the Crown - I suppose HRH Queen Elizabeth II could prosecute every case personally but she's a very old lady with a lot of other things to do (this is a joke - the person is not the office)."}
{"question":"My fiancee is an artist, and regularly creates digital art work, mainly digital drawings and the occasional print of that artwork.  There is a certain level of implicit 'copyright' of the artwork, as I understand it, as her intellectual property.However, individuals occasionally commission her, which goes a little outside my understanding of these implicit IP rights in the circumstances.  I also occasionally commission artists to create artwork, of which the subject matter, situation depicted, and in most cases the characters depicted are my intellectual property (or, at times, the joint intellectual property of me and my fiancee).This is essentially the question at hand:  Under United States law, where we reside, what are the legal rights and protections granted to an artist for their artwork which they create, and are those rights and legal protections lessened when they are commissioned by another individual, depicting characters, individuals, or situations which are the intellectual property of the one who made the commission?","answer":"Under United States law, copyright is normally held by the creator of a work.There is one major exception to this rule: the 'work for hire.' If something is considered a 'work for hire' under the copyright statutes, the copyright is held by the employer. Whether something qualifies as a work for hire is a complex analysis:  is a Copyright Office circular covering some of the basics. To be clear, I'm not giving an opinion (and I don't have enough information to give an opinion) on whether any specific works you or your fiance may create or commission qualify as 'works for hire.' It's a narrower test than you probably think it is.If the work is not a work for hire, the copyright holder owns the copyright, and anyone else can use it only with a license from the copyright holder. A license can be implied by the parties' behavior and communications--but it shouldn't be.If you're in a situation where you need to know, for example:That you are allowed to use the artwork forever, and the artist can't ask you to stop later;That you are allowed to change the artwork if you need to, even a simple change like cropping or adding a filter or text; orThat, if your product is successful, the artist won't be able to sell another license to someone else to compete with you;then you need a written contract spelling out who owns the copyright and what the rights of the other party are. A lawyer can draw up a simple, re-usable form contract for you cheaply that will prevent the problems you're worried about.Remember: even if this is a work-for-hire situation, if you need to prove that down the road, it may require a trial, or at least preliminary motion practice, to do so. That's a lot more expensive than getting your ducks in a row now will be.tl;dr: Get a lawyer. If you're in a major city, there may be a local arts law organization that will provide you with free help for a simple job like this one. (Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts operate in several East Coast cities, and I know many top commercial lawyers who do pro bono for them)."}

{"question":"There are no legal cases regarding infringement on images of people cosplaying characters as far as I know. Is this an copyright infringement if the image is used commercially?","answer":"The Batman costume design is protected by copyright. There is the potential for infringement to be found in the US since clothing can be more than just a &quot;useful article&quot; (). Let us suppose that artistic design element of a particular costume is licensed, then it is legal to produce the costume. US copyright law, per the first sale doctrine, would let you wear the items which contains a protected element. It does not matter if you as costume-wearer wear it in public, for free or for money (it can matter to the costume-maker who does not have a license).In Japan,  that copyright law will be or has been modified to extend copyright protection to the commercial wearing of costumes, so jurisdiction may matter.

{"question":"I recently found out that my parents are broke. They have nothing saved, no stock, bonds, etc, and the house they have lived in for 30 years still has a heavy mortgage. My father does have a 10k life insurance policy.My father has put the house in a trust to my brother. His logic is that if my mother has to go into a nursing home after his death then the state (New York) cannot take the house.Both my mother (68) and father (72) have lived there for 30 years, and the house is worth no more than 400kQuestion 1. In the trust that goes solely to my brother, in the event either my mother or father are dead, how is that asset split up? Can a trust dictate how an asset if split up if I am not on the trust.Question 2. How is the debt handled? The asset still has debt on it, who is responsible for the debt? I am thinking the answer to this question depends on the answer the Question 1.Question 3. They currently live in New York state, I found an article that New York state for nursing home care at more that 12k per year.  If they were to move to a cheaper state like Alabama what are the laws or rules, ie. how long they have lived there, assets.","answer":"Question 1. In the trust that goes solely to my brother, in the eventeither my mother or father are dead, how is that asset split up? Can atrust dictate how an asset if split up if I am not on the trust.This is governed by the terms of the trust. The trust can say whatever the people who wrote it wanted.Question 2. How is the debt handled? The asset still has debt on it,who is responsible for the debt? I am thinking the answer to thisquestion depends on the answer the Question 1.The trust owns the property subject to the mortgage. The people who originally signed the mortgage (presumably both of your parents) are also personally liable to pay the mortgage in the event that the debt is not fully satisfied in a foreclosure sale, or in the event that the mortgage creditor prefers to sue the mortgage debtors individually in the event of a default. After the death of the mortgage debtors, the mortgage company can file claims in their probate estates for repayment of the mortgage related debt if it does so in a timely fashion, although it would be more common to simply foreclose on the real property and obtain repayment of the debt that way.The death of the mortgage debtors is almost always an event of default under a mortgage, so if both mortgage debtors die, the mortgage creditor can usually force the trust to repay the debt, either by selling the house or by refinancing it.Question 3. They currently live in New York state, I found an articlethat New York state for nursing home care at more that 12k per year.If they were to move to a cheaper state like Alabama what are the lawsor rules, ie. how long they have lived there, assets.This question verges on incoherent. But I think I understand what you are trying to ask.In every U.S. state, the joint federal-state program known at the federal level as Medicaid, although it has different names at the state level (California, for example, calls it &quot;Medi-Cal&quot;), will pay for nursing home care at approved nursing home facilities if the applicants meet state eligibility requirements. This generally involves an income test, an asset test, and a determination that the applicants have not made disqualifying gifts to trusts or to third-parties within the past five years.The income test is based upon state median or average income and is usually lower in a state like Alabama that has a lower median state income, than it is in New York, that has a higher median state income. For retirees, the main kinds of income considered are defined benefit pension plans payments, annuity payments, and investment income.The exact details of the asset test vary somewhat from state to state. Generally speaking, New York State is among the most strict in this regard.The basic outlines of the disqualification for gifts made within five years to others including trusts before applying for nursing home care are similar in broad outline, but the consequences for violating the rules are a function of the average cost of nursing home care in a state, which varies considerably. Generally, a gift of a fixed dollar amount gives rise to more months of disqualification of Medicaid in a state where the costs of nursing home care is low than it does where the costs of nursing home care are high, because the amount of the gift made in the past five years is divided by the average cost of nursing home care at the time the application is made, to determine the number of months that the applicants are disqualified from Medicaid.More generally, setting up trusts intended to qualify you for Medicaid is a highly technical matter with severe consequences if it is done incorrectly, and I would hope that your parents did so while conferring with a competent elder law lawyer. If they did it themselves, there is a high chance that this will have very severe negative consequences."}

{"question":"The legal information institute has a definition of constitutional tort that says:A constitutional tort is a violation of one's constitutional rights by a government employee. The alleged constitutional violation creates a cause of action that is distinct from any otherwise available state tort remedy. Constitutional tort is a predominantly academic term originating in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision in Monroe v. Pape (1961), which held that 42 U.S.C.?1983 provides a separate federal remedy for individuals suing state or municipal government officers who have violated their constitutional rights. The term is also used in the context of Bivens actions, which are lawsuits under federal common law for constitutional violations committed by federal government employees. As with common law torts, the usual remedy for constitutional torts is monetary damages.https:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/wex\/constitutional_tortWhile I think the definition is comparing?1983 with Bivens actions.  Are there specific laws regarding Bivens? It's not clear to me why there is such a distinction. I have followed the obvious links.  Can anyone supply further reading regarding the range of torts that might fall under Bivens?I gather assault by the FBI would fall under Bivens.   But my research would be for other non-violent torts.Does Bivens require that racial discrimination be alleged?   Would doing so (without having specific proof when filing) be an advantage?  I am assuming a relevant racial difference exists to support an allegation.","answer":"Partial answerWikipedia's article on  says:The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Brennan, laid down a rule that it will infer a private right of action for monetary damages where no other federal remedy is provided for the vindication of a constitutional right, based on the principle that for every wrong, there is a remedy.My interpretation of this is that?1983 for some reason did not provide a remedy for Bivens' complaint.Oddly enough, Wikipedia's page on 42 U.S.C.?1983 is currently titled .   I'm not qualified to opine on how that relates to your question regarding race, but it seems relevant."}
{"question":"I'm reading a textbook on Ancient Greek that has readings at the end of each chapter. After I finish the reading, I would like to publish my translation to my blog, and above my translation reproduce the original reading. These readings aren't from classical authors, but were most likely written up by the author of the textbook, to provide simple readings for beginning students.However, I'm not sure if it's legal to reproduce the Greek readings written by the textbook author. Would it be enough for me to cite the textbook within each blog post? Or am I required to actually write the author and receive permission? Relevant DetailsI live in the US and the book was printed in the US, and is still in print. It was copyrighted in 2000. I'm simply reproducing the textual content by laboriously typing up the Greek using the Polytonic Greek keyboard on Mac OS X. No pictures or scans. The blog is a personal blog, devoted to my interests. Two of these main interests are Greek and Latin. I would say the blog has two purposes. First, it's an educational tool which helps me track my progress and access my materials. Second, it allows me to share my enthusiasm with others.","answer":"If the Ancient Greek text was composed by an ancient Greek, copyright protection has long since run out. If the text is written by the textbook author and the textbook is still in copyright, then it is protected, and it would be infringement to post either the original text or a translation.  states that the copyright owner has the sole right to authorize derivative works such as translations. Hyper-technically, you kinda violate the law when you do homework, which is an absurdity that just struck me. No language textbook author bothers to grant permission for students to do translation exercises. A reasonable person would assume that permission to translate is implicit in the fact of publishing a language textbook. Copyright is not about 'attribution', it is about the property rights of authors: permission is required from the author.If you opt to go ahead and get sued, one approach to defending yourself against a suit would be to plead , so read that analysis. Applied to your case, a fair use analysis is IMO highly unlikely to succeed. In freely distributing the original texts, you would be undercutting a major portion of the market value of the textbook. In addition, in distributing translations (free answers), you would be seriously undermining the pedagogical utility of the exercises. Copying a short passage like ?\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9 ?\u03bd\u03b1 \u039a\u03c5?\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4?\u03c5?? (blatantly lifted from Chase &amp; Phillips) for ullustrative purposes would not be substantial copying, but an entire text would be probably found to be too much. The fact that you're planning on distributing the material for free (in a blog) would not help much, though selling the material would make it even worse. The only thing that you could do that would probably pass legal muster is not distribute the text or translation to anyone, i.e. make it purely a matter of personal use."}

{"question":"I worked in Colorado, USA for a startup.On a Monday morning we were informed that our investor decided not to continue investing in our company and so our payroll from that last Friday was paid for\/fronted by the HR company. After a tumultuous week, we were informed on Friday that our company was closing and that we would not be paid the final paycheck owed us. In some follow up discussions, I learned that our investor's investments were 'debt investments' and were 'secured debt'. I was told this means that in the bankruptcy his investments will be paid before being paid that final paycheck or for unpaid PTO. Given the size of this secured debt (over 20 million USD), it seems unlikely we will receive any payment for those. As far as I know the company has not yet filed for bankruptcy but has rather ceased operations. It sounds like some bills are being paid with new money from the investor.When does a CEO (or the investor or the board) have to notify employees they will be unable to pay them for work already done?Does an investor have a responsibility to ensure all employees are paid?Do the employees have any recourse?Is 'secured debt' real? And does that reduce the likelihood of receiving a paycheck in a bankruptcy settlement?Does any of this change if the company doesn't file for bankruptcy?","answer":"  When does a CEO (or the investor or the board) have to notify employees they will be unable to pay them for work already done?Directors and officers (which includes executive officers like the CEO) but not investors have a duty to ensure that the corporation does not trade while insolvent. In this context, 'trading' means incurring new debts and 'insolvent' means being unable to pay their debts as and when they fall due.Unfortunately, it is a judgment call by those directors and officers and the exact point where it occurred is generally only clear with hindsight, if then. For example, you describe a 'tumultuous week'; quite likely the company was urgently seeking additional sources of funds and until it was clear they had no prospect of getting those, they weren't insolvent. The director's duty is to act reasonably (a broad range of activities) and not be overly pessimistic nor optimistic about the company's prospects.As far as I know, they don't have a positive duty to inform their creditors that they can't pay. If that happens their obligation is to file for bankruptcy and their obligations cease - the bankruptcy trustee then invites creditors to prove their debts.  Does an investor have a responsibility to ensure all employees are paid?No. That is pretty much the purpose of limited liability corporations: to shield the investor from the debts of the company.  Do the employees have any recourse?. Employees are typically priority creditors in Colorado and rank ahead of many other creditors. However, if the company is not based in Colorado different laws will apply.Of course, you must be an employee of the company - this priority doesn't apply to true independent contractors.Also, the liquidator's fees rank ahead of anyone and unless the bankrupt company has adequate realizable assets, even employees are unlikely to get a dividend.You also need to be clear who you work for as you say 'that last Friday was paid for\/fronted by the HR company'. Do you work for the bankrupt company or this (non-bankrupt) HR company? If the latter then they owe you your wages and the bankruptcy of their principal is their problem, not yours.  Is 'secured debt' real? And does that reduce the likelihood of receiving a paycheck in a bankruptcy settlement?Yes.There is a priority in the payment of creditors in liquidations and it varies by jurisdiction but a typical arrangement might go like:Liquidator's FeesEmployee wages and entitlement accrued within the last 6 monthsCertain taxesSecured creditors (who may have a ranking among themselves)Unsecured creditors (including employee entitlements more than 12 months old, other taxes, trade creditors etc.)Shareholders (who may have a ranking among themselves)Basically, the lower you rank, the less likely you are to see a dividend.  Does any of this change if the company doesn't file for bankruptcy?Sure. Until the company does this it is still a going concern and it has to pay its debts. If it doesn't it's creditors can sue and recover their monies as best they can which may include forcing the company into bankruptcy."}
{"question":"When serving a tenant with a Colorado Notice To Quit, must the Certificate Of Service of the Notice be notarized, either before or after serving the tenant?","answer":"The notice to quit doesn't have to be notarized, and a certificate of service by mail is typically not notarized, but, proof of service by personal delivery usually is notarized.The issue is how to prove that the notice to quit was delivered later on. If the return of service is notarized and filed with the court it can enter judgment (either a default judgment or a judgment on the merits) without separate testimony from the process server in most cases. If it isn't notarized, someone with personal knowledge of whether or not the notice was really delivered will have to testify to establish this fact, and establish that the document tendered is authentic with some kind of testimony. To avoid this inconvenience, the better practice, although not strictly speaking required, is to notarize the certificate of service involving a notion to quit in an eviction action between a landlord and a tenant."}

His case will be dismissed with prejudice for the statute of Limitations in the first instance, the appeals court will deny to review a case that is multiple decades past its statute of limitations and the Supreme court will deny to hear the case also.As the case can't reach the supreme court, there is no reason for the judge to recuse themselves.However, two much more likely setups are the following, and repeatedly have happened:Judge Abel hears Bob's case in his time at the Court of Appeals and is elevated to SCOTUS.

{"question":"Suppose I incorporate in Delaware, with an agent that has a physical address there to represent the company in Delaware, and I live in California building an online service from home.First do I need to register as a foreign company in California just because I live there?If people from anywhere in the US pay for the online service, do I need to register as foreign corporation in every state where my users are located?","answer":"An entity is usually required to have a foreign corporation registration in as state when it &quot;does business&quot; in the state, although ultimately, this is mostly a matter of state law.The place where the work is done by its officers, employees, and agents would be one place where the company &quot;does business&quot;, in this case California. California is the state which is the single most likely to aggressively enforce that requirement because it ties into its Franchise Tax Board tax collection agency's functions.Usually, it would be optional to register in a state where one sends goods or data via third-party instrumentalities of interstate commerce (e.g. telephones, the Internet, U.S. mail, FedEx), without having an office or employee or agent for the conduct of business there (following the now overruled standard of International Shoe related to general jurisdiction over corporations or other non-residents of a state and the now overruled Quill case regarding sales taxing jurisdiction). This is probably still good law in most cases, although the inquiry would be fact specific and would also depend upon the requirements of state law.The nature of the services provided over the Internet would also matter.For example, if you provided advice on Iowa law as a lawyer, from an office in California, to Iowa clients with no connection to California, you would probably be &quot;doing business&quot; in Iowa.

{"question":"I found the following statement about work-place harassment from another stackexchange:If this is the US, in order to qualify as harassment legally, the behavior in question also has to be based on a protected characteristic (i.e. sex, race, age, etc). Calling a staff member \"selfish\" because they are Jewish = harassment; calling a staff member \"selfish\" because you don't like their shoes = not harassment.Is it true? Where I can find a complete list that includes all the possible words?","answer":"Is it true?No, that is inaccurate. References to protected categories are not a requisite element of harassment.Typically harassment is defined as a pattern of conduct (thus encompassing two or more acts) consisting of unconsented contact that would cause a reasonable person to be frightened, annoyed, distressed, molested, and\/or experience other unpleasant emotions. See, for instance, the definition of harassment in Michigan legislation, .The notion of harassment can --but does not necessarily-- involve targeting or attacking of one or multiple protected categories in which the victim belongs. For instance, sexual harassment is understood as harassment with purposes of mocking the victim's sexual orientation, or procuring sexual gratification from\/with that person. The adjective &quot;sexual&quot; merely qualifies the context of the troubling pattern of conduct, but that term in and of itself is not what imports the character of harassment.The examples in the paragraph you quote are inaccurate and\/or inconclusive because they would highly depend on the context. The adjective &quot;selfish&quot; is not sufficiently related to Judaism, whence it would be unreasonable for a Jew to allege religious harassment merely because somebody called him &quot;selfish&quot;. Instead, a finding of religious harassment would involve repulsive allusions to themes or elements to which Jews would be sensitive based on historical grounds (such as nazism, and antisemitism), doctrinary grounds (jokes about pigs), and so forth.Where I can find a complete list that includes all the possible words?For the reasons explained above, there is no such list. Words would have to be assessed in light of the context in which the course of conduct takes place.Furthermore, not all harassment involves words. Harassment, regardless of its type, can be in the form of drawings, gestures, physical contact (such as sexually molesting a person), voiceless phone calls, and following a person, to name just a few methods."}
{"question":"By my reading of the compulsory copyright licensing rules, if I want to record a cover of a song and sell one copy of it, I would need to obtain a license, but if I send in a proper notice along with a payment of $0.10, the copyright holders would be required to grant me that license.  Many publishers license their works through the Harry Fox Agency, whose web site claims that a license must be obtained to make and distribute covers of a work in any quantity.On the other hand, that web site will not license less than 25 copies, and once service fees are added in would charge over $16 for that.Although I can understand that the paperwork necessary to handle a license would cost a publisher a lot more than $0.10, and that a company might reasonably request that performers not submit licensing-intent notices until the payment would reach a certain amount, and otherwise simply keep track of the copies they produce and include royalties for those copies in any payment they make once that threshold is reached, I am aware of nothing in the law that would entitle HFA to simultaneously demand that people acquire licenses even when distributing less than 25 copies, but then insist that someone making ten copies pay an amount more than 20 times larger than the $0.91 royalty specified by that law.Is there any legal basis for HFA's demands?  If not, what would one need to do to legally obtain e.g. a license to produce ten copies of a work without having to pay HFA anything beyond what they would be legally entitled to receive?  I understand that it's perfectly legal for web sites to charge a 'convenience fee' for submitting credit-card payments on line rather than by mailing a check or money order, but find reprehensible the idea that a company should demand $16 for something whose price would be legally set at under a dollar.","answer":"When something is subject to a compulsory licensing requirement, as covers of songs are under U.S. copyright law, then you have to options to use it legally:Negotiate a deal with the copyright holder.Pay the administratively determined compulsory license amount. I believe that the compulsory license amount administratively determined can include a minimum price of a license or an administrative fee.As a practical matter, it isn't feasible to litigate individually over $16 v. 10 cents, and the penalty for an infringement damages award, if they sued, to you, would be immense, if you just used it without a license, and they then sued you. They are unlikely to sue you, but it would be a catastrophe for you if they did."}
{"question":"By Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the US Constitution, the power to declare war is with the Congress.Today (03\/20\/17), during a committee hearing, Ms. Speier, accused Russia (I assume she meant the Russian Federation) of having committed an act of war against The United States.  If she introduces a resolution to declare war on the Russian Federation and convinces enough of her Republican colleagues to join her in voting for this resolution, and (because he has too many 'Russian ties') President Trump refuses to execute the war, does that become an act of treason on his part?  Is he required to act on such a resolution?  If he doesn't, is there any recourse other than impeachment to force US armed forces to attack RF interests at home and abroad?  POTUS is the commander-in-chief, but, at the same time, he is not allowed to unilaterally decide who may or may not cross the border into the United States.  These decisions are, clearly, subject to review by federal judges, as was demonstrated with both of his 'travel bans' (which would be more appropriately called 'travel restrictions').  Do the judges also have a power to compel armed forces to take actions which a sitting President is refusing to take?  Are there any other implications of Congress declaring war which a POTUS does not choose to execute?  I know none of this happened before, but we are in unprecedented territory here, so I am curious to know what kind of warning signs should I watch for when a member of Congress declares that RF has attacked us directly and makes this declaration in her official capacity (not politicking it, but while sitting in her committee chair on Capitol Hill in an open hearing).EDIT: Point 1:As an example of why stating that RF committed acts of war against the United States is significant, here's how the declaration of war against the Empire of Japan was phrased:'Whereas the Imperial Government of Japan has committed unprovoked  acts of war against the Government and the people of the United states  of America:'Therefore be it'Resolved, etc., That the state of war between the United states and  the Imperial Government of Japan which has thus been thrust upon the  United States is hereby formally declared; and the President is hereby  authorized and directed to employ the entire naval and military forces  of the United States and the resources of the Government to carry on  war against the Imperial Government of Japan; and to bring the  conflict to a successful termination, all of the resources of the  country are hereby pledged by the Congress of the United states.'While no such resolution was introduced (so far on 3\/23\/2017), the justification for war declaration has been cited.  It has been cited almost word-for-word as it was previously cited, in at least one, previous resolution making a declaration of war.Point 2:This is NOT a question about immigration.  I have no interest in any opinions or competing legal theories on whether crossing borders, which are protected and enforced, is considered 'unauthorized immigration' or a limited-in-form 'invasion'.  I am going with the opinion that it is universally considered to be a form of invasion if a border is enforced and actively protected.  If you wish to challenge such an opinion, please, do so in response to other questions, questions you raise yourself, or in any other forum.  I am interested solely in legal views as to what is the answer to my question based on the assumption that all the premises of my question are correct.  If you wish to challenge the premises of my question, you will not be answering it to my satisfaction.EDIT 2:Since people are clearly not able to separate the issue of border defense from some cases of 'immigration', let's open it up to the scope in which so many seem to want to view it.As a hypothetical, what happens if Congress declares war, POTUS refuses to fight it, but private parties begin to engage agents and armies of the adversary state in private hostile actions?  Would POTUS have limited authority to stop them?  Would his authority to stop them be more limited than it would be had the war not been declared?  Would his attempts to thwart private parties, attempting to execute war actions against a nation with whom we would then be at war, be against policy and would be subject to the same type of criminal prosecution as when no state of war exists?  The reason I think this example pertinent is because judicial constraint on war powers is tantamount to judges' ability to order inaction when the executive deems an action necessary.  But any ability to order inaction can be easily turned into an ability to allow an action through administrative rebranding of paramilitary groups as 'private' or even 'law-enforcement' rather than military.  So the actual legal theory which brands certain federal defensive forces as 'civilian' may serve the purpose of putting those forces within their own silo of decision-making, making any Presidential attempts to constrain them subject to judicial review.  And, in a time of POTUS flatly refusing to prosecute a war declared by Congress, a judiciary would be able to provide (through constraint of executive powers) the power to prosecute such war to the 'civilian' defensive forces.This isn't purely hypothetical, either.  This is essentially how it came to be that Lincoln put some of the Supreme Court justices under house arrest.  They were interfering with the prosecution of the Civil War.Any law is only as good as its enforcement mechanism.  What enforcement mechanisms exist to prevent judges from enabling separate decision-making silos within the 'civilian' defensive forces of the federal government which do not answer to the President because of judicial restraint and which can legally prosecute a war based on Congress' expressed declaration of war?","answer":"  If President Trump refuses to execute the war, does that become an act of treason on his part?Probably not, but it depends on the definition of treason.  Congress could decide that it is, impeach him, and remove him from office.  They could also remove him from office without using the term treason.  Is he required to act on such a resolution?Not really.  As chief executive, he has discretion to prioritize the tasks assigned to him by congress.  Furthermore, there is plenty of precedent in international affairs for countries being legally in a state of war without any actual combat or other hostilities.  If he doesn't, is there any recourse other than impeachment to force US armed forces to attack RF interests at home and abroad?There's always political pressure.  But there's no way to relieve the president of his command of the armed forces without relieving him of his office.  Aside from impeachment by the congress, this can be temporarily achieved by the cabinet, as specified in the 25th amendment.  POTUS is the commander-in-chief, but, at the same time, he is not allowed to unilaterally decide who may or may not cross the border into the United States.The president's ability to make immigration policy and the fact that such policy is subject to judicial review are unrelated to his powers as commander in chief.  Immigration is a civil and criminal matter, not a military one.  The president's powers in this regard are delegated to him by congress, not specified in the constitution.  On the other hand, the president's role as commander in chief of the military is explicit in the constitution.  Do the judges also have a power to compel armed forces to take actions which a sitting President is refusing to take?The judiciary does not have the power to order military operations."}

It appears there are various different avenues by which they may gain temporary or permanent residence and work permits.The most expedient and likely options, relatively speaking, appear to be an H1-B visa or a Diversity Visa.The H1-B visa requires an employer sponsor, and the application period is a short window of a few days in April of each year. The Diversity Visa has an application window of a few weeks from October-November, with awards being announced in May of the following year.I would like to know if it is possible for my friend to pursue both options simultaneously, or will application for a Diversity Visa (which is an immigration visa) render them ineligible for the H1-B (a non-immigrant visa) due to demonstration of intent to immigrate?Also, can they visit the US during the holidays under the Visa Waiver Program if there is a pending Diversity Visa application? Or, again, does the DV application show intent to immigrate and therefore render them ineligible for the VWP or other temporary travel visas?","answer":"My concern remains though, that entering the lottery demonstrates an intent to immigrate. And so, I'm not sure how that may or may not affect my friend's eligibility for non-immigrant visas that do not allow dual-intent, or the VWP, meanwhile.Yes, the lottery application implies an intent to immigrate, but every nonimmigrant must overcome a statutory presumption that such an intent exists.  The lottery application may make it harder for someone to overcome that presumption, but it is possible to do so by showing that one does not intend to immigrate in connection with the present visit.It is certainly possible to get a visitor (B) visa with a pending immigrant petition.  Here's what the Foreign Affairs Manual has to say about it, at ; see especially paragraph (e):9 FAM 401.1-3(F)(2) ?Residence Abroad Defined(CT:VISA-225;?? 10-20-2016)a. The term residence is defined in INA 101(a)(33) as the place of general abode; the place of general abode of a person means his principal, actual dwelling place in fact, without regard to intent.? This does not mean that an alien must maintain an independent household in order to qualify as an alien who has a residence in a foreign country and has no intention of abandoning.? If the alien customarily resides in the household of another, that household is the residence in fact.? NOTE:? Only the following visa categories are subject to residence abroad requirements:? B, F, H (except H1), J, M, O2, P, and Q.? When adjudicating this requirement, it is essential to view the requirement within the nature of the visa classification.? Discussion of the requirement in the relevant sections will provide guidance.?b. The applicant must demonstrate permanent employment, meaningful business or financial connections, close family ties, or social or cultural associations, which will indicate a strong inducement to return to the country of origin.c.? The residence in a foreign country need not be the alien's former residence.? For example, an alien who has been living in Germany may meet the residence abroad requirement by showing a clear intention to establish a residence in Canada after a temporary visit in the United States.d. Suspicion that an alien, after admission, may be swayed to remain in the United States because of more favorable living conditions is not a sufficient ground to refuse a visa as long as the alien's current intent is to return to a foreign residence.e. You may properly issue visitor visas to aliens with immigrant visa (IV) applications pending with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).? You must be satisfied that the alien's intent in seeking entry into the United States is to engage in activities consistent with B1\/B2 classification for a temporary period and that the alien has a residence abroad which he or she does not intend to abandon.? While immigrant visa registration is reflective of an intent to immigrate, it may not be proper for you to refuse issuance of a visa under INA 214(b) solely on the basis of such registration, unless you have reason to believe the applicant's true intent is to remain in the United States until such a time as an immigrant visa (IV) becomes available.The same principles will apply to entry under the VWP, although it is more difficult to find authoritative references online.  Logically, entering the DV lottery has a weaker bearing on immigrant intent than filing an I-130 petition, so someone who has entered the lottery should be at least as able to visit the US as someone who is awaiting approval of an I-130.Whether the traveler is using the VWP or a visa, it will also be necessary to convince the immigration officer at the border that there is no immigrant intent, so attempting to enter as a visitor will always be riskier with a pending application for immigration, but plenty of people have done it."}
{"question":"The arrest occurred in Florida.My girlfriend and I have had a very toxic relationship over the last year and a half, which culminated in a big, physical fight where we were both injured but I definitely inflicted more damage (being male and bigger than her). When the fight escalated to its peak, I called the police. I then did not hesitate to show them my injuries (which were scratches and thus immediately visible--hers were bruises that did not show up till later), but she refused to cooperate with the police and even lied to them that she started the whole fight by dumping hot tea on me. She did, in fact, dump warm tea on me, but that was not what started the fight. She defended me and then the police decided to arrest her, at which moment I realized I fucked up and repeatedly asked the police to forget about it and stop the arrest, to no avail.She got charged with misdemeanor battery which then got dropped by the state attorney about a month later because it would've been a bogus prosecution. The fact remains that my record is spotless despite inflicting much more damage on her and she is facing all the stress of the legal system and every lawyer I speak to says using her one-time expungement card is the only way to remove the arrest from her record. Better yet, she is studying to become a teacher and I've been told that even with expungement she will need to disclose to all potential employers that she was arrested and why. Is there any legal recourse to get her record cleared as if she never got arrested, potentially at my expense? There's not a doubt in my mind that she got the short end of the stick both from me and this flawed justice system.She is from Virginia and probably will not be teaching in Florida: do state boundaries affect the interaction between arrest disclosure and public records, with or without expungement?","answer":"There isn't a &quot;one time&quot; expungement rule in Virginia.Under , a person whose charges have been nolled can file a petition for expungement. The statute does not limit this option to people who have never used it before.There is a separate provision for expunging convictions, but even that section permit up to two sealings."}
{"question":"I have a question regarding tenancy laws in the UK.I took over the tenancy for the place that my dad was living in as I needed somewhere to go in an emergency. I didn't have a deposit so my dad told the landlord to keep his deposit. The landlord didn't bother inspecting the property when my dad moved out, instead he asked me to sign a contract stating that I would take liability for the state of the property - I signed this since it was my dad's deposit anyway and I needed to move out ASAP.One of the first things I noticed about the property was that the carpets are in disrepair. There are stains, frays and matted areas all over. It is impossible to keep feet or socks clean and the dirt from the carpets is enough to permanently stain socks. I started wearing flip-flops indoors as a hygienic solution.Since the carpets are in disrepair, I sent an email to the landlord asking for him to replace the carpets. The landlord's response was that it must be a cleaning issue and therefore he will not be replacing the carpets.My dad lived in the property for 5 years and did not once clean the carpets. I wouldn't be surprised if he barely used a vacuum cleaner in that time either. That being said, the landlord said that the carpets were \"like new\" when my dad moved in. I have been here for 8 months now. This means the carpets are likely around 6 years old.My dad is disabled and was paying for rent with disabled benefits. My brother and his girlfriend lived with him for a few years and I lived with them all for about a year. This means there was probably substantial wear & tear to consider on the carpets (which span the entire house except for the bathroom, which is lino).In addition to all of the above, when I mentioned the carpets to the landlord during an inspection, he said \"We have already noted the carpets. We will replace them after you've left.\" This to me says both that they were aware they needed replacing before I signed the contract to transfer liability, and that they recognise that they need replacing.My questions are as follow:Should the landlord not replace the carpets regardless of the situation, since they are presumably at the end of their lifespan and they have practically admitted that they need replacing?Just how much liability have I taken over from my dad? Is it even possible for someone without a disability to take liability from someone with a disability?","answer":"From the description this appears to be the tenant's problemA carpet can be expected to last 5-15 years depending on quality and usage. Signs that it's reaching the end of its life are wear, damage and tears.But that's not what you're describing. You're describing carpet that is dirty due to inadequate maintenance, and that's the tenant's responsibility. This is a direct result of your dad did not once clean the carpets. I wouldn't be surprised if he barely used a vacuum cleaner in that time either. Carpets should be vacuumed about once a week and steam cleaned every 12-18 months.It's your responsibility to clean the carpet if you can. If the tenants lack of maintenance has damaged the carpet beyond repair then that is not fair wear and tear and the tenant is responsible for its replacement. Or, at least, for a proportion of the cost commensurate with the reduction in life, say half.You have taken over whatever liability your dad hadThat's not even slightly controversial. The landlord accepted you as a tenant only because you agreed to assume the liability of the previous tenant. That's a valid and binding contract.Why do you think disability has any role here?"}
{"question":"There's  on politics SE that has some upvotes (but more downvotes) claiming (even more adamantly in subsequent comments) that standing is issue of substantial importance in criminal trials; some quotes from the claims:There is no distinction between 'civil' standing and 'criminal' standing. See .Standing (see the entries at Cornell's Legal Information Institute and Wikipedia) means in part that there must be actual or imminent harm to some person or persons. Child pornography (obviously) demonstrates actual harm to the child in question and imminent harm to other children, so the government can file criminal cases on their behalf, citing the producers and recipients of the material as complicit in that harmful act.But those links don't' really explicitly say that.So what relevance if any does standing have in criminal trials? E.g., are there any examples of criminal cases\/charges dismissed for lack of standing, by which I mean that the court decided the government lacked standing? Let's restrict the discussion to federal proceedings, for the sake of not making this too broad.","answer":"So what relevance if any does standing have in criminal trials? E.g.,are there any examples of criminal cases\/charges dismissed for lack ofstanding, by which I mean that the court decided the government lackedstanding? Let's restrict the discussion to federal proceedings, forthe sake of not making this too broad.Almost none. Conceptually, this is because a violation of a sovereign's criminal laws is an injury-in-fact to a legally protected interest of a sovereign in not having its own criminal laws violated. The violation of the law itself is the injury.Where standing type considerations apply they are usually described as jurisdiction.A sovereign, be it a state or the federal government can enforce its own criminal laws, but not another sovereign's criminal laws except by extradition.For example, a state prosecutor can't enforce a federal immigration crime in state court, nor can a state prosecutor file federal or state charges in a federal court. Likewise, a federal prosecutor can't bring federal or state charges in a state court, and a federal prosecutor can't bring state criminal charges (unless adopted by reference as part of federal law) in federal court.Criminal justice in Indian territory which is handled by the federal courts by federal prosecutors in felony cases, are a special case conceptualized either as a &quot;contract service&quot; relationship or as evidence that Indian tribes are not fully sovereign.The extraterritorial application of criminal laws is likewise usually considered a question of jurisdiction rather than standing.Sometimes the federal government passes a law incorporating some state criminal laws by reference as federal criminal laws in federally controlled territory, but that is an issue of substantive law, not standing.A handful of states allow private criminal prosecutions for select minor offenses, rather than being exclusively brought by the government (mostly on the East Coast). In those cases, standing is an issue, just as it is in civil cases. Only victims can bring private criminal prosecutions, where they are allowed, and only in cases where they are the victim."}
{"question":"This question is based on a social media post of a presumably real situation someone I don't directly know is facing.Suppose a landlord leases housing to a person, with a requirement in the lease to get a \"dog permit\" from the landlord to have a dog living in the place, and grants the permit at the time the lease is signed. Then, immediately after the person moves in, the landlord tells them the dog permit has been rescinded, with no prior communication or incident that would have caused a change in circumstances, and threatens the new tenant with eviction if they do not get rid of their pet immediately.What legal recourse does someone have in such a situation? Are there US jurisdictions where this kind of behavior by the landlord is legal? The person who it happened to belongs to one or more classes likely to be discriminated against, so these antics may be \"constructive\" to deny housing where the real intent is unlawful discrimination; if so, does that change anything about how the law sees it and how to handle the situation?","answer":"It's hard to imagine a jurisdiction where this would be legal, assuming that the facts are as you present them. Mainly, it comes down to what the lease actually says. If the lease says something that implies that landlord permission is required, then the tenant has to get permission. You can call it a &quot;dog permit&quot;, it just boils down to &quot;landlord permission&quot;. Unless the lease also states &quot;permission for a pet can be withdrawn at any time, sor any reason&quot; or something to that effect, then the dog is permitted. At the end of the lease term, the landlord can refuse to renew the lease and\/or can instead offer a no-dogs lease.The landlord's only recourse would be to petition the court for breaking the lease, in having a dog without permission, at which point the tenant would present whatever evidence they have that there was permission (hopefully something more substantial than a statement &quot;I asked if I could bring my dog and the landlord said 'hmmmm' with an approving tone&quot;). The courts will not give any credence to &quot;Yeah but I rescinded the permission&quot; unless there is a clause that explicitly allows it."}

","answer":"I assume the act was not a rape, and Jessica is older than 16. Since the act in question did not take place in the US, no US \/ Arizona laws were broken, so there will be no trial in the US. The  specifies a set of acts for which a person can be extradited: these include murder, assault, bigamy and so on, but not illegal recording. US law requires 1-party consent for recording (Jamie consents to the recording), so under US law the recording is not a felony (not a crime at all). Article II(2) specifies that other acts allow extradition if the act is a felony in the US which it is not. Simple spite (not extortion) is not a felony \/ extradition offense. Therefore, the basic requirements for extradition are not satisfied, and Jamie will not be extradited. (In addition, under Article V, a US citizen can be extradited from the US only at the discretion of the executive branch if it considers that it is proper to do so.)It is not clear whether the act is a federal crime in Australia. It is a crime to film sexual acts without consent in some states of Australia, e.g.  defines an extradition offence as   an offence against a law of Australia, or a law in force in the part  of Australia, for which the maximum penalty is death or imprisonment,  or other deprivation of liberty, for a period of not less than 12  monthsIn accordance with the US-Australia treaty Art II(2), the offense must be made extraditable under the extradition laws of Australia \u2013 it thus matters which state the act took place in (though the fact that it is not against US law is dispositive)."}

{"question":"A funny (and seemingly legal, if absurd) proposal during the current debt ceiling debate is  to reduce the debt below the limit.

I figure if it's actually stolen property, even if all statutes of limitation have passed and even if you committed no crimes in acquiring it, you'd probably be required to return it, but I'm not sure on this, especially in cases where you committed no crime yourself (e.g. if the auction scenario mentioned above occurred because the thieves dropped the coin on their way out of the building with the buyer legally and inadvertently acquiring the coin as part of the auctioned item).We can ignore the practical issues with proving it's \"the real coin\" rather than a counterfeit; I'm just curious about the legality assuming the coin was made in some way that rendered it immune to counterfeiting (handwaves explanation).Yes, this is a hypothetical, but I'd be willing to bet if any such coin existed, there'd be at least one movie made that involved either stealing it or becoming an overnight trillionaire by accident, so I figured I'd get the jump on the plausibility of such a movie.","answer":"As current law stands, it would be property of the US Mint if coined, US Treasury, if printed as a treasury note, not federal reserve note.This was decided by appellate court in regards to 1933 gold double eagles, coins that were struck, but never released to public."}

{"question":"My wife, two year old daughter and I went to a clothing store in Georgia. My daughter was being fussy after she saw some candy and soda that she just could not wait. So, I gave her the candy and soda. At the counter, their was an argument about the clothes that we were returning and it got to the point where the cashier simply refused service. The manager seemed to take her side. They would not even let us pay for the candy and soda (open items). So, we left those items in store and walked out without paying for them. If after they refused service, I continued to open new food items and partially eat them, could I get into any legal trouble for this act? Even if I am willing to pay for those items?My thinking was that they would be forced to charge me (provide service) for those items if the amount starts to add to about 10-20 dollars, which would make the manager think twice about if he should refuse service and let us walk out of the store without paying for the open items. ","answer":"As far as I can tell, that would be a criminal act.Georgia law  says:  A person commits the offense of theft by taking when he unlawfully takes or, being in lawful possession thereof, unlawfully appropriates any property of another with the intention of depriving him of the property, regardless of the manner in which the property is taken or appropriated.Georgia law  says:  A person commits the offense of criminal trespass when he or she intentionally damages any property of another without consent of that other person and the damage thereto is $500.00 or less or knowingly and maliciously interferes with the possession or use of the property of another person without consent of that person.If you know the store is refusing to sell you a product, and you eat that product anyway, that is theft. If you don't eat the food but just open it, that's still criminal trespass.  Even if you're leaving them money, you're still taking and\/or damaging their property without their consent.Additionally, if they told you to leave, and you refused and instead started opening food items, you might be guilty of trespassing in the more traditional sense:  A person commits the offense of criminal trespass when he or she knowingly and without authority... Remains upon the land or premises of another person... after receiving notice from the owner, rightful occupant, or, upon proper identification, an authorized representative of the owner or rightful occupant to depart.As to whether it was legal to give the candy to your daughter before the disagreement and refusal of service, that may depend on what the standard practice is. It seems to me that in most clothing stores you're supposed to pay before consuming the product - this isn't a sit-down restaurant. But if there's nothing else going on, I think the average store would refrain from calling the police if the person did not try to hide the evidence (for example, by stuffing the empty box on a shelf) and if the merchandise was paid for before the person attempted to leave the store, regardless of whether it's technically illegal."}

These are facts. But use of the phrases &quot;indolent expression&quot; and &quot;undulating throat&quot; might violate copyright. The original choice of words is part of Belloc's creative expression. Going further, the simile &quot;like an unsuccessful literary man&quot; is also creative, and is also protected. A clumsy paraphrase like &quot;resembling a failed writer&quot; might violate copyright even though the words are entirely different.

{"question":"Could the police still take them back home against their will or otherwise prosecute them?","answer":"Once the search goes out...Once the police get the report of a missing person and they actually do file it (which can be tricky if the person is in the 18-21 gap but much easier below 18), the missing person is in their system. Contrary to popular belief, there is no 24 hour waiting period to report a minor missing, that is a rule that only regards adults and is not universal for all agencies.Once the file is in the system, the report is reported upwards, because the states are forced to report any missing people under 21 to the NCIC under the Crime Control Act of 1990 - ). This means, even if they are 18 now, the initial report to the NCIC still went up, possibly back when it was initially reported, maybe even still if the report happens after the 18th birthday. And they are still a missing child in the eyes of the NCIC.(a)In generalEach Federal, State, and local law enforcement agency shall report each case of a missing child under the age of 21 reported to such agency to the National Crime Information Center of the Department of Justice.The entry in the NCIC database however will remain even long after the 21st birthday, as it can only be removed  by the :Missing Person: Adult and Juvenile: Retained until cancelled[sic!] by entering agency.The database for missing children is for example used by , who disappeared in 1928 and would be 96 by now. And yet, his entry is still online and can only be removed by the originally reporting agency. At the same time, more than 500 cases are people that disappeared below 18 and are now 18-21, about 400 of which disappeared between their 16th and 18th birthday.A similar database is , their 7th oldest case, their youngest case is from fall 2019 as they only list cases older than a year due to practical limitations.Once apprehendedHow each state handles found children or young adults that are reported missing is dependant on the state. Often, the act of the child running away on the own volition (or the report the child gives to police once apprehended) will trigger an inquiry by the CPS (or equivalent) into the living situation and could mandate foster care for some time or give some reasons for full emancipation - however that would be very dependant on the individual case."}
{"question":"Phrases like \"shall make no law,\" \"shall not be infringed,\" etc. seem to imply the rights are absolute. Why is this not how SCOTUS has interpreted the Constitution?","answer":"Because people inevitably come into conflict exercising different aspects of their rights. For example, the 1st amendment says that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. Someone who runs a sound truck around a residential neighborhood at 3am extolling the candidate of their choice would be exercising their right of free speech but it would be a significant negative impact on all the folks in that neighborhood trying to sleep. Governments and the courts have to balance the free speech rights of the person running the sound truck versus the rights of other citizens to go about their lives.In this case the compromise is that cities and states can pass noise ordinances that restrict the hours when amplified sound systems can be used, but such restrictions have to be content neutral."}
{"question":"Here's what I witnessed some time ago: There is a large ground level chess set set at an outdoor mall, with squares about 2x2 feet and pieces 2-3 feet high, about 5 lbs each. This chess set is usually used by small kids, 2-5 year old, who move the large chess pieces, make around themselves, pretend to ride the horses, etc.  One day a much bigger kid, 10 year old or so, apparently elated by the lack of supervision, ran into that chess playground, and started throwing the 5 lbs chess pieces with force across the chess set in random directions, sometimes missing the toddlers by inches. The thrown pieces would sometime bump the other pieces around the toddlers, sometime miss a toddler's head or leg by inches, etc. This lasted for at least 5 min.And in those 5 min of quite dangerous bombardment not a single adult would attempt to restrain the minor. Some parents would take their toddlers out of the chess board games despite their protests; some would get closer to their kids within the chess board while watching the 10-yo, apparently with intent to intercept a chess piece if it would fly at their kid; some adults would just watch what's happening from the benches. And nobody would interfere with the apparently dangerous youth, not physically, and not even verbally.I gathered from the conversations nearby that the adults were just afraid to restrain the youth for the fear of being accused later that they were doing something illegal against the minor. The parents were more afraid to be branded abusers of that child than of the physical harm said child would do to their own kids.Thus the question: how realistic where their fears in the state of California? If an adult physically restrains a child and claims that the child was a danger to others can the adult have legal problems?","answer":"If an adult had physically restrained the miscreant brat, they could be sued for \/ charged with battery (which does not mean 'beating up', per , it is the 'willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another'. In either case, there is a defense that can be mounted, the 'defense of others' defense, to the effect that the person had a reasonable belief that it was necessary to prevent physical harm to others. Which means, the jury would imagine themselves in that situation and guess how likely it is that someone might get hurt. Lofting 5 lb chess pieces at a 2 year old could poke out an eye, especially since they haven't learned to duck at that age \u2013 however, I question (as would an opposing attorney) the characterization 'quite dangerous'. At any rate, it would depend on the level of danger posed. There is also a 'proportionality' requirement for the defense of others defense: 'The defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against that danger' (CalCrim instruction 3470). The battery might not have been necessary, since simply getting between the criminal and his victims could have been sufficient. As to whether there would actually be a lawsuit, that depends in part on the mind-set of the parents. Assuming that the level of force did not rise above simple bodily contact, it is unlikely that a jury would vote to convict \/ find liable, but certainly not impossible. If under those circumstances the results would not be in serious doubt, then it is unlikely that the person would be prosecuted (the prosecutor wouldn't bother with such a case). We may also assume that a decent attorney would persuade the offended parent-client that it is not a good use of their money to pursue he matter. Still, the risk is not negligible, since you don't know whether you'll have bad luck with the jury, or whether the child suffers from eggshell skull syndrome and then you would be is serious trouble. I don't think the fears are unrealistic, though they may be improbable, and they could be definitive for people who live in fear."}
{"question":"During Congressional testimony today (03\/20\/17), Adm. Michael S. Rogers was asked (among other things) if US citizens were required to report all contacts with foreign nationals and if failure to report such a contact could result in a counter-intelligence investigation.  That seems like an obvious question, but he answered that he didn't know because he was not familiar with the law on that question.  If this were a question about US officials and foreign nationals or US officers and foreign nationals or US citizens and agents of foreign governments, then the lack of familiarity with the law would seem like a reasonable justification for not answering.  But the question was about US citizens interactions with foreign nationals.  That is such an incredibly broad category.  It encompasses any interaction of any US citizen with any foreign national.  Your cab driver had a strong accent?  Yep, that's within the category of that question.  So is every interaction with every customer support call if it's manned in India.  Or any interaction with any bank teller, flower or food delivery person who seems to have an accent.  They are all possibly foreign nationals and all fall within the category of such a question.How could he answer that he 'didn't know'?  How could the answer to that specific question be anything but a resounding 'no, obviously not'?  Would it even be legal to impose such a requirement on all US citizens?  Is there any country in the world other than North Korea which has such a requirement on its citizens?  Having said that, he could have been trying to answer the broader question (which did entail asking about whether interactions between US officials and foreign agents have to be reported).  But he answered 2-3 questions asked together with 1 answer.  It seems like the answers should have been separate because the answer to this one specific question (out of all the ones asked) should have been very different from all the others.  I guess my question is whether he had to err on being as elucidating as possible when testifying before Congress and providing as much information as he was able to?  Or should he have erred on the side off not making statements if there was any chance of them being too broad?  Is not answering questions which are very narrow-tailored, by claiming that they are too general, tantamount to refusing to answer the questions?Did he, as the head of the NSA, not just imply that it may be possible to legally require all US citizens to report to the government any and all interactions with foreign nationals?  I am not looking for snide shots of the 'nsa is wiretapping all phone calls, anyway, so why do you care'-kind.  I am trying to understand if there is really any legal possibility of US going down this path of xenophobia because of Russia.  I don't mean culturally.  I mean legally.  Is there anything to legally preclude it from happening?  And wouldn't the NSA director have to know something like this?","answer":"  I guess my question is whether he had to err on being as elucidating  as possible when testifying before Congress and providing as much  information as he was able to?

Did he, as the head of the NSA, not just imply that it may be possible  to legally require all US citizens to report to the government any and  all interactions with foreign nationals? . . .  And wouldn't the NSA director have to know something like this?I think that in a situation like this one, you are reading too much into a garbled discussion. I think that the NSA head was answering the question that he thought the person asking him the question really wanted answered, which is whether there was a duty to report contract with a foreign official in a quasi-official capacity, rather than the literal question that was asked. It is quite possible that he wasn't consciously aware of the literal question that he was asked because his brain translated it into what he believed he was being asked before he even had time to really think about it.The issue here is not a duty to be forthcoming, but a duty to try to be clear and an authority to try to understand what someone is really asking you in a question and to tell someone what they are trying to get to the bottom of. These are Senators here, taking them to task for minor verbal fumbles isn't the politic thing to do, even if it can make the proceeding a bit more complicated to follow.This kind of conservation pattern is common in everyday speech, happens not infrequently in court even though it shouldn't, and happens more frequently in Congress where understanding more than precision of speech is the goal. Generally, in ordinary conversation and even in formal testimony if someone says something that they clearly don't mean and you want to be sure of their true meaning anyway, you ask a question that makes the kind of distinction that you are making clear and confirm that this is really what the person meant to say or is really not what the person meant to say.To read more into a statement like that in that context without clarifying if what he literally said is really what he meant is really just playing 'gotcha' rather than trying to determine if there is really a new policy or if the NSA director is really taking such an extreme position.The NSA director probably knows the answer to the literal question being asked, but probably does not know the answer to the more technical question that was meant to be asked. And, when in doubt, it is better not to claim to know something you aren't 100% sure of in an official public statement.Ideally, someone would clear up the obvious mutual misunderstanding at some later point in the hearing, but following the natural tendency to answer what you think you are being asked if the question is not clarified when you give an answer that seems inappropriate to the exact question asked shouldn't be considered a major ominous policy statement or an intentional lie.  Is there anything to legally preclude it from happening? The freedom of association under the first amendment prohibits something like this from happening."}
{"question":"In South Carolina (USA), if a car is left on somebody else's land, does it become their car after a certain amount of time has passed? Is there any obligation in the land owner to attempt to find or contact the vehicle owner?Does the answer change depending on whether the vehicle registration is current?","answer":"There's the question whether something is lost property or abandoned property. You'd be allowed to keep abandoned property, but keeping lost property without looking for the owner is in many places considered theft. A car on your land is quite likely abandoned by the last driver (people don't usually lose cars). But the question is whether it is abandoned by the owner; if the car looks like it has some value then it is unlikely to be abandoned by the owner and more likely that it has been stolen. I'd report the car to the police; then it's up to them to find the owner or not. If they can find him, and the car was not abandoned, but actually lost (unlikely) or stolen (more likely), you have the satisfaction of being an honest person helping either a very stupid car owner or a crime victim to get their property back. If they can't find him, usually the property will then belong to the finder. "}

The government sought dismissal of the case because  The copyright in an architectural work that has been constructed does  not include the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public  display of pictures ... of the work, if the building in which the work  is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place.contending 'that the sculpture is part of a much larger, unitary architectural work, namely the New York, New York Hotel &amp; Casino'. The court found that the government had misconstrued the intent of that section of copyright law:  The addition of Section 120 was intended to extend copyright  protections, however, not truncate them. Previously, architectural  works had little protection because they were considered utilitarian  and not subject to copyright protection. See Leischester v. Warner  Bros., 232 F.3d 1212, 1216 (9th Cir. 2000). That changed in 1990 when  congress passed the Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act  ('AWCPA'), which added specific protection for architectural works but  with the limiting proviso, on which the government relies, that  photographs of public architectural works are exempted from  protection. Pub. L. No. 101-650,\u00a7 702-703, 104 Stat. 5133 (1990).  The AWCPA is silent as to its effect on any other section of the  Copyright Act.Thus, Congress didn't intend with that clause to withdraw copyright protection from statues in proximity to a building. Moreover, the regulatory definition of building is given :  The term 'building' is defined in the applicable regulations as a  'humanly habitable structure.'and there is no dispute that the sculpture is not a building in that sense. In short, the court rejected the claim that the sculpture was a building."}

{"question":"On 4 March 2016, the Supreme Court of Alabama dismissed a petition by conservative activist group Alabama Policy Institute and a probate judge to halt gay marriages in the state.This  by mainstream NBC News (which may have a liberal lean?) as the end of legal challenges to gay marriage in the state.On the other hand, conservative family activism and religious liberty group AFA .I was confused by the apparent contradiction between the two accounts, so I checked the . Chief Justice Roy Moore spends 100 pages explaining why gay marriage is evil and unnatural, why Obergefell was an unconstitutional opinion, why unconstitutional opinions do not creating binding precedent, what our oaths of loyalty to the constitution mean, what the difference between a ruling and an opinion is, why he needn't recuse himself, and why Obergefell only applies to the parties to the case, and not to the probate judges of the state of Alabama.Then he concludes by saying on page 100:As stated at the beginning of this special concurrence, the  certificate of judgment in this case does not disturb the March 2015  orders of this Court that uphold the constitutionality of the Sanctity  of Marriage Amendment and the Alabama Marriage Protection Act. For  that reason, as explained above, I concur.I'm confused. His discussion make it seem like AFA has reported correctly that the Alabama judiciary is taking a principled stand against the SCOTUS's decision in Obergefell. But then he concurs to dismiss the petition to halt gay marriage, which seems to have the effect of enforcing Obergefell. If he thinks the probate judges are bound to deny marriage certificates to same sex couples, why is he concurring to dismiss, instead of dissenting? Justice Bolin also writes a concurrence, where he states that despite disagreeing with Obergefell, he recognizes the authority the SCOTUS has over Alabama. That makes sense. But what is Chief Justice Moore doing here?","answer":"The U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage everywhere in the U.S.  'The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them. ... The Court, in this decision, holds same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry in all States. It follows that the Court also must holdand it now does holdthat there is no lawful basis for a State to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex character.' Obergefell V. Hodges, 576 U.S. ___, 23, 28 (2015) cited and linked by the OP in paragraph 3 of the question we are answering    The Alabama court didn't do anything about gay marriage, legalize or outlaw it, because it doesn't have the authority to do anything  'The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution of the United States (Article VI, Clause 2), establishes that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it, and treaties made under its authority, constitute the 'supreme law of the land'. It provides that state courts are bound by the supreme law; in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law must be applied. Even state constitutions are subordinate to federal law.'    The Alabama court dismissed the case because it was moot.  'In the legal system of the United States, a matter is moot if further legal proceedings with regard to it can have no effect, or events have placed it beyond the reach of the law.'     Judge Moore's 100 page Statement of Nonrecusal is dicta, the intent of which was to loudly proclaim his objection the legalization of same sex marriage, but which has no legal effect  'The law of stare decisis contains two basic and virtually undisputed principles. First, the doctrine of vertical stare decisis requires lower courts to follow a higher court's holdings. Second, lower courts are not bound to follow the dictum of a higher court. ... Dicta include 'statement[s] in an opinion not necessary to the decision of the case;' holdings, on the other hand, are statements actually necessary to decide the issue between the parties.'    'Appellate judges are careful writers, and are familiar with the principle opposing advisory opinions. Yet passages that are obviously dicta appear throughout their opinions ... 'Judge Moore's writing is orbiter dicta because it is his rejection of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to legalize same sex marriage. The issue before the Alabama Supreme Court was a request for delay of an order by the Alabama Supreme Court to deny marriage licenses to same sex couples in defiance of the ruling by the Federal District Court that same sex couples have a Constitutional right to marry and an order by that court to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples. As a result of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling, the Alabama Supreme Court passed upon the issue before it.  ''Obiter dicta' involve points neither argued by the parties nor deliberately passed upon by the court; these statements often originate with the writing judge. Obiter dicta generally have no persuasive influence.'    Judge Moore's dicta is dead because it has been explicitly rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.

{"question":"I live next to a state highway and the lot my house is on was originally created around 1960.  I purchased my house 5 years ago and the property description on the title when I bought the house describe the lot boundary as 50' measured from the center of the highway (that also tracks a section line).  Apparently the highway itself was replatted in the 1990's and it claims a 70' offset into my property.The result is that we have a 20' overlap that is claimed by both of us.  If that property was transferred to the state when the highway was last expanded wouldn't my property description have to be updated?  Is this a title insurance situation?Apart from the missing land. The reason this matters now is that they are improving the highway again and taking another 17' and do not want to compensate my for the mature trees that I have screening the house from the highway, because they are already in the right of way or on their land depending on which survey is used.","answer":"If that property was transferred to the state when the highway waslast expanded wouldn't my property description have to be updated? Isthis a title insurance situation?You aren't far from the mark, but keep in mind that in the U.S. title to real property is not represented by a certificate for a particular geographic area as it is in most of the U.K. and Australia, for example (the modern U.K. land title system was actually invented in Australia). So, unlike those jurisdictions, the full legal description of what you own may not be consolidated into a single, up to date document.Instead, in the U.S., people file various documents with the real property records (usually maintained on a county level) of the county where the property is located. These records are indexed by grantee and grantor, not by geographic location.So, in this case, someone would file a plat for the subdivision you live in and that is a matter of public record. Later on the state transportation department would bring an eminent domain proceeding to seize property for public use in exchange for fair compensation, or would negotiate a non-court ordered sale of the land. The decree transferring the property in an eminent domain proceeding and\/or the deed transferring the land to the state, would have been recorded in the real property records. But, if there was a discrepancy between how the owner of the property was described in the deed giving that owner title to the property and the name of the owner in the eminent domain matter, this decree or deed or a replat of the land might not get properly indexed.If the land was taken while you owned it, you should have received notice of the eminent domain lawsuit, although if you ignored it or failed to realize its significance, a default judgment could have been entered against you in that case with no further notice to you.If you purchased the land after the land was taken in a commercial real estate transaction, a title company should have identified the recorded documents that took that land away from you and that limitation should be listed in the deed by which you took titleSometimes the deed will simply reference &quot;all easements of record&quot; since the state highway interest will often be a very restrictive easement rather than outright ownership, since this costs the state less to acquire than outright ownership.If there is not some reference in the title commitment and the deed conveying the land to you, that references the land that the state took for the highway, then you have a title insurance claim against the title insurance company if this limitation was omitted from the title commitment, and you would have a claim for breach of warranty of title to every prior seller conveying by a warranty deed (which is the norm in arms length sales of real estate for fair market value) that omitted the land taken from the highway after the state took that land.The designation of the land taken, if it is actually an easement, wouldn't change the legal description of the property although the existing of the easement would have to be mentioned, at least in a general sense (&quot;subject to all easements of record&quot;) in the deed, and in a specific sense with a copy of instrument creating the easement in the title commitment. The draft title commitment would normally be disclosed pursuant to a real estate contract prior to closing, with an out from the contract available if the title work revealed had an unacceptable problem.Even if the land was taken outright, the change in the legal description could be subtle, such as &quot;Lot 1, Block 23 of the Amended and Restated Hillshire Subdivision Plat recorded at Book 456, page 128.&quot; And might not note that the original legal description was &quot;Lot 1, Block 23 of the Hillshire Subdivision Plat recorded at Book 34, Page 456.&quot;The change could also be stated as a reservation or limitations on the original property description, such as &quot;Lot 1, Block 23 of the Hillshire Subdivision Plat recorded at Book 34, Page 456, subject to the decree of the Hill Valley County District Court recorded at Book 455, Page 100.&quot;Apart from the missing land. The reason this matters now is that theyare improving the highway again and taking another 17' and do not wantto compensate my for the mature trees that I have screening the housefrom the highway, because they are already in the right of way or ontheir land depending on which survey is used.The state is required to pay you an appraised fair market value for the land it takes which you can dispute in court (you pretty much always have to surrender the land and the only real issue is the price). If you think that the money offered is too small for the fair market value of the property you should consider hiring a lawyer and your own appraiser to context the valuation.But, as you note, if the trees in question are &quot;are already in the right of way or on their land depending on which survey is used&quot; then you don't own them and aren't entitled to compensation from the state for taking the trees. Again, this should have been mentioned five years ago in a title commitment and if it wasn't you may have a warranty of title and\/or title insurance claim to compensate you for land you thought you were buying but didn't actually own."}
{"question":"Situation: recently, I was asked to open a locked apartment building (inside are tenant's apartments) by a police officer. I was standing outside of my apartment next door. I do have a key for that building and stated that I did but when he asked me to use it, I refused stating that I am not supposed to. He stated that I could be cited for refusing to assist him. He said he was there to talk to a sex offender. I did not ask if he had a warrant and he did not say he had one. I left after providing the contact info for the building's landlord.After some googling I found that it is a crime to not assist an officer but it seems to be limited to when that officer is making an arrest:Country: United StatesState: ColoradoCity: DenverMy Question: since the officer did not state he was making an arrest and did not provide a warrant, was I legally required to assist him in opening the door?Side Note: the officer was nocking on several people's windows and even tried to jimmy the lock with one of his keys. I also looked at the sex offender registry afterwards and did not find anyone in that building or near by. He also asked for my name and apartment number and wrote them down. The situation seemed shady.","answer":"This all depends upon where you are. I am a landlord and I am answering based upon the laws of the U.S. and the states that I operate in.First things first. You are not the property owner. While this does not limit the answer, it is a factor. You do not have the right to the property even if you have a key and the permission of the tenant. You are not the property owner, do not represent the property owner nor the tenant, and by contract do not have legal rights to the  apartment. It does put you in a different situation.As a landlord, it is against the law for me to provide access to a tenants apartment to anyone without authorization. This, of course, precludes emergencies such as welfare checks. In the case of the police, a warrant is required or a form that the police fill out that allows the police to gain access. This would be used in cases such as when a spouse requires the recovery of personal property during a domestic dispute. A judges order is not always possible in these cases. These are often limited cases and the form absolves the landlord of liability even in cases where the police act incorrectly.So without a warrant or a form that certifies any lawful request, anyone including the landlord can be arrested for a crime.For your situation, a quick call to the landlord would have been appropriate. Without a warrant or certification, the police still had options including waiting for the person in question to either leave or return to the apartment or even request a warrant by phone. Often, the warrant, once signed by the judge, can be read over the phone. Any landlord should always have a paper copy provided within minutes since some cruisers will have a printer and can print the warrant.Your refusal appears to be legal. However, in the future, you can ask for a copy of the warrant that you provide the landlord.I do not wish to paint a negative image of the police who do the hard work that most people will never take on, they are after all heros, however, some do not know the law perfectly well especially tenant landlord law. As well, some will try and get away with skirting the law trying to get an important job done. It does happen. I hired a lawyer just last week for an illegal request unrelated to the question here.Addressing the OPs comment:  Hello, I believe I misstated the situation a bit in that the locked  door in question was for the apartment building and not a tenet's  apartment itself. I have edited my question. Does this change  anything?Technically, this does not change much of anything, however, the request by the police can be seen as a reasonable one. They just may want to talk to the individual which is reasonable. In this case, I might have let them in if the access I was giving them was to a common space such as a hallway. In this case, the outer door locks are only to keep Intruders from entering the building and not meant to restrict access for valid purposes.Are you in trouble? I would say no. If anyone asks, you can give reasonable arguments for your situation. However, the next time, consider what I have written here. The police have a tough enough time doing their jobs. If you can help and stay within the proper boundaries of what the law allows, that would be best."}

Indeed, usually it will be more specific than city and state or province and will also identify a hospital or residence or other place where the birth happened.So, for example, if a child is born to U.S. diplomats in Paris, France (in or out of the embassy grounds), the birth certificate will say that the child was born in Paris, France at Charles de Gaulle Hospital.But, that child will still be a U.S. citizen in all likelihood, because that child's mother, and\/or married father or unmarried father who acknowledges paternity, is a U.S. citizen (in all likelihood) pursuant to 8 U.S.C.\u00a7 1401 and 1409. The child may or may not be a French dual citizen depending upon the citizenship law of France.In the case of a French diplomat who has a child born physically in Washington D.C. (inside or outside the French embassy) the birth certificate will likewise state that the child was born in Washington D.C.The French diplomat's child, however, will not be a U.S. citizen since Section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution's first sentence (which is also found in 8 U.S.C. 1401(a)) states:All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject tothe jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and ofthe State wherein they reside.But a French diplomat's child is not &quot;subject to the jurisdiction&quot; of the United States, so the French diplomat's child does not gain U.S. citizenship at birth (assuming for simplicity's sake that both of the child's parents are French citizens and are not U.S. citizens) despite the fact that the child was born in the United States."}
{"question":"I have seen a lot of claims made about \"gain of function\" research in regards to corona viruses, one of them being that it is or was \"illegal\". I wondered whether or not this claim was true at the time that some entities (NIH, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, other government organizations, etc.) were funding and\/or conducting gain of function research themselves.It seems the NIH did place a moratorium on funding gain of function research starting in October 2014 and rescinded it in December of 2017. ()I found  that was introduced by Sen. Marshall in October 2021, but a) it is not law, just a bill, and b) cannot be used to ex post facto criminalize behavior that had already been committed (US Constitution, Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3).QuestionsWas funding \"gain of function\" research by government institutions ever illegal? If so, starting when?Was conducting \"gain of function\" research by government institutions ever illegal? If so, starting when?I have not seen this question asked here before, a quick search I was able to find the following question but it doesn't delve into whether either conducting this research or funding it was or is now illegal.","answer":"Senate Amendment 2003 was an amendment to an amendment to a bill which did not pass: it would have permanently ban all funding of gain-of-function research in China. Senate Bill S.3012 likewise did not become law. Furthermore, economically bans gain-of-function, and does not criminalize anything. It says &quot;Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no research grants supported by Federal funds may be awarded to institutions of higher education, or other research institutes, that are conducting gain-of-function research&quot;, meaning a total shut-off of federal research money to an institute that engages in such research. But it didn't happen, so it is still legal."}
{"question":"I have a question about contract law within the following scenario:Say the original contract\/engagement letter is for 2 tax filings with Acme Tax Accountants.

This service is performed and paid.The next year a third tax filing is done by Acme Tax Accountants but no new contract\/engagement letter has been signed with the client. At the end of this service a $1,500 invoice is sent (a 50% increase).My understanding of contract law is the original fees are implied if no new explicit agreement is signed and therefore the invoice amount should be $1,000.

{"question":"I'm a UK-based singer-songwriter. I've had a demo of a duet I wrote professionally recorded by two session singers in the US, as my voice wasn't what I wanted for this one. Piano track is essentially as I wrote it, there's an added cello part, and the vocal melody\/harmonies\/lyrics are all mine. But what's the right\/legal thing to do re: releasing this on Spotify - do I have to pay the singers\/cellist a % if and when I clear the costs of recording, etc? And if so, does this mean that I'm in effect becoming my own publisher? I know nothing of how this all works, but I do know this is by far the best and most commercial song I've written to date - and it's a Christmas one, so I'd really like to put it out there and earn some of the production costs back.","answer":"There's a long and solid history around 'demo' recordings.  Demos are...well...for demonstration.  For shopping.  For a work-in-progress reality check.  The session musicians get a different, lesser scale for 'demo' work than they do with 'master' work.  ('master' being a track intended for release\/distribution).  It has of course happened many times that a demo ends up being better than the master, and gets released.  In a formalized contract situation (read: union), what would happen is that the session would be retroactively upgraded to a master session from being a demo session, and the players would get a bump. Those hired players would not typically get royalties though.  In today's world, the notion of back-end royalties is essentially moot, or even (not)amusing. Mind you, I'm talking USA...UK is not quite the same kind of animal, though it's similar."}
{"question":"I'm not a lawyer, and this is a hypothetical situation that I thought about while watching a trial.If a prosecutor issues a subpoena for someone to testify at a trial, it's my understanding that the prosecutor needs to tell the defense about it by providing them the list of possible witnesses.If so, the defense generally has the ability to speak to each of the witnesses, correct?  What if a witness refuses to speak to the defense lawyers?  For example, if they witnessed a crime and dislike the defendant because of it, so they don't want to speak to his lawyers.  Or, what if a defendant is (stupidly) representing himself and the witness doesn't want to speak to the defendant?I believe the subpoena requires the witness to testify at trial, but does it also require them to speak to the lawyers if the lawyers reach out to them to get their story prior to the trial?  Or maybe is the prosecution required to provide the defense team the information that the witness will testify to in the trial anyway, so this is irrelevant?  Can this come up in pre-trial hearings, and can a judge require information to be shared prior to trial if deemed appropriate?I'm also assuming that the information has to be shared in some way, but maybe that's incorrect as well.","answer":"the defense generally has the ability to speak to each of the witnesses, correct?No.The defense is only entitled to see what evidence the witnesses have provided so far, and what they are intending to give at the trial.

{"question":"I know this would probably depend on the state and city, but do cities have any recourse for monopolistic behavior? For example, say a parking provider buys up all of the parking in the city and begins to charge monopolistic prices for parking. Does the city have any recourse to break up the parking provider, or force them to sell off some amount of parking?","answer":"States can, and some states do, have 'mini-Sherman' anti-trust laws of their own. Whether a city could have such a law would depend on whether the state had delegated that power to cities. I haven't heard of a city that has such a law, but I haven't really looked.Or if a state has a 'mini-Sherman' law, a city could perhaps bring action under such a law, depending on its exact terms.Or a city could impose a licensing scheme on a specific industry that also prevented a monopoly, similar to the requirements that many cities and towns place on taxicabs, or on bars. Both of those typically limit the number of units that a single entity may own. So perhaps it could be done for parking."}
{"question":"Claims of executive privilege seem to be a cautionary claim - cautioning someone to not disclose inner workings of the executive branch. It is a preventive claim - preventing someone from releasing those details.What is the remedy if someone violates executive privilege? Is there any statue criminalizing the violation of executive privilege?On a related note, if the damage is done - something really crucial to the executive branch is revealed - can there be any remedy to that or is the genie out of the bottle? For example, could the information be used in a suit against the USA or will the presiding judge throw out evidence obtained through the violation of executive privilege?","answer":"Executive Privlege is the President stating that material sought by the judicial or legilsative branches are personal communications about policy decisions or matters under confidence or advisory (i.e. Attorney Client Privilege or an Advisor laying out numerous options, some of which are legally questionable, but are not acted upon).Typically, Executive Privilege will block all executive agencies (most of the Federal Agencies of government are executive) and employees from speaking on the matter or releasing requested documents claimed Privileged.   If an employee speaks on the matter to congress, the president's recourse is to fire them (since executive employees ultimately serve at the pleasure of the President and this behavior will likely displease him).If the employee has left the job and then speaks, it depends on the nature of the breech (attorneys can be disbarred for violating privilege with their clients) and whether any non-disclosure agreements were signed (which were probably signed as part of the hiring process well before they became privy to privileged info and for this reason).  NDAs don't prevent speaking, but will count as a civil violation if one speaks in a manner that violates the terms of the NDA.Similarly, the use of the speech as evidence in any proceeding depends on the nature of the proceeding and how the material is obtained.However once out, you cannot 'unring the bell' and people are going to know what the guy said."}

But we are unsure as to whether the copyright holder has the technical right to go on and sell this work under a totally different license, and who would enforce it if they didn't anyway?I've tried scouting copyright law for clauses on this, but as one might expect it's rather impenetrable. I feel this should be an obvious question, but at the same time I don't know the law's wording on the alienability of the authors' rights.

Can a copyright holder 'waive' their right to redistribute their works under other licenses?","answer":"The copyright holder is free to release the work under whatever licenses the copyright holder wants, in the absence of a contract saying otherwise.  A copyright holder could sign a contract not to release under another license, but otherwise I don't see why he or she would waive the rights.  The copyright holder can always decide not to reissue under a different license.The copyright holder basically retains all rights not specifically signed away.

{"question":"I am not familiar with USA laws, but I saw that Maine and Vermont are the only states where felons never lose their right to vote. Is this true? Does that include all elections (I.e., local, state, federal)? Are felons in other states not allowed to vote in any type of election?","answer":"The question is answered at the level of state law. It does seem that Maine and Vermont are the only two states where felons never lose voting rights (, the latter pointing out that this also applies to Puerto Rico and Washington, DC). Following the second link, you see that states vary in their restrictions, for example Mississippi only restricts voting rights for certain Mississippi crimes, whereas Washington doesn't care about the source of the conviction, and voting disability is lifted once you are released from prison. Illinois includes misdemeanor convictions, but has the &quot;while incarcerated&quot; rule.

To spare you the full read of the decision, it can be summed up thusly:  First, states (California) cannot censor their citizens in order to make a civil society. Second, knowing where to draw the line between harmless heightened emotion and vulgarity can be difficult. Third, people bring passion to politics and vulgarity is simply a side effect of a free exchange of ideasno matter how radical they may be. famously decided to not define what merits obscenity beyond 'I know it when I see it.' which basically states that obscenity laws are passed at the lowest level of government, not nationally.  What is obscene to a small mostly elderly conservative Christian town in rural Florida is 'meh' to Los Angeles.There are a few SCOTUS decisions regarding school speech but these basically are with regards to the School's role as a disciplinarian and still would not catch ire with the Courts if you were to wear a political statement such as that.   held that the school could not suspend students for wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam war, but speech that was disruptive and school newspapers could be censored (so long as they were the product of journalism classes and not a 'community forum'.  Actual community News Papers (most colleges) cannot be censored.).In all matters of speech law in the United States, the burden of proof is on those seeking to restrict speech, not the speech maker, that the speech is not protected under the First Amendment.

That might get into a whole host of 'censorship' issues.Such a domain would be a form of labeling, and thus at least arguably a form of compelled speech. By making it easy to filter out such sites, it arguably denies them participation in a public forum based on their content.Also, existing domain\/site names have been treated as a form of property, and so there might be eminent domain issues when a site has spent significant resources in promoting a given URL.But the only way to know for sure would be for such a law to be passed and then challenged in court.

Please include sources.Thank you in advance!","answer":"You want to exercise your  under the GDPR. The link is to the UK Information Comissioner's Office, which is a good source of authoritative information about the GDPR. Note that in these quotes &quot;you&quot; is the organisation holding the data.The GDPR does not specify how to make a valid request. Therefore, an individual can make a request for erasure verbally or in writing. It can also be made to any part of your organisation and does not have to be to a specific person or contact point.So any demands that you snail-mail a copy of your drivers license are out of order. Under the GDPR it doesn't matter how you make the request as long as it is clear. Send an email. They should at least email you back with details of the information they need to identify you exactly, although your email address should be just fine in most cases.If you have disclosed the personal data to others, you must contact each recipient and inform them of the erasure, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. If asked to, you must also inform the individuals about these recipients.So as well as requiring that your data is deleted you should also require that this request be passed on to anyone they have shared your data with, and they should delete your data and pass the request on in turn. Also ask them for a list of everyone they have shared the data with so that you can verify that this has been done.Your biggest problem will be that many of the organisations on the web page you link with are American, and some are going to think that the GDPR does not apply to them. :This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:(a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or(b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.So as long as you are in the EU then the GDPR covers your data, even if it is being processed outside the EU.Of course your practical remedies against foreign corporations are rather limited: trying to haul them in front of an EU court is going to involve vast time and expense, but if they won't comply you should make a complaint to the ICO or the equivalent in whatever EU country you are or were in. One complaint on its own won't do much, but I dare say that dossiers are being prepared and someone in the EU has these information leeches in their sights."}
{"question":"The question is simple, but the situation is anything but. The bare bones info: my friend's son is a new driver who just had a minor, but scary, brush with the law. There is an extra car in this family, as my friend's husband kept his existing car when he purchased a newer one. Hoping to get her son's attention, my friend would like to store his somewhat sporty car at another location, while her son would drive her own 15 year-old car, and she would use her husband's older car. This way the stored car would be an incentive toward some improvement and responsible behavior on her son's part, before it would be his to use again.My friend's husband is refusing to 'allow' her to use the car, as his way of forcing his own idea that the sporty car should be sold as a punishment. Does my friend have a right to the car as marital property, even though it's in the husband's name only? They've been married 25yrs, so everything mentioned here has been acquired during the marriage, and, if it matters, she is the primary earner, but did not pay for the car.I'm not intending this as a discussion of parenting, and no one is talking divorce or any other legal action, I would simply like to know whether the car is jointly owned (and hers to use) under NJ law, even though his name is the only one on the title. I hope this is an ok question for this site. Thanks much!","answer":"New Jersey is not a community property state, but it is an  state. This means that in a divorce marital property is divided, not automatically 50-50, but in a way that seems financially fair to the supervising judge, or according to an agreement entered into by both spouses. This also means that the state considers a car bought during the course of the marriage 'marital property'. There are also special rules for property bought before May 28 1980, which do not seem to apply in the case in the question. However, 'marital property' mostly applies when a marriage ends which the question says is not in view here. NJ does allow for a car to be titled to only one, or to both. A title with both names may read 'John Doe OR Mary Doe' or 'John Doe AND Mary Doe'. In the AND case both spouses must sign to sell or borrow against the car, in the OR case either signature will do. If only one name is on the title, that person must sign to sell or borrow.If it comes down to a dispute, the person whose name is on the title can decide where it is to be garaged, and who has permission to drive it. If the 'sporty' car is in the name of both parents, either could move it to some other location, and either could move it back. Going back and forth could easily get ugly. If both names are on the 'sporty' car's title with an OR, the husband could sell it without consulting the wife. if there is an AND he would need her to agree.If the older car is in the husband's name alone, he could deny the wife or the son the right to drive it.The wife could, of course, buy a different older (used) car and allow the son to use it.Obviously it would be a good idea if the husband and wife came to a voluntary agreement about all this, but no law requires them to do so."}
{"question":"Imagine two file hosting websites. Perhaps Dropbox and Google Drive.Now imagine a third file hosting service. However, what it does is grab your file, split it in two chunks, encrypt both of them, and upload one to Dropbox and another to Google Drive (then it gives both download links to the user).Even if the service detects that the files are illegal, it is not storing them itself, but rather uploading them to other hosts.Assuming that people use such service to upload illegal content, would such service be technically illegal?What if the service keeps a list of all download links for anyone to download from?Mostly curious about Canadian and US jurisdiction. ","answer":"If it was illegal to make the entire copy, it is illegal to copy half the file.  See also, e.g., Basic Books v. Kinko's Graphics Corp., 758 F. Supp. 1522 (S.D.N.Y. 1991)In response to the question of whether moving it to someone else's servers makes a difference: it is the act of copying, not the possession of the copy, that is the violation of copyright law.  As for the copy a service assists someone to make, contributory liability would be the issue.  You don't need to be the person making the copies to be contributing to the infringement--material contribution to the copying process and knowledge of infringement run a serious risk of creating contributory liability.  If seriously considering such a service as a business model someone would need to consult a copyright expert with technical knowledge or pay counsel with technical knowledge for a good bit of time to do some research.  There are major civil and criminal consequences if the industry or the government decides to go after a service doing this, so legal expenses would be a significant and important cost of doing business that would significantly increase barriers to entry.In addition, the service would likely be in violation of its agreement with storage vendors, who would want to minimize their legal exposure and might well discontinue the service when they learned what it was doing."}
{"question":"A business injures a customer. The customer sues and seeks to pierce the corporate veil and hold the business owner personally liable.The customer is able to present evidence of misconduct satsifying the state's test for piercing the corporate veil, but only based on actions that occured after the injury. In other words, the business was being operated up to the time of the injury, but the owner began mismanaging it some time later.Can the customer still hold the owner personally liable? I'm looking for cases addressing this question.","answer":"There are several concepts that are very closely related: piercing the corporate veil, the alter ego doctrine, and fraudulent transfer laws.Lots of conduct that does not qualify for piercing the corporate veil, or the alter ego doctrine, can still be used to hold the owner liable for a fraudulent transfer.Usually, if the owner transfers an asset from the company (even something intangible, like business prospects) without substantially equivalent value being paid in exchange, or if the owner takes actions calculated to make the entity debtor affirmatively hinder a creditor or conceal assets, there is a fraudulent transfer and the transferred asset can be recovered by the entity's creditors.Paying bona fide valid insider debts before paying third-party creditors can also constitute a fraudulent transfer that can be recovered.The remedies available against the business owner personally would also depend upon the precise nature of the misconduct.Keep in mind that in an action for a tort, like negligence causing personal injury or professional malpractice, anyone who participated in the negligence that caused the personal injury has personal liability, notwithstanding the fact that this person was acting in their official capacity for the company while doing so. So, the details of who was involved in causing the injury to the customer matter. In a small closely held limited liability company, the owners is often personally involved in tortious conduct.For example, suppose that a small closely held company makes a defective product and sells it to a customer who is injured by the defective product.Certainly, the company that sold the product would be exposed to product liability claims from the injured customer.But, if the small company only has one or two people who design and manufacture the product, and one can prove that they were involved in designing and manufacturing this particular product (e.g. a custom item), then the individuals involved in designing and manufacturing the defective product have personal liability in tort in a product liability suit, not just the company.On the other hand, if the liability is purely for a breach of contract, or the company is liable vicariously for conduct of someone other than the owners or managers or officers, and if the company made no fraudulent transfers, and was operating with proper formalities at the time of the incident, piercing the corporate veil, or applying the alter ego doctrine could be much more challenging (although, of course, the law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this is largely a matter of state law)."}

{"question":"Somebody sued me for breach of contract. The case is in circuit court. The judge gave a trial date. However, plaintiff sent me an updated complaint copy after that. I thought it's just an update. I didn't do anything. After exactly 30 days, I got a motion notice that he filed against me for default decision. I am in the state of TN. Motion date is after 2 days. What are my options? 1 - Should I submit a reply to motion or just go on motion date to verbally explain?2 - What to do about the notice? Should I also prepare a reply to the updated complaint?3 - Could court simply follow the law and give a decision in his favor as I didn't reply to him within 30 days? ","answer":"It appears from your post that (1) the plaintiff amended the complaint (i.e., what you think was 'just an update'); (2) you did not know that you had a deadline to file responsive pleadings to that amended complaint; and (3) having missed your deadline, the plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment.Your mention [in the comments] that the plaintiff already lost this case in small claims court suggests that the current complaint is his attempt to re-litigate matters (that is, a matter that is res judicata).If this is so, you should file a response to that motion and your responsive pleadings. There you need to point out --and preferably attach evidence-- that the matter is indeed res judicata and that therefore the court should dismiss the case. This is not necessarily the only defense available to you in the pleadings you file but, without knowing the specifics of your matter, it is impossible to identify what else would be appropriate for you to argue.You could just show up at the hearing for default judgment, although that is strongly discouraged. It is better that you file your response to the motion &amp; pleadings ASAP. First, because the dynamics of the court hearing might prevent you from adequately presenting your arguments verbally (let alone having them properly assessed by the judge). And second, to ensure that the record of the case clearly reflects your arguments &amp; evidence in the event that this goes to the appellate court.At this point it seems obvious that you have little-to-no time to become acquainted with TN court rules, aka procedural law or rules of procedure. Same with legal theories, contract law, statutory law, and rules of evidence. But even if you are unable to search for records of other proceedings litigated in your court, you should at all times strive to present and prove your arguments in writing and verbally as clearly as possible so that a judge (assuming that he is not so sloppy or negligent) grasps the merits of your legal position."}
{"question":"Consider this scenario:Alice publishes a work A under CC-BY-SA-3.0.Bob makes a derivative work B from A, and publishes it under CC-BY-SA-3.0.Charles makes another derivative work C from B, and publishes under CC-BY-SA-3.0.A and C don't share any content, or resemble each other in any way.If some third party infringes on the license for A, it's clear that Alice has standing to issue DMCA takedown requests for material that infringes on A. However, it's unclear whether Alice can do the same for B or C.If some third party infringes on work B or on work C, does Alice have standing to issue a DMCA takedown request against the infringing use in each case?","answer":"You have the cart before the horse here, tiger. Copyright holders do not enforce licence terms, they sue for breach of copyright. Copyright works that have been used with permission (which is what a licence is)are not breaches of copyright. Those that have not been used with permission are breaches.If C's work does not contain any of A's copyright material (either original or derivative work) then A has no grounds to sue for breach - the licence is immaterial.To issue a DMCA take down notice, A must state:That the notice is filed in good faith That all information in thenotice is accurate That under penalty of perjury, the originator isentitled to act on behalf of someone who owns an exclusive right that is, a copyright  currently being violated.If A has a good faith belief that C is violating their copyright, they can issue the notice. The fact that C has cited A as a source (even if they actually aren't) is probably enough to support such a belief."}
{"question":"Are there any legal impediments to  a song with melody and lyrics copyrighted in the United States---with the same melody but with different lyrics---on U.S. streets?Does it matter if the song is to be sung not for money, but to deliver a message; i.e., to make a statement?","answer":"A song with the same melody and different lyrics is a . It does not matter whether the song is to be sung for money, or not. The copyright owner still retains the rights to the melody, and can deny anyone permission to use it in a derivative work.Furthermore, using the derivative song to make a statement does not restrict or reduce the rights of the copyright holder. Refer to , below.See: Derivative works can be created with the permission of the copyright owner or from works in the public domain. (...) The copyright for the derivative work only covers the additions or changes to the original work, not the original itself. The owner of the original work retains control over the work, and in many circumstances can withdraw the license given to someone to create derivative works.And: As the Supreme Court explained in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., Parody needs to mimic an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its victim's (or collective victims') imagination, whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrowing.Also: Within copyright law within the United states, such mechanical licenses are compulsory; any party may obtain a license without permission of the license holder by paying a set license fee, that as of 2018, was set at 9.1 cents per composition or 1.75 cents per minute of composition, whichever is more, which are to go to the composition copyright holder. (...) In American law, US Code Title 17, Chapter 1, Section 115(a)(2) states: &quot;A compulsory license includes the privilege of making a musical arrangement of the work to the extent necessary to conform it to the style or manner of interpretation of the performance involved, but the arrangement shall not change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work ...&quot; thus preventing mechanical licenses being used to make substantially derivative works of a piece of music. (...) For example: Puff Daddy wants to sample the opening riff from Every Breath You Take by The Police. (...) He is free to hire musicians to reproduce the Police's sound, but he cannot copy from any phonorecord with only a mechanical license."}
{"question":"Does the mechanism by which federal judges are chosen in the USA consider things like how many warrants issued by the judge were overthrown? Is this type of thing a professional embarrassment for a judge, a blight on his record so to say or is it so common as to not matter to a judge?I would be interested to know on what basis federal judges are chosen and reinstated and what effect overthrown warrants would have in this process (if at all)","answer":"In the U.S. Federal judges are appointed by the president and confirmed by a vote in the senate. There are no professional qualifications required.They serve for life unless removed by impeachment or they resign.  Some have resigned due to scandal. Some have been impeached and some voluntarily retire."}
{"question":"Are NFL athletes employees of their teams, or are they contractors? Are their civil protections similar to a normal person working an office job?","answer":"NFL players are employees covered by a , part of the AFL-CIO, which indicates specific different civil protections compared to an office job.  This is a two-way bargain, not categorically better or worse.  On one hand, many office workers receive severance pay at the discretion of the employer; NFL players are entitled to specific dollar amounts based on service (Article 60 in the link above).  On the other hand, in the event of a dispute, the union, speaking for employees, has agreed to defined arbitration processes instead of individual members being able to bring a lawsuit against the teams or leagues.  This is of note as there was a union lockout in 2011.  The union dissolved itself, and 10 players were able to bring a lawsuit against the league to challenge the .    Decertifying the NFL Players Association enabled the players to file antitrust litigation against the owners, which they did late Friday, with superstar quarterbacks Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Drew Brees among the 10 named plaintiffs."}
