{"question":"I have been reading a little about the housing mortgage crisis of 2000s.  I have found some articles on the internet, some inference and intuition that has lead me to believe that many banks in fact wanted individuals (poor credit rating or not) to default on their mortgage payments.  Often using predatory tactics to induce certain behavior upon borrowers.  In similar suit, the various USA governments have enough motive to keep large sums of money that initially are expected to be returned to the payer upon completion of obligation.  Does anybody have stats that show how often bail money is returned vs kept by the system?","answer":"Bail money doesn't really work like a loan. Bail, or bond, is a guarantee to the court that you will appear to answer for your charges. It can only be taken if you fail to appear or abscond. This is complicated by bail bonds companies, which pay a bond for you for a fee, betting you will appear. The bonding company can avoid defaulting on a bond by sending a bondsman to come drag you to court if you miss it.I'm also interested in those statistics. The best I can find is an  forfeiture rate.

{"question":"Does the fraud requires the fraudulent transaction to be paid or it already constitutes fraud by the time the fraudulent service or good is offered? Or is there any other moment when the fraud happens?","answer":"Fraud' is roughly lying to get something that isn't yours - for example, my money. It turns from attempted fraud to fraud at the point where I would be defrauded if we both take no further action. That would often be the point where I hand over the money, for example if you offer goods for sale that don't exist and that you don't intend to deliver. If you fill out a form and forge my signature to get money, and send it off to someone who will give you the money, it would be fraud at the point where I lose my money if we both take no further action. That might be the second where you drop the letter in the mailbox. "}
{"question":"Ive had a number of initial consultations with various attorneys for estate planning and entity structuring, and almost every one of the opinions Ive heard is different and often contradictory. If I just choose one on a hunch to proceed with and they turn out to be wrong (e.g. results in higher tax liability than they claim or doesnt protect my assets as they claim) is it possible to recover damages from them (e.g. make a claim on their E&O insurance)? It seems like the engagement agreements Ive been presented with suggest no guarantees, no warranties. One even says the company isnt in the business of providing legal services, and if considered to be legal services they retain the right to facilitate use of attorneys to complete the work (even though it also says all members of the company are licensed attorneys, and they have even emailed me with a note stating that communications are under attorney-client privilege). I assume these are ways they avoid any liability if they are wrong, so how can you hold an attorney accountable?","answer":"Yes. Lawyers are generally subject to a malpractice lawsuit, essentially the same as doctors and other professions. A successful claim generally requires proof that the lawyer's services fell below the standard of care for attorneys, and that it resulted in some injury to you."}
{"question":"This question is about English-language 'news' sites (i.e. sites that have articles about something new that has happened in e.g. science, technology, or some other area of interest) which I am guessing are located here in USA, for the purpose of my interest in limiting the jurisdiction in this question.In this case this question is specifically related to writing 'news' articles about news that are covered at other news sites.The issue is that I have frequently seen different sites write articles about something new that has happened and these articles often make a reference to some other news site where the news item had first appeared.The questions I wanted to ask are:Is this thing of copying the gist of a news item, or paraphrasing anews article that has appeared at some other site, copyrightinfringement?Or is it covered by the fair-use laws that exist in USA?If it is not covered by fair-use laws, how do so many different newssites get around writing about the same subject without infringingon a copyright? Are there some informal agreements or formalcontracts that cover for this?","answer":"The pattern that you are probably referring to is well over the line of 'fair use', especially when articles appear in multiple outlets with vast amounts of verbatim copying. There is no way for a reader to know if the article is a licensed copy, versus a pirated copy, except in the rare case that the article includes a by-line indicating that it comes from e.g. the New York Times. UPI, AP and Reuters were big agencies that distributed news articles -- they still operate, but don't seem to insist on the by-line as they did in the 60's."}
{"question":"I am a minor living in the state of Massachusetts and I am interested in getting a 'doing business as' \/ Business certificate. I am already doing business in my town (online sales), however, I wanted to get an official business registration for tax \/ other related purposes.Earlier, I called my Town Clerk's office (they are the ones that take in \/ manage business certificates) and at first they said minors could not start a business. This prompted research into Massachusetts state law and I got a call back from the Town Clerk themselves who told me there were two issues with me getting a business certificate:Minors could not be notarized.Minors cannot enter a legal agreement. (They gave an example of if you were doing babysitting for a customer, you could not be held contractually liable because you are a minor).The Town Clerk also stated herself that the state of Massachusetts had nothing in their laws regarding businesses (sole propreitorships) that there was an age requirement.The first point of theirs is simply not true and I have found several sources saying it's perfectly fine in most states (Massachusetts included) but that they recommend the Notary explain what the minor is signing. Furthermore, later when I talk with the Town Clerk, they state that they (they also provide Notary services) would not notarize the document because I am a minor.My response for their second point was that the town had no jurisdiction about business to business or business to customer contractual relations and that their only job was to recognize the business.Today, I went to a Notary Public and got the form for my town (for a Business Certificate) notarized with my signature. I met every requirement outlined by the Business Certificate. After going to the Town Clerk's office, they presented me with an email from another Town Clerk who cited the Age of Majority for Massachusetts. Their argument was that because the town considers the Business Certificate to be a 'legal document' and because as a I minor I am not fully legally capable of entering into an agreement, they could not and would not accept my completed Business Certificate. My general reply to that was that I was not agreeing to anything in the business certificate rather that I was simply notifying the town that I was doing business in it.Even when I suggested that I get my parent to be an officer as well (I really do not want to have to do this), the Town Clerk stated that they would probably deny that too since I am listed as an officer and a minor cannot be held liable. However, the Town Clerk said that they would have to check with the Town Council.In the mean time, is there anything I can do? The state does not restrict any age ranges to start a business and it is just my town that is causing a problem.","answer":"If you are correct that the local government has no legal basis for refusing you a Business Certificate (and I'm not saying they do or don't), you can apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a writ of . This is an order of the court that basically tells the government to do the job the law requires of them."}
{"question":"Normally, an  is a company in which another company or entity has a minority interest. (This is different from a subsidiary, in which a company has more than 50% control.) Under those circumstances, I don't see how the company can bind its affiliate in a contract.But Company B signed a contract with Company C, binding itself to sell all of its widget production, and that of its \"affiliate\" A, at a fixed price to C. In the relevant contract, Company B defined \"affiliate\" (perhaps improperly) as a company it controls. In point of fact, the \"control\" percentage was 80%.Can Company B so bind A with 80% control? How about 40% ownership?","answer":"It sounds like you may be conflating ownership and control. It's very common for an affiliate to have a contract with the parent company. These terms can be very detailed - it may give the parent company the right to sell the affiliates widgets, but not sprockets (as those are sold by another parent company). As such, you can't really measure control as a simple percentage.So, when the parent is selling widgets, it can reasonably claim control over its affiliate. The buyer does not need to know the exact terms governing the relation between parent and affiliate."}
{"question":"A company allows eligible person to use their service at a discounted rate. Somebody would like to enjoy the discount but was not 100 percent sure about his eligibility. He then simply submitted the application, provided no fake documents, and the application was approved. The time was 2015.That person needs to renew his subscription annually, and the most recent (and successful) renewal occurred on March 2017. Before that the T&C has changed, of which the person is not aware. Additionally, the T&C applicable to the every-year subscription is the then-effective one at the time of renewal.On June 2017 the company decided to terminate the service to the person because they think he is not eligible. In the T&C the company does have the right to 'verify the eligibility of the person and terminate the service to the ineligible at any time'. However before the termination the person has made several successful payments (on a monthly basis), which are also accepted by the company. I may safely assume here that the company has approved the person's eligibility for this year's subscription? And since the most recent renewal there is no change in the T&C, and no change in the person's status since 2015, from which I would like to assume no reason for invalidation of his eligibility.Is my logic legally valid?Location: WA, United States","answer":"  the company does have the right to 'verify the eligibility of the person and terminate the service to the ineligible at any time'is pretty unambiguous.  They have assessed your eligibility, determined you don't have one and have terminated the service. They are completely within their rights to do this.If you feel that they have assessed your eligibility wrongly then you can dispute their assessment - either through whatever dispute resolution is detailed in the contract or by going to court if the contract is silent.The fact that they previously assessed you as eligible (or didn't actually make an assessment) is irrelevant."}
{"question":"I watch the show Ridiculousness quite often.  At the beginning of every episode is a disclaimer stating that MTV doesn't accept video submissions, because they want to avoid liability for encouraging people to do stupid, dangerous things just to be on TV.Does something similar apply to journalists with regards to stolen information?  Or are they allowed to implicitly encourage theft by publishing known stolen info?I am aware of this , but I don't think it quite duplicates my question.  I agree it's similar, but not perfect.  Not all information theft is electronic.","answer":"It is fairly well established that a journalist does not have liability personally for receiving information distributed without authorization by someone with a duty to maintain a government secret. On the other hand, personally stealing such secrets or soliciting someone to do so for you is probably some form of illegal espionage.There is ongoing litigation, and the answer is not uniform in all jurisdictions, over whether a journalist may be compelled by subpoena to reveal a confidential source who illegal disclosed a government secret, or whether a journalist's sources are subject to a legal privilege not to testify. Most journalists compelled to testify by subpoena decline to do so anyway despite being incarcerated for contempt of court.Receipt of a private trade secret knowing that it is misappropriated is a basis for a civil action for damages and injunctive relief, even for a journalist, although the issues of a privilege for confidential sources is the same and unresolved. A journalist is not authorized to personally steal, or to solicit another to steal, a trade secret which is a crime.For secrets other than trade secrets and national security secrets there is less well developed law and different domains have different consequences. The consequences of leaking private educational information are probably minimal or non-existent.For example, I haven't seen any law considered HIPPA protected secrets stolen by, solicited by, disclosed to, or revealed by journalists. I have no strong sense of how such a case would come out, and that resolution would depend upon how the case was presented to the courts and by whom.There is also a common law privacy tort for revealing private or confidential facts, which is acknowledged in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, but is far from universally adopted by all jurisdictions in the U.S. as a private common law basis for a lawsuit, and this has to be balanced against First Amendment concerns.There is case law out there that shields journalists from business torts (e.g. intentional interference with contract) that amount to defamation claims, by the same defenses that apply to a defamation claim. But that doesn't necessarily resolve the separate kinds of interests inherent in a privacy tort claim."}
{"question":"I was recently reviewing the contents of a contract agreement (US Based company) when two parts struck me as being particularly harsh. The parts of stick out to me in particular are: Clause 3: 'Therefore agrees that during or after the term of this Agreement'  How can a company stipulate a condition after an agreement finished and over. Surely there must be a limit or it will be enforceable for the duration of the persons life. Clause 4: 'If any court refuses to enforce this Agreement, or any provision hereof, because it is more extensive (as to time, definition of business of otherwise) than is necessary to protect the business and goodwill of the Company, Employee agrees that this agreement, or the offending provision hereof, shall be modified to the extent necessary to permit the terms to be enforced in any such legal proceeding'  This seems to state that even if a court decides that some parts are not enforceable, we reserve the right to change them until we can get damages from you in any way. This sounds very harsh. (Full image of the specific clauses are .)I was wondering if:These statements would stand up in a court of law?Whether companies are allowed to make these types of statements? Whether employees have the right to push back and ask these to be changed?","answer":"YesYesYesHowever, these are pretty standard contract terms.Many, many terms survive the end of the substantive agreement. For example, terms with respect to ongoing confidentiality, dispute resolution, warranties, termination itself etc.The second is so common it actually has a named legal doctrine: reading down. In the absence of such a clause, if the contract inadvertently exceeds what the law allows, it preserves the contract rather than leaving both parties without contractural protection."}
{"question":"I've heard that most municipal code is actually copyrighted material, thus, for example, you can't just re-publish it without violating the copyright law.The issue becomes interesting in the case of secession.  If, say, a California or Colorado county, city or a set of such were to secede from the rest of the State, or from an existing county or city within the State, do they have to start their legal framework pretty much from scratch, could they reference prior state\/county\/city law as of date of secession, or do they somehow get some kind of a special right to the collection of statutes?  Can the old jurisdiction prohibit such access?From the copyright perspective, would it at all be easier for a state to secede (e.g., ), since I presume constitution is in the public domain?  What about the rest of the federal laws?  (What about most state laws, in case of a county-to-state succession?)","answer":"Well, states cannot secede. . . . No, the state laws are not copyrightable.For Federal Laws:Copyright protection under  is not available for any work of the United States Government, but the United States Government is not precluded from receiving and holding copyrights transferred to it by assignment, bequest, or otherwise.   In Nash v. Lathrop, 6 N.E. 559, 560 (Mass. 1886), the court rested this conclusion on the unfairness of limiting publics access to the rules that governed its conduct:        Every citizen is presumed to know the law thus declared, and it needs no argument to show that justice requires that all should have free access to the opinions, and that it is against sound public policy to prevent this, or to suppress and keep from the earliest knowledge of the public the statutes, or the decisions and opinions of the justices. \u2026 It can hardly be contended that it would be within the constitutional power of the legislature to enact that the statutes and opinions should not be made known to the public.

{"question":"I would like all my copyrighted works into the public domain immediately upon my death (rather than the current United States law specifying that it will be released 70 years after my death). Is this possible to do, for instance by putting a statement to that effect in my last will and testament?To clarify, I would like this to be for all works not otherwise specified in my will, including those unpublished. For instance, if I scribbled something on the back of a napkin that becomes valuable after my death, I want it to be in the public domain instead of retaining copyright.","answer":"Under US copyright law, all works are protected by copyright except for . The concept of 'public domain' is not legally well-defined, and is used colloquially to refer to government works, works whose protection has expired, works available to all, and works not copyrightable (such as scientific laws or old software). Under older copyright law, releasing a work without the copyright symbol effectively put the work in the public domain.One can simply say 'I dedicate this work to the public domain', and that is typically taken to be enough. CC0 purports to do this (using more words). However, as far as I can tell, author rights under European law are so strong that it is simply impossible. Releasing works into the public law has to be consistent with other aspects of the law. If you grant an perpetual exclusive right to copy and distribute to a publisher, their right does not go away on your death (a right which they would not have with a real public domain work).A problem is that an author who makes such a dedication (a bare license) could revoke the license and reassert their copyright. They could be estopped from making that argument. As property, your heirs would inherit the copyright and could (try to) revoke the license. Presumably the courts would not allow them to pursue ostensive infringers. Nevertheless, your plan is neither trivial nor bullet-proof."}
{"question":"I am a student software developer in NY, USA. As a learning project, I created a mobile application for calculating scores of my favorite crossword board game and posted it on the famous online markets. I am making no money on it. The name of the application is the following \"[CROSSWORD GAME NAME] Score Calculator\".6 months after I published my app, I received a copyright infringement letter from the [CROSSWORD GAME NAME] company. The reason for complain is following:This developer uses [CROSSWORD GAME NAME] trademark as the dominant portion of the name of their apps, which is not distinguished by any other mark that would identify an alternative source for the goods\/apps.I suggested the new name for my app \"Calculator for [CROSSWORD GAME NAME] Score\" to the company's trademark lawyers. In my understanding, the newly proposed game name would be considered nominative fair use of the trademark.But the lawyers opposed to my suggestion:It is not acceptable, nor is it nominative fair use of the [CROSSWORD GAME NAME] trademark. Nominative fair generally applies to comparative advertising, parody and noncommercial use of trademarks.  Including someone else's trademark in your own trademark (which is what an app title is) does not fall within the nominative fair use exception because you use [CROSSWORD GAME NAME] trademark as a trademark for your product  an app  and the statutory language in 15 U.S.C. 1115(b)4) specifically states that the defense applies only where the use of the name, term, or device charged to be an infringement is a use, *otherwise than as a mark\" (*emphasis added). An app name functions as a trademark for the goods.If I remove the game's name from my app title, I'm afraid people won't be able to find my app anymore. I see that many other apps on the markets whose app title includes the game name.Do you think it is possible to use \"Calculator for [CROSSWORD GAME NAME] Score\" despite what their lawyers say?If not, how can I keep the game's name in the app title?

{"question":"Say Alice from the defense\/prosecution meets with Bob, some expert\/witness, to establish some \"facts\", and then Alice agrees to call Bob to the stand to establish those \"facts\" for the court.But when called the the stand, Bob presents the opposite statements, and completely sabotage's everything Alice was banking on.Are there any repercussions for Bob, or anything to dissuade him from doing this? Because if there are no repercussions, what's stopping Bob from going to the opposing side to accept money\/a favour to do this for them?Also, just to be clear, consider the topic to not be a \"fact\", but more so something that is highly contested\/controversial. E.g. some \"experts\" may classify someone as insane, while others would classify the opposite, meaning there's no actual undisputed \"fact\" per se, and any \"expert\" is at liberty to think one side or the other.As one final example about a bad-acting witness\/expert, consider the following scenario: Alice wants to establish her client was suffering some malediction. What's stopping her from calling Dr. SnakeOil (or Dr. Oz) to testify as such? Does the expert have to be established as legit by going through some interview as if he were applying to a company?","answer":"The first thing to keep in mind is that, before appearing on the stand, an expert witness will have given a sworn deposition and delivered a written report of his or her findings.  They could expect to be questioned about anything they say under oath that contradicts something else they said under oath.  Its not illegal for an expert to admit they were wrong before, or that there are other facts that support a different conclusionindeed, a witness on the stand might be obligated tobut it might not do their professional reputation and their credibility with the jury any good, either.In the U.S., the opposing counsel is generally allowed to contact a witness, and take a statement, but may not ask the witness to testify falsely or offer any inducement prohibited by law.  (See Supreme Court Rule (SCR) 173\/Model Rule (MR) 3.4.)  It would certainly be illegal for a witness to take money from both parties in the case without informing them or the court, or to swear that whatever the highest bidder pays them to say is their expert opinion.If this happened under direct examination, the lawyer would probably cut their losses by asking no further questions and getting the witness off the stand.  Putting the witness on the stand would give the other side an opportunity to cross-examine them.  Grilling your own expert as a hostile witness, even if the judge allowed it, would only make your position seem tendentious.  Nothing stops an expert witness from giving testimony that is more helpful to the other side.

My psychologist doesn't directly act on my statements, but does share my statements with third parties.  Due to those statements those third parties cancel contracts with John Doe, stop buying products from John Doe, etc.Could I use as a defense against defamation the fact that I thought my statements to John Doe wouldn't be shared with anyone?","answer":"Yes.Making statements in a legally protected confidential context is not publishing them, and in most jurisdictions, defamation must be published to create a cause of action. In such a case the patient might well have a cause of action against the therapist for violation of patient confidentially, and a complaint to the relevant authority could get the therapist's license revoked, or perhaps a censure from the licensing authority, whatever it is the the jurisdiction.Note published does not have to mean putting them in print, but does mean making them in such a way that general circulation of them is plausible.In addition, such statements may be coered by a qualified privilege. In  the Maryland Supreme Court (reviewing a case from the Court of Special Appeals) held (at 135-136) that:... the common law recognized that a person ought to be shielded against civil liability for defamation where, in good faith, he publishes a statement in furtherance of his own legitimate interests, or those shared in common with the recipient or third parties, ...The Maryland court went on to quote the Restatement (Second) of Torts, (Scope Note preceding \u00a7 593 (1977)) which states that if a privilege were not granted:information that should be given or received would not be communicated because of [the] fear of . . . persons capable of giving it that they would be held liable in an action of defamation if their statements were untrue.It would seem that a statement by a person to his or her own therapist, as a part of therapy, and intended to be held in confidence by the therapist, ought to fall under this definition of privilege, although I cannot find any actual case with this exact fact pattern.If the person knew or had reason to know that the therapist was likely to repeat the statement, that would be different. If the person and the therapist were not in a practitioner\/patient relationship, with its normal expectations of confidentiality, that also would be different."}

MEJAallowed persons who are employed by or accompanying the armed forces overseas may be prosecuted under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 for any offense that would be punishable by imprisonment for more than one year if committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.The Blackwater employees were not charged for war crimes under the Geneva Convention but for manslaughter, attempted manslaughter and a weapons violation.Now to the question of President Trump's pardon legally violating the obligations of the Geneva Convention.Assuming that the Geneva Convention applied to the Blackwater employees and their actions at Nisour Square, from a U.S. perspective a treaty cannot alter the President's constitutional powers.The second article of the Constitution of the United States, in Section 2, states:...he shall have the Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.The law upon which the Blackwater employees were convicted was U.S. law; an offense against the United States and, therefore, a pardon for a conviction under this law is within the President's constitutionally granted powers.In , the U.S. Supreme Court made it clear that treaties cannot alter constitutional powers:It would be manifestly contrary to the objectives of those who created the Constitution, as well as those who were responsible for the Bill of Rights -- let alone alien to our entire constitutional history and tradition -- to construe Article VI as permitting the United States to exercise power under an international agreement without observing constitutional prohibitions. In effect, such construction would permit amendment of that document in a manner not sanctioned by Article V. The prohibitions of the Constitution were designed to apply to all branches of the National Government, and they cannot be nullified by the Executive or by the Executive and the Senate combined.There is nothing new or unique about what we say here. This Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty.The pardon issued by President Trump was legal from a U.S. law perspective. As such, it represents an official action of the United States. This would leave it to the United Nations to determine if the U.S. was in violation of any treaty. Given the difficulty in establishing that the Geneva Convention even applied to the actions of the Blackwater employees it seems a stretch to think that the U.S. would be found in violation."}
{"question":"A random idea I had based on shows like squid game, or others that feature death games.In a real world setting in the USA, you have knowledge and details of an ongoing criminal organization without ever participating or working with them.You intend to come forward to the police with that knowledge with the intent of taking down or hindering said criminal organization before filing for witness protection.Lets say in front of you is a lockbox containing ten million dollars in illegally gained dollars by the organization.You decide to take it on your way out.Could you publicly and legally declare the money you stole without any legal repercussions?","answer":"Not with AssuranceThat the money was already stolen, or otherwise illegally gained does not entitle the whistleblower (who I will call W) to take it. W is still guilty of theft. The authorities might choose not to prosecute W, because of W's assistance in hindering the criminal organization, assuming that assistance proved as valuable as W expects that it will. But they might choose to prosecute W, and if W openly declares this money, it might provide the evidence needed. Depending on the exact details of the situation, of course.Also if W wants to take this money into witness protection, it might make it easier for the criminal organization to trace W and take revenge, and eliminate W as a witness. That is a significant added risk, and the witness protection program might refuse to accept W under those conditions."}

Or is there more to it?","answer":"Passing the bar exam allows one to get a license to practice law. It is to some extent like a certification exam. It is in all US states a crime to practice law without a license. Exactly how practice law is defined varies a bit, but holding yourself out as a lawyer, opening a law office, or taking money for representing people in court is petty much always included. Other related things are often included also. Even if one has passed law school and thus earned a law degree, it is a crime to practice law without a license, and one cannot obtain a license without passing the bar exam.In some states it is possible, but hard, to pass the bar without a law degree, in some a degree is required.so the main thing a law student cannot (legally) do that one who has passed the bar exam can is practice law.<h3>Legal Sources<\/h3>I found this definition of the practice of law on an :The practice of law is defined in the Maryland Code as follows:(1) Practice law means to engage in any of the following activities:<br \/>(1) (i) giving legal advice;<br \/>(1) (ii) representing another person before a unit of the state &gt; (1) &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) (iii) performing any other service that the Court of Appeals defines as practicing law.<br \/>(2) Practice law includes:<br \/>(2) (i) advising in the administration of probate of estates of decedents in an orphans court of the state;<br \/>(2) (ii) preparing an instrument that affects title to real estate;<br \/>(2) (iii) preparing or helping in the preparation of any form or document that is filed in a court or affects a case that is or may be filed in a court; or<br \/>(2) (iv) giving advice about a case that is or may be filed in a courtMd.

For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.

{"question":"Suppose the following facts:  Alice contracts to buy a car from Bob for $10,000, in a negotiated and relatively simple written contract between competent parties.Alice takes the car.  Edit after Mowzer's answer: Assume Alice has taken full legal possession of the car, which Bob permitted based on her contractual promise to pay $10K.Alice does not pay.At some point thereafter, Alice crashes it or it is otherwise destroyed so the car can't be returned.  The destruction was not due to any negligence or tort on Bob's part nor any defect in the car. Bob would rather have the $10K than have the car back anyway; that's why he sold it.Bob sues Alice for breach of contract, alleging the facts above.At trial, Alice does not dispute the basic facts about the contract or what happened.The jury awards Bob $5,000 on his breach of contract claim.As a second example, consider the following fact pattern (if commenters think this is sufficiently different, I can make it a separate question; otherwise it seems likely to be labeled a duplicate):Downtown League (DL), a popular non-profit, hires Candace, an out-of-state singer, to perform at their gala fundraiser event for $10,000; $100 due and paid at signing and the rest due 20 days after the event.   Downtown League is in charge of all promotion and ticket sales; Candace only has to show up and perform.   The gala event doesn't sell nearly as many tickets as was anticipated, despite a last-minute push to get people to show up and buy tickets at the door.  The bad weather doesn't help.Candace shows up and performs for a small audience, fulfilling her part of the contract.  Downtown League realizes they cannot both pay Candace and have a successful fundraiser.Downtown League does not pay Candace.Candace sues for breach of contract and Downtown League doesn't dispute the facts above.Candace sues in the jurisdiction where Downtown League is headquartered and where the event was held, to resolve any questions about jurisdiction.The jury finds Downtown League to be in breach of contract.The jury awards Candace $4,900 in damages on that breach of contract.Is the jury just allowed to do that, effectively changing the price agreed to?  What would happen next, if anything?  Are there clear precedents\/sources that bear on this? Assume a trial court with no relevant cap (i.e. the jury could have awarded $10K or more if they wanted to).The essence of the question is that Bob\/Candace fulfilled his\/her obligations under the contract, and Alice\/DL did not.  The juries appear to have changed what Alice\/DL's obligations are under the contract (e.g. because they're sympathetic to defendants Alice\/DL or because the defendants have painted plaintiffs as selfish for even trying to enforce the contract, etc.) and want to give defendants better deals than they originally signed.  Can they do that, and arbitrarily change the terms of the contract after the fact?  If they do, what happens next (if anything)?","answer":"You're missing some pretty important details in describing the facts of this case.The most important of which is: What were the agreed terms upon which Alice obtained possession of the car prior to paying?Your description says:  Alice takes the car and doesn't pay.If that's literally true, then this case is both criminal theft and the tort of conversion  not breach of contract. Since the remainder of your question references a breach of contract, then I have to conclude that the fact as you stated it is not literally correct and there is some important missing detail about the terms upon which Alice was in possession of the car when she crashed it.So, I will have to invent some scenarios that would fit two other facts you describe:The jury awarded Bob $5,000.The jury found Alice to be in breach of contract.The following are the scenarios I can think of that would match the facts (as I understand them and speculated where important details are missing from the question).Maybe this is a small claims court and the damages are capped at $5,000? I never heard of a jury trial in small claims court but I guess it could be possible. Or maybe it was actually a judge and use of the term jury was careless or otherwise inaccurate?Maybe the terms under which Alice was in possession of the car when she crashed it put the parties in position where they effectively shared liability or risk of damage to the car? Like maybe Bob (or both parties) was\/were required to carry insurance on the car while Alice was 'test driving' it. I only use the term 'test driving' as a placeholder for whatever she was doing with the car prior to paying for it which is left unclear by the question.Maybe Bob was found to have contributed to the breach of contract by something he did or didn't do. Similar to the above speculation about insurance. All this would be much easier to analyze if we knew how and under what terms Alice came to possess the car.Maybe there was only $5k of damage done to the car? Or, alternatively, the car was only found to be worth $5k and, for whatever reason (again, which we can not fully analyze given only the partial set of facts presented) the liquidated value of the car was the basis for the damage award and not the contracted price. (Consistent with @jimsug's comment.)I can easily imagine a scenario where Bob and Alice are close friends or family so the entire transaction is handled very loosely and informally and Bob let's Alice drive the vehicle while she is gathering the money to pay him. In this case, the jury might decide Bob shares the liability with Alice since the terms of the sales contract did not transfer the risk of liability to Alice during the time she was driving prior to payment."}
{"question":"TL:DR, is this insurance company acting in bad faith?  Are their actions grounds for a lawsuit?  If not, what are the repercussions for what they and their client are doing?Four months ago, I was sideswiped on the highway.  The responding state trooper took statements from both drivers, and upon hearing that they matched and put the other driver at fault, he determined the other driver to be at fault.  A visual inspection of damages by the officer put his repair estimate at less than $1,500, which meant the collision was non-reportable and didn't merit a ticket for the other (at fault) driver.The driver told their insurance (who shall not be named) that I merged into their lane and hit them.  This conflicts with what they told the state trooper.  At the time, I had liability insurance, and since I was not at fault, my insurance company has refused to touch the claim.  I have been dealing with the other insurance company since the day after I was hit, but no matter what evidence arises, they and their client maintain that I hit them.My claimsI was in traffic moving at what seemed like 30 mph.  I was not watching the speedometer when this happened, just maintaining safe distance from the car ahead of me.I was travelling in the lane adjacent to the left lane.The left lane was in bumper to bumper traffic. Suddenly my car was rocked and a loud crunching sound happened.  Idecelerated, and checked behind me to see a vehicle partially inmy lane.Since there was a wall of cars on the left, I gestured to the other driver to go to the right shoulder, proceeded there myself, and called the police to send a responder.Insurance claimsAllegedly, their driver has told them that I moved into their lane to cut them off.Allegedly, their driver maintains this story (as of last week).Since the damage is on my rear left, they believe that their client is credible as they think it is my blind spot.FactsAn autobody shop discovered that the impact beam is compromised, and offers no protection anymore.  Their estimated repair cost is a minimum of ~$3,700.The responding officer maintains that he believes the other driver was at fault.  This was based on the statements he heard from both drivers and from his experience of looking at cases like this one.The officer has backed this up with notes he took at the scene, which clearly indicate what happened and who is responsible.The insurance company reviewed the notes and refused to settle the claim on the grounds that the officer did not witness the crash, and therefore could not have possibly determined the cause.The insurance company is downplaying the fact that the officer spoke to both drivers, and is pushing the narrative that it is his opinion based on reviewing damages.Despite being told by the officer during a phone call that he spoke to their client as part of his process for determining what happened, the insurance company is now insisting that the officer never spoke to their client.  The company is also refusing to make further contact with the officer to clarify once again that he spoke with their client.Despite this happening in July, and me generating the claim on the day after the incident, the insurance company took weeks to obtain a statement from their driver.It took two months for the insurance company to establish contact with the responding officer.  During that time, I had to hound them to reach out to him.  They sent 2 emails (one of which had the wrong address and didn't reach him), and made about 3 phone calls where they left voice messages.  These calls were made after 4pm, despite me relaying to them multiple times that he works in the morning, and would not be at his desk that late.  They said that this was a satisfactory effort on their part to establish communication, and refused any further attempts to reach out.  They eventually got in contact because I had to ask the trooper to contact them.After speaking with the trooper, the insurance company did not notify me.  They also did not answer my phone calls, respond to emails, or respond to voice messages for one month.Upon finally getting someone to answer, I was informed that the claims adjuster's boss had spoken with the trooper.  I asked them what was said, and they read off their boss's notes that the trooper did not file a report, but did have notes indicating who he thought was at fault.  The next day, I got in touch with the boss, and upon asking him what was said during the call, he informed me that there were no notes indicating who the officer thought was at fault.  I immediately requested he make a conference call with his employee, who opened the call notes again, and told me for the second time that there was no report, but there were notes.  The boss asked the employee what they were reading, to which they replied these were the notes taken by the boss.  The boss told her to read it again, to which they read the same thing for the third time.  The boss reprimanded her, stating that there were no notes.  The employee flatly stated that they had read the transcript incorrectly, and that the trooper had not offered any notes.  The trooper later insisted that he had offered the boss his notes from that day, and that the boss had declined to accept them.After three months of requesting these notes for myself, I finally obtained them.  Upon presenting them to the boss, he claimed that I had never instructed the insurance company to obtain these notes, but that I had requested something else.  I have a saved email where I clearly tell them to acquire anything and everything generated by the trooper from that day.After the insurance company denied the damage images I sent them, the testimony of the officer, and the personal notes of the officer, I was forced to fill out an FOIA request to obtain audio recordings from the officer's body mic.  What I received is unusable (13 seconds of audio while the officer is driving to the scene), as the officer's mic was not functioning.This request was delayed because the insurance company promised to fill out the request, but then a week later denied having done so, saying that I had promised to fill it out.I save all my emails and record all my phone calls.  The two members of the insurance company self identify themselves when I call, so I can prove that I am speaking to them, and that what I tell you they said is what they said.Grievances against insurance companyTheir lack of effort in establishing initial communication with the state trooper.  This led to him remembering the details of the accident less clearly, and having to rely on his notes.Their poor attempts at performing an investigation of this claim.  They refused to contact their client in the aftermath, saying thatthe client was on vacation.They habitually misaddress emails and calls, leading to longer leadtimes for information.They refused my numerous offers to inspect my vehicle.They refused to peruse the officer's notes, and refused to obtain them when offered by the officer.The boss at the insurance company says that it is impossible to tell who is at fault from the damages, despite the officer maintaining that the damages show it is the fault of the other driver.They made no attempts to contact me after speaking with the officer, and did not respond to me for a month.They habitually claim that people did or said things contrary to what they actually did or said.  They refuse to contact the officer when there are disputes over whether or not the officer told them something.The boss reprimanded his employee, telling her to change her statement about the existence of notes from the officer.  The new statement contradicts what she she told me three times on different days, and what the officer says he told the boss.After denying all the evidence I and the officer provide them, the insurance company is telling me that they will not settle my claim.  They haven't approved or denied it, nor have they contacted my insurance company, despite claiming I am responsible.  The boss at the company keeps challenging me to take his client to court.  Surely their poor actions in this matter merit some form of repercussion, right?  If I do go to court, can I add charges for more than the estimated cost of repairs?  Charges for having to jump through all the hoops set up by the company.","answer":"There is no case (for you) against the other driver's insurance company. That company and the driver have a contractual relationship whereby they must defend the driver against legal claims and pay any judgments against him. If you can prove that your side of the story is correct when you sue the driver, you may be awarded damages. If you had collision insurance (which I take it you did not) then your own insurance company has an obligation to pay the damages (they would then go after the other guy). Your insurance company has no obligation to the other guy, and vice versa. As they have pointed out, your recourse is to sue the client: and no, you cannot 'penalize' the insurance company because they did not roll over and pay your expenses. Nor can you penalize the other driver for not rolling over and paying your expenses. "}

S provides the price x, F provides the solution. However, F decides to provide a solution that is uniquely identifiable, thereby knowingly sabotaging their solution. The student S turns in the solution, F identifies it and therefore F fails S and takes disciplinary action for cheating.F returns the money to S later and was always going to do so.However, F and S had a contract. I assume F is breaching the contract to provide a 'valid' solution by providing a solution they know will not do what the student wants it to do, even if it looks like it would. Let's take US law for reference though I suppose it would be more or less the same in many jurisdictions.Is F liable for the breach of contract and what possible damages could they be liable for? Would it be a realistic scenario that the student sues F for getting them thrown out of the school if that happens and gets a compensation for that? Or in other words, apart from probably beeing ethical, is it legal to place a trap for the student?","answer":"The contract is almost certainly void as it is .

{"question":"Is it legally permissible for co-inventors to sign a Power of Attorney (PoA) document at separate locations with only their own signatures in the witness of independent notaries, leaving everyone else's signature blank, and then return the original hand signed inked individual documents to the law firm, if they are unable to meet at the same location due to time or financial constraints?N parties, 1 Document, N parties signing 1 Document with N-notaries asynchronously","answer":"Yes.This is legal and it is done routinely. It is called executing a document in counterparts.To be clear, however, as the language of the question is ambiguous on this point, each signature would have to be contemporaneously notarized by the person notarizing that particular signature.In each case that a notarization took place outside the country where the Power of Attorney is to be utilized, normally, it would be necessary to also obtain an apostille for that notarization. An apostille is an official declaration of a designated official in the country of notarization that the notary of the signature in question was, in fact, a notary in good standing at the time that the notarization was done."}
{"question":"For example, lets say I was starting up a gun company. I drew up and planned my perfect pistol, and now I need to build it to test it out and see what to fix. I use a 3D printer to create metal gun parts for the pistol, which I put together by hand. Would it be illegal to 3D print a gun to test out a design for a company without licenses?USA, Maryland","answer":"It would probably be illegal to do so without a license. The key fact in my mind is:   lets say I was starting up a gun company.There are some exemptions from the requirement to obtain a license to manufacture guns, for example, for very low volume production of certain kinds of guns for personal use as a hobby in your own home. For example, if you want to make a black powder musket for personal use in your basement or garage, you are probably O.K. to refrain from obtaining a license.But, if you are doing this through a gun company, with a purpose of ultimately making commercial sales of products based upon one of your prototypes to third parties, for profit, at any volume that would ultimately be high enough to be profitable, the kind of exemption that might exclude a single firearm manufactured in your basement as a hobby for personal use is not going to apply to your gun company.:  A Federal Firearms License (FFL) is a license in the United States  that enables an individual or a company to engage in a business  pertaining to the manufacture or importation of firearms and  ammunition, or the interstate and intrastate sale of firearms. Holding  an FFL to engage in certain such activities has been a legal  requirement within the United States since the enactment of the Gun  Control Act of 1968. The FFL is issued by the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE, commonly known as the  'ATF').The type of Federal Firearms License required would be a 'Type 7' license, assuming that the pistol in question did not qualify as a 'destructive device' and was not designed to have armor piercing ammunition. An additional Class 2 Special Occupational License would be required if it was an NFA (National Firearms Act) weapon such as a fully automatic machine pistol.Additional fees and licenses would be required if you made ammunition for the pistol as well as the pistol itself."}

{"question":"My understanding is that the burden of proof in a tort case is . that is, more likely than not. Consider the following:Defendant hits the plaintiff. The plaintiff suffers a broken arm, and did not have one before he was hit. The act was witnessed by several people. I would guess that plaintiff would likely be able to prove his case by preponderance of evidence. Is that likely to be the case?The plaintiff was also hit in the arm a few seconds later by a third party, X. This confuses the picture. A medical examination of the arm shows a broken bone by one blow, and internal bleeding by a lesser blow. So consider the following cases:Case 1: The defendant is 6'0', 180 pounds, and X is 5'4', 120 pounds. (He may be even weaker, basically, 'weak' to the point where he could not have administered the harder blow without an adrenaline rush.) I would guess the preponderance of evidence would work against the defendant. Is that the case?Case 2, a: The defendant is the 'weak man,' and X is the stronger. I would guess that the preponderance of evidence would work in favor of the defendant. Is this true?Case 2, b: The defendant is the weaker, but yelled at the plaintiff prior to hitting him, possibly creating the required adrenalin rush. Does this impact the result in 2a?Case 3, Defendant and X are of equal size, leading to a 50-50 chance that each cast the harder blow that probably broke the arm. In addition, there is a non-zero chance that the softer blow may also have broken the arm, through leverage, etc. The defendant clearly cast one of the two blows. Does the preponderance of evidence work against him?One more thing. Under  Assault and battery is a crime, and even a 'bystander' can become an accessory or accomplice that is equally guilty with the principal, if there was a relationship between them, or if they acted in concert (confronted the plaintiff together). Could defendant and X share criminal liability at least in Arizona? Does this extend to civil liability?","answer":"You are starting with a very confused notion of proof and evidenceI'm going to ignore your examples because they simply confuse things. The plaintiff makes an allegation; therefore the onus is on the plaintiff to prove the allegationThat means they must prove the facts that demonstrate that each of the elements of the alleged tort has taken place. For your example of battery; the elements are that the defendant (1) voluntarily took (2) positive action (3) with the intention of causing contact with the plaintiff (or another in the case of a 'swing and a miss and a hit') that (4) directly causes contact.It doesn't matter if that contact caused a broken arm or, indeed, any injury to the plaintiff - battery is actionable ; it doesn't need to cause damage. On the facts you state, both the defendant and X committed battery.In order to prove each of the elements, the plaintiff will provide evidence to the effect that each of the things that are required to have happened, happened. The defendant will introduce evidence showing that at least one of the things that are required to have happened, didn't happen. The trier of fact will give weight to the evidence (i.e. decide who, if anyone, they believe and who is selling a crock of s&amp;%t) and decide whether the plaintiff has proved each element to the required standard: for , this means they are satisfied it's more likely that the things that are required to have happened, happened rather than they didn't happen.If they do that, they have proved their case. However, the defendant may raise available defences. For example, necessity, self-defense, and consent are all defenses to battery. However, it is now the defendant alleging that these circumstances apply so the onus of proof is reversed.Now you may think that who has the onus of proof when we are just looking at 'more likely than not' doesn't really matter but you would be wrong. For example, if the evidence is questionable (e.g. the only witnesses are the parties themselves in a 'he said\/she said' situation where each clearly has an interest to distort the facts in their favor -intentionally or unintentionally) and one is not more credible than the other, remembering who has the onus suggests that the person who had it didn't meet it.Only if liability has been established would the case move to the question of the quantum of damages.

{"question":"I have heard about certain cases involving the public trust doctrine. There have seemingly been cases where lakefront property owners are trying to change the law in the U.S. to have their property expanded. My understanding is as of now property owners own the land down to the high water mark (in most states. Some states seem to have different definitions of this while still asserting public use). The beach or seashore between high and low water marks belongs in public trust.So basically the public has the right to access the beach between high and low water marks. For example, according to  Massachusetts and Maine allow the public to access the seashore between the low and high tide lines for 'fishing, fowling and navigation.'If this applies to all the shoreline in the U.S., given that the laws haven't been changed in states, why are there still 'private beaches'? Are properties labeled as 'private beaches' not accessible to the public? Or should the question be: Is there such a thing as 'private beach'?","answer":"Having owned property that abutted federal waters, I can tell you it matters whether the waters are federal or state. The Army Corps of Engineers provides a .

{"question":"I wondered to myself if there was a specific point within the 12 mile US territorial sea where individual U.S. state law ends and only federal law applies. For example, could an individual\/business create an offshore site that is just outside of the local state's legal reach but still under federal law? To my surprise I could not find anything general like: \"State law ends 3 miles from shore\" or \"State law ends 1 mile from shore\". Apparently there's ambiguity.Found a summary here:There has been tension for decades between the federal government and the states over who has control of the waters out to the three-mile  and more recently 12-mile  limit. The tension has been largely over control of mineral rights rather than how other laws are applied. Is there a line at all?I'm confused... if it's unclear where state laws end and federal law begins how do local authorities even know when to call the feds when they find something suspicious\/\"criminal\" offshore?How do individuals even know which, if any, state laws apply when they are offshore? But remember that my question is about the border line(s) so saying simply that there's a list of water patrol laws for a particular jurisdiction would not (in my view) answer the question.I found an example of a kind of border in \"The Marine Unit members are also cross-certified Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers, and are empowered to enforce federal regulations far beyond the limits of State of Florida jurisdiction.\" . But it doesn't really answer the question.","answer":"The answer is more complicated than you may think.  The over riding controlling authority is the Law of the Seas treaty signed by almost all nations but not ratified by the US (mainly because the LOS requires equal distribution of mineral wealth in the oceans).  A lot of what the LOS covers is what is called the COLREGS which are basically traffic laws for vessels on the oceans.  But COLREGS are applicable in some, but not all US federal, state, and local harbors.  While the US Coast Guard is the primary enforcer of these laws in the US plenty of other law enforcement agencies have agreements with the USCG to enforce the rules.  While you mentioned a local county agency that has agreements to enforce this, and other laws, so do a host of other agencies.In Florida the FWC is the primary enforcement agency for Florida laws and has an agreement with the USCG and other federal agencies to enforce not just Florida laws but US laws as well.  One historic area of conflict has been fishing laws.  The US claims a 200 mile economic zone and enforces fishing laws, which sometimes conflict with Florida laws (things like how big a fish must be and how many you can catch and when you can catch them).  The FWC has a much greater presence on the water and the USCG does not really deal that much with fishing.  On the other hand the USCG spends lots of time with drug interdiction and illegal alien interdiction.As an example of how convoluted this can get I was in the Dry Tortugas when the FWC boarded a commercial fishing boat anchored close to me.  The Dry Tortugas is a National Park so under federal jurisdiction and the fishing boat had anchored rather late at night and turned on it's working lights and and was loudly running a water pump during turtle egg laying season so the rangers in the park called the FWC to come down hard on the boat.  The only violation the FWC found was a pistol on the commercial boat (firearms are prohibited in the National Park).Another example is that according to Florida Law a boat in a recognized anchorage on a mooring ball does not need to display an anchor light after sunset.  While Boot Key Harbor in the Keys is a recognized anchorage run by the city of Marathon it is under COLREGs and you must display an anchor light on a mooring ball; something that I have seen enforced by both USCG and FWC.On the East Coast of Florida in the crowded ICW both city and county LEOs in boats enforce things like speed limits and boating while under the influence; not to mention drug enforcement.Bottom line is while federal, state, and local laws are not always the same there are wide spread agreements that agencies from all three  levels of government can and do enforce each others laws."}
{"question":"An example of this is, let's say someone is accused of animal cruelty (misdemeanor) and has 10 animals involved, would it be fair to charge this person with 10 counts of cruelty to animals? Even though it is from the same incident and a first offense? Wouldn't this be double Jeopardy? Especially if the sentence stacks among charges, like for example let's say each charge carries a sentence of 3 months probation, would it be fair to charge the same person (all from the same incident) with 10 counts of cruelty to animals and have a maximum sentence of 30 months probation?To be clear, in my state the \"cruelty to animals\" charge is very vague and no animals need to be dead or hurt for the state to prosecute.","answer":"A person who commits one act of animal cruelty against each of ten dogs (Ace, Biscuit, Coco etc) could be prosecuted for ten charges (or 'counts') of animal cruelty. This is because each act is a distinct offence.(The person who commmits ten acts of animal cruelty against one dog, or five acts against two dogs, etc, could be prosecuted for ten counts of animal cruelty too.)That is not double jeopardy.  is a procedural defence to being tried for a second or subsequent time for a particular act. If a person was tried and acquitted of being cruel to Ace on a given occasion, generally they can't be tried again for being cruel to Ace on that occasion. They can be tried for another occasion of cruelty to Ace."}

Why is it that the CBP process did not resolve the matter in timely manner and was not resolved until media indicated  in the CBP inspection zone:I realized that the subject matter is politically charged, however, I would like to keep the politics out of the dialogue and focus on the legal questions of the case.  Obviously, I am not a lawyer and seek to understand the contours of law and its resulting process.  Update:  in CBP detention of unknown duration:Last week, a California congresswoman visiting the Border Patrol's  processing center in McAllen encountered a 13-year-old girl holding a  U.S. passport. The girl was waiting with her mother, who had allegedly  crossed the border illegally. After inquiries were made, the Border  Patrol released both.","answer":"  Did the citizen have the right to make a phone call after being detained?I  don't know the rights of those in civil immigration detention, but if he was accused of a crime I believe he did.  what prevents the indefinite detention of the citizen?CBP can detain people who are suspected of crimes.  They can also detain people in connection with civil violations of immigration status, but US citizens cannot commit violations of immigration status.  Of course, if CBP does not believe the claim of citizenship, they will treat the person as an alien who is therefore potentially subject to civil immigration detention.The constitution guarantees a right to a speedy trial.  That prevents (is supposed to prevent) indefinite detention of those suspected of crimes.  I do not know what procedural guarantees exist for aliens in civil detention to prevent indefinite detention, nor whether a claim of US citizenship would affect the procedure.  Absent any indication of a crime or violation, does CBP have the authority to detain a US citizen if presented with proper identification documentation (passport card, passport)?No.  Absent any indication of crime or violation, they can't detain anyone except under specific circumstances for a very limited period of time.  Specifically, they can stop people at Martinez Fuerte checkpoints, and they can stop people who are entering the country from foreign territory.  In both cases, they need justification to hold them for more than a few minutes.  What obligation does CBP have to process a detained US citizen in a timely manner?The same obligations that apply to anyone detained in connection with a crime, arising out of the speedy trial guarantee in the US constitution.  Does CBP \\ ICE have jurisdiction or authority to demand ID from citizens in a non-border or non-airport context?More or less.  If an officer charged with enforcing immigration law has reasonable suspicion that someone claiming to be a US citizen is not, the officer can ask the US citizen for evidence of citizenship.  If the US citizen does not provide it, the officer can detain the US citizen while investigating the claim of citizenship.  Remember, this is true only if there is a reasonable suspicion that the US citizen is lying.  Did the citizen do anything to warrant the detention?Probably not all 23 days.  It looks like someone is trying to cover something up since they claimed that he never said he was a US citizen even though they seem to have filed a complaint alleging that he presented a falsified US birth certificate.  Is there anything the citizen could have done at the checkpoint to avoid detention?It is hard to know without knowing more about what happened or definitely whether he was detained for civil immigration violations or for a crime.  If the former only, a US passport might have helped.  If the citizen refused to answer CBP questions, could this produce a better outcome?I don't see how it would have.  Once detained, what could the citizen do to reduce the detention duration?It sounds like not much in addition to what he did.  Getting before an immigration judge should have resulted in his release, but immigration judges are very overloaded these days, I believe.  What are the lessons learned for other citizens?It really seems to depend.  Don't hang out with your out-of-status brother might be one.  Get and carry a passport might be one.  Move north might be one.  For some people, none of those precautions would be necessary.  Why is it that the CBP process did not resolve the matter in timely manner and was not resolved until media indicated attention forced the issue?Your guess is as good as mine."}

{"question":"Under state law parents have a legal duty to among other things educate minor children until they graduate from high school or an approved equivalent. The state also provides for public schools which are mostly taxpayer funded (the final two years of my high school education would have cost my parents about $1,500 in unavoidable fees).Both of my parents signed nine legal documents that spelled out every party's responsibilities ad nauseam. My high school agreed to pay for 50 credit hours at a local college and accept those credits as the complete fulfillment of my high school graduation requirements.My guess is that the district received some manner of a discount. But were my parents to purchase this it would cost them about $47,000.My father is trying to abrogate the deal he signed -- so far he hasn't met with success because the paperwork itself clearly states that all of the signatories (me, Mom, Dad, my counselor, and the principal) must agree to and countersign any modification to the agreement.He states that since I am receiving the benefit, an education valued at about $47,000, and he \"could have\" satisfied the state's educational requirement in another way (sent me to a parochial school or laugh homeschooled me) the contract(s) he signed are invalid because the fact that he doesn't have to pay required text book fees, technology fees, lab fees, diploma and registration fees doesn't count as \"consideration\" so it isn't a binding contract.PS: My father is so smart that he felt no need to have a lawyer review anything before he signed it.","answer":"Contracts are routinely held to be valid even when there is negligible or literally zero financial gain (compensation, which they take into consideration in order to enter into the contract). A document purporting to be a contract might be held invalid if it is a bare promise like I promise to give you $100 on Friday, but you can make it an enforceable contract by including if you give me a french fry today. Reasoning that party could have done something else does not invalidate a contract, for example the party might have had $3 at the time and could have purchased a whole bag of fries. The only imaginable relevance of I could have thinking would be if the terms of the contract are so unclear that the party would not reasonably have understood the contract to have obligated them to pay $100, or that they would have reasonably believed that they were to receive a suitcase full of french fries.There is a (huge) difference between subjective errors in interpreting a contract and objective uncertainty. Objective uncertainty is fundamentally about the linguistic structure of the agreement, i.e. words like it which have no intrinsic referent, or required books and clothing (which could mean required books and all clothing, or required books and required clothing). There may be special rules of legal interpretation addressing how such ambiguities are resolved (this one is not well established, but is known in some spheres as the across-the-board rule). Personal interpretation does not enter into decisions as to the validity of a contract: if you misinterpret the words of a contract, regardless of how strong your proof is that at the time you did not understand the contract, that doesnt matter, unless you can show that at the time you were actually not competent (did not know Armenian and could not have understood what the contract required). The courts look at the words of the contract, assume that the parties have availed themselves of wise legal counsel, and understand how the courts would interpret the contract, then they filter the words of the contract through a sieve composed of rules constituting the law, and declare what parties A and B must do."}

What does the law say on this?","answer":"Does the doctrine of sovereign immunity extend to state officialsacting in their official capacities to serve the government? Or itdoesn't and people can sue officials and the representatives of thegovernment instead of suing the government itself?The law isn't entirely uniform but generally a government official (state or federal) acting in their official capacity is immune to suits for money damages, but not for suits for injunctive relief involving their official actions, or declaratory relief regarding rights they are charged with enforcing.The main exception is that government officials are liable for money damages for intentional violations of federal civil rights made under color of state law if the rights are well established. Governmental entities are liable for civil rights violations only if they are committed by government officials duty to a policy (whether or not officially adopted) of the employing government.There are some exceptions to sovereign immunity for official conduct, generally involving negligence in circumstances where private employees would also be liable (e.g. negligently driving a government car causing an accident).There is almost never sovereign immunity from contactual liability, but individual government officials are almost never parties to government contracts, and instead are disclosed agents of the government acting on its behalf to agree to a contract.State officials acting in their official capacity are also not immune from criminal liability under criminal laws related to misconduct by government officials, although the law expressly exempts from criminal liability many kinds of justified used of force by government officials."}

{"question":"Imagine that the police entered someone's home completely randomly without proper authorization and searched every corner of the house. By chance, they stumbled upon a murder scene. In this situation, would the evidence they collected be allowed to be used in court?Would the judicial system overlook the police's violation of protocol? Would they dismiss the entire case out of a strict adherence to proper procedure? Or would it be up to the discretion of whichever judge happened to be sitting on that day?","answer":"Without more information, and given your assertion that the entry was completely random[] (i.e. without determination that exigent circumstances required entry) and without a warrant, then this would be a Fourth Amendment violation of those that had a privacy interest in that home.Here's why:the home and the body are the areas in which a person has the greatest expectation of privacy (the Katz standard)entry into the home is also a trespass (which would make this a search under the Jones standard)people are protected from unreasonable searches and seizures; generally, this means that they must be supported by a warrant unless falling within an exception to the warrant requirement; in all cases the search must not be unreasonablegiven your assertion that the entry was completely random[] this would be the epitomy of an unreasonable searchAssuming that the person they would be charging had a privacy interest in that home (this is the critical assumption in my answer), and assuming the accused brings a motion to supress, the evidence would almost certainly be excluded at trial. In the circumstances you've described, and assuming no further circumstances relating to the evidence or how it might have been obtained, you have left no room for discretion. If the judge declined to exclude the evidence, it would be an error of law, and I have no problem predicting that any conviction relying on that evidence would be overturned on appeal.Whether the case can proceed without the evidence that was obtained as a result of the Fourth Amendment violation depends on the specifics of the case. Exclusion of evidence does not necessarily doom the prosecution to fail, but where critical evidence such as what you've described is excluded, this would likely be the end of the state's case."}

{"question":"Apparently the US has put Huawei on a trade blacklist that prevents US companies to trade with Huawei. With hardware and proprietary software it is straightforward how this can be executed (don't make any contracts, don't sell stuff\/licenses).With OSS this is a lot more complicated since there is no real deal or negotiation between the licensee and the provider of a license. Also, there is not a single copyright holder and copyright matters are often very complicated concerning OSS. So the question is twofold: does the trade blacklist have any effect on OSS and if not, is it at all possible for the US government to limit the trade of OSS?","answer":"Publishing source code is . Therefore the US government cannot stop anyone from publishing open source software, and once it is available from a web site it is impossible to stop anyone else getting it.However any kind of support contract () or other commercial arrangement would fall under the definition of 'trade' and be banned.Update in response to comments about ITAR.The USA International Traffic in Arms Regulations still . However any attempt to prosecute an open source project for publishing cryptographic software would run up against the First Amendment. In 2008 the 9th Circuit found that open source cryptographic software is covered under the First Amendment, and hence the use of ITAR to restrict its publication is unconstitutional.The US government declined to push this case to the Supreme Court, and no other similar cases have arisen since. In the meantime  has been made widely available from within the USA without US government permission (Linus Torvalds is resident in the US).In theory the US government might launch a case against an open source project, win the appeal in another circuit, and hence create a circuit split which the Supreme Court would have to resolve.

{"question":"This is a semi-ridiculous question from a law-ignorant but curious person.  My apartment prohibits tenants from having firearms on the property, by the lease.  in the United States, the 'right to bear arms' is a constitutional right.  (I understand there's disagreement about what that means, that things are more complicated than just that phrase, and etc.)  So, theoretically, can an apartment 'infringe' on other constitutional rights as well, such as freedom of speech, as long as it's in the lease, and the tenant signs?","answer":"Firstly, your 'apartment' doesn't prohibit anything; Your tenancy contract does. A terminology nitpick, but one that can shed some light on what is actually happening.TLDR: Your right to bear arms isn't being infringed, its being traded away. An unreasonable trade may be invalidated by the courts. Firearms restrictions are far less likely to be voided than speech content limitations.Yes, you have the right to bear arms(whatever exact meaning of that is). You also have the right to voluntarily agree to a binding agreement limiting that right, in exchange for a consideration.Compare a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). You have the right to freedom in your speech: you also have the right to agree to binding limits on your freedom of speech, in return for consideration (such as money or access to information).Every contract is structured in the same general way: Party A agrees to do or avoid doing certain things, in exchange for Party B agreeing to do or avoid doing certain things.So, in essence, what the apartment contract says is, that you agree to do or not do some things (including paying rent), in return for your landlord temporarily granting you some rights(such as the right to reside(generally exclusive), the right to control the space, etc. ), and imposing some obligations on themselves (which vary from place to place). In your case, one of the things that you are trading is a limitation on your right to bear arms(note that you can still bear arms, just not on the property in question).Now one thing to note is that courts have the power to enforce contracts; they also have the power to void contracts, in part or in full, if they are illegal or 'unconscionable'. In general, restricting (the content of) speech is not reasonable (e.g. having a general noise level restriction is reasonable), so is more likely to be struck down than one restricting firearms on the rented property."}

{"question":"I lost a pair of eyeglasses and contacted the store from which I bought them asking if they could sell me an identical replacement.

{"question":"The recent controversy over the Drejka shooting in Clearwater Florida, involves a shooter invoking 'stand your ground'.   As I understand the matter, LEOs (law enforcement officers) are forced to make a decision of whether or not to arrest and charge a shooter based on available evidence \\ testimony.  The Sheriff decided not to arrest the shooter.  I understand that burden of proof has been shifted to the state to prove that unreasonable force was exercised: is this true only in a court of law where the shooter has been charged, or is it also true in the course of LEO's evaluation of events to decide whether to  arrest and charge the shooter?  Put another way: Do LEOs need probable cause comprising a conclusion that unreasonable force was exercised to make an arrest \/ charge once 'stand your ground' is invoked?I realize that this is a highly charged topic and no inference should be drawn regarding my position regarding the matter.","answer":"So first things first, whether or not Stand Your Ground is in play, the burden of proof is always on the State to prove any crime did happen and any defense does not.Another thing that I think you confused in your question is it seems apparent that you think Stand Your Ground is Self Defense.  This is not true.In the United States, self-defense is always a legal right for a victim of a potential crime, regardless of if your state has Stand Your Ground or Duty to Flee laws.  Self-Defense typically can include justifiable homicide as you are not privy to the intent of the bad actor.Under Duty To Flee laws, you cannot claim self defense if you could reasonably get away from a criminal action safely... if given the choice between fight or flight, you must flee the scene.Stand Your Ground contradicts this and says that if you are in a public place and a criminal is trying to make you a victim, you have every right to defend yourself without any duty to remove yourself from the situation first... basically at this point, you can make either choice and not worry about losing justifiable Homicide.Making a criminal arrest of a Stand Your Ground claimant at the seen is not necessarily required.  While the claim may be disputed, in the case of firearms, using an illegally owned weapon is typically ground for arrest regardless... (probably not in cases where the illegal gun was introduced to the scene by the dead criminal... and the victim picked it up in a scuffle... though this requires some measure of sorting out).  Legal Fire Arms are very well documented and the fire arm in question will be confiscated as evidence.  If it is found that it was not a justifiable homicide, the person in question is probably at the address tied to the gun.Now, again, Stand Your Ground only applies to steps needed for Self-Defense, it is not self-defense itself.  Self-Defense authorizes only the amount of force needed to safely resolve the situation, up to and including leathal force, but it does not require you to kill the perpetrator in every instance it is invoked.  For example, if merely pointing a gun at a perpetrator is enough to stop the crime, you do not get to pull the trigger.  That flips it back into homicide.  Similarly, if I pull my gun and the guy advances anyway, I may fire and if the guy is on the ground and out cold (thus, no longer a threat), I don't get to walk up, and put a second bullet between his eyes, execution style.  This too is murder.As a bit of anecdotal evidence, when I was living in Florida, I worked for a man who just recently purchased a firearm for self-defense (in the home only) and he said that when he was filling out paperwork with the police, the cop looking over his paperwork said, 'Now remember, if you have to use that, shoot to kill.  It's less paperwork for us.'Now, I wasn't there when to cop said it, I don't know what his tone was.  I took it as the cop being a little funny, but maybe a little inappropriate.  I cannot speak to how much that is indicitive of FL Police culture.  It was hearsay on my part... I just thouht it was funny and... demonstrates the attitude towards self-defense.  Essentially, by the time cops arrive at the scene, they HARD PART is over... they merely have to collect evidence and take witness statements.  If the shooter is cooperating and his story checks out, it will look very bad if they detain a crime victim who defended himself.  It's just bad PR.  Ultimately, his job is to collect all evidence, not determine if the case should go to trial.  As I mentioned, the gun was legally owned in the specific case, and more than likely the CCTV tape is collected, but not yet viewed.  Hindsight may be 20\/20 but at the time, I do not think it's fair to say that the cop knew this might not be such a clear cut case.In such cases, the cop may not make an arrest because there is not any crime that he can charge the man with and he is cooperating.  And keep in mind that in the heat of the moment for the shooter, he may not even realize he did something that might break his self-defense case.Cops can detain a person claiming Stand Your Ground for just about any legitimate reason, even suspicion of homicide that the detainee will claim is self-defense."}
{"question":"If a restaurant normally accepts credit cards, and a customer eats a meal there, then tries to pay with his valid credit card, and the cashier says the credit card system is down and they can only accept cash today, and the customer has no cash, and no easy way to get cash, can the customer legally leave without ever paying? Does the restaurant have a simple and legal way to enforce the debt?Assume the restaurant displays signs that they accept credit cards, and gives no prior notice to the contrary. Also assume the restaurant's bank has just severed its relationship with the restaurant, so credit card payments in any form are not viable. ","answer":"There is no intention to commit theft, so there is no criminal act on the part of the customer.Even if there was a criminal act, the ability of the restaurant to detain the cusomer (citizen's arrest) is very limited in most jurisdictions. The restaurant can ask the customer for his name and address, but there is no legal obligation on the customer to provide this. Refusal to do so, however, might be evidence of intention to avoid paying and at that point the restaurant might call the police.The customer can leave, and the restaurant can pursue the debt through the civil courts if they have means to do so - they may have CCTV of the customer and his car registration which can be traced. Petrol stations, where people often fill up and then realise they can't pay, usually have established 'promise to pay' procedures where they take the customer's details and the customer has 48 hours to pay before police or civil enforcement action is taken.

{"question":"In an american MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) sanctioned match, one fighter executes a newly created technique, we'll call it the 'five-point palm exploding heart technique' upon their opponent.  Said opponent suffers the hit, takes a few steps, and drops dead immediately.  In this case, it is purposeful.  The fighter said they were going to do this prior to the match, describing their plan in great detail, and stated they knew it would result in certain death.  The skill difference is absolute, the round lasts 2 seconds.  He or she could've easily won any other way and they admit their actions were cruel and unnecessary.  Not only that but they take great pride in what they've done, bragging to the press and mocking the deceased.For the purposes of MMA, the hit abides by all rules and no presiding officials intervened.Is the surviving fighter protected from criminal and\/or civil liability?","answer":"I think the problem here, is that if the move is provably always fatal, it would not be legit (as this would open up the sports organization running the sanctioned match to all manner of legal issues).  So a move that is always fatal would be banned and not legal.  Rules generally exist to ensure that the competition is fair, or that the competitors are safe, or to prevent unsafe conditions from occurring.  (For example, in NFL Football, you are not allowed to pull on the face guard of another player as doing so could cause the mask to break and could expose the player to all manner of injury or other sanctions.  In most Tournament Trading Card games, you are not allowed to touch another players card without first asking for and receiving permission, because taking it from the field without stating intent could result in a physical conflict to occur in a game.).   Most rules do have a catch all to allow the scenario not thought of to be short circuited.  While there 'ain't no rule' that says a golden Retriever can't play Basketball\/Football\/Volleyball\/Organized Calvinball what have you, most high schools in the United States do require that the play of a team sport be a Student of the School they play for and maintain a GPA, qualifications that a Golden Retriever would almost always fail to meet).  A simple line about no moves which will reasonably cause lasting injury to the player would give the ref enough wiggle room to rule that a move that will knowingly kill a player would be illegal under this as death is a very well known lasting injury.That said, whether the ref uses a seeing eye dog or not, the call will likely not affect this as the scenario is definitely pre-meditated murder (1st Degree murder) and the evidence shows that you clearly wanted to kill someone.   The judge doesn't care if the tournament didn't declare it illegal, he'll leave the outcome to that decision the the civil court when the players association, and the decease's family sue them for the unsafe environment (and there are probably some regulatatory agencies that would like a word).Now, if the move was illegal, but the death was unintentional, it could be manslaughter if you actively sought to break the rules, knowing full well this would happen.   Many rules are written without the justification of the specific rule.  And this is actually a lot harder to prove, because we would need evidence that you planned to violate the rules (you could not intend to violate the rules... refs can call a foul on you for an accident because a game rule is not a law, and failing to follow it could result in a dangerous situation whether or not you intended to follow the rules) any crime of intent is hard to prove because you have to look for clues to actions that are premeditated in nature or require an action on your part (such as deflating footballs).   Because you created an unsafe condition by breaking a rule, the death from that injury may be Manslaughter if it can be proven that was intentional rule break, but your goal was not specifically to cause a death of another player.  If you break a rule, but had no intent to break the rule and another player dies, it could be an accident and you might not be liable.   This situation hinges on your intent to break a rule, which is hard to prove as the game does not care about your intent.  Intentional or otherwise, you will be issued a sanction to deter future actions from repeating.In the United States, there is a legal tradition of 'Felony Murder' which is the legal intention for the crime of someone unintentiolly dying while the defendant was committing a non-homicide based crime (I.E. you walk into a bank, pull a gun, fire it into the air, and yell 'Down on the Floor, this is a stick up.'  If during the stick up a little old lady who was patroning the bank has a heart attack, you will be charged with her murder even if you never shot your gun at a person.  The fact that your criminal action caused her to have a fatal heart attack is legally a foreseeable outcome of breaking the law, thus you can be held on a First Degree.  Similarly, there is Felony Manslaughter, which is the equivalent used for any case where the highest crime committed is a misdemenor offense (I.e. You're driving in excess of the speed limit sign and plow into a car, killing the drive.  Since speeding is the only crime committed, the the charge for the death is Felony Manslaughter.)."}

{"question":"First, I'll acknowledge that 'serious' is subjective, however there is (probably) consensus that sentences imposed are reflective of the seriousness of a crime.USAtoday (6-18-18) USA TODAY examined 2,598 written judgments in border-crossing cases filed in federal courts along the border since mid-May. In nearly 70 percent of those cases, migrants pleaded guilty and immediately received a sentence of time served, meaning they would spend no additional time in jail. Another 13 percent were sentenced to unsupervised probation, including a condition that they not illegally re-enter the United States. In both cases, that meant they would immediately be returned to immigration officials to be processed for deportation, leaving them in essentially the same position as if they had not been prosecuted.  So, was there any point (in 84% of these cases) to invest time and effort in a criminal referral and prosecution? Does that suggest that the judges don't think that a serious crime has been committed?  (Feel free to migrate to Politics if that seems to be the better place for this)","answer":"As you said, 'serious' is a subjective description of a crime, but most lawyers would probably have the same first reaction when asked to make the distinction: Is it a felony or a misdemeanor? Felonies are objectively more serious because they come with longer sentences, as well as a variety of awful collateral consequences -- lost voting rights, disqualification from gun ownership, etc.By that standard, unlawful entry into the United States () is not, in most cases, a serious crime. For a first offense, it's a misdemeanor punishable by at most six months in jail. For subsequent offenses, though, it's a felony punishable by up to two years.I'd agree that the sentences meted out suggest that the judges don't view this offense as a particularly serious one. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it was pointless to prosecute. For instance, the first prosecution enables a harsher sentence if the immigrant lands in front of the judge again, and I'd bet that a fair share of the harsher sentences involved repeat offenders. Also, if you think that being a nation of laws means that we should always enforce every law (or if you at least believe this when it comes to immigrants), then the prosecutions are their own reward."}
{"question":"I found this  for the US. That's all I have found for US stuff, is there any more to be found in terms of legal documents? Then the main part of the question is, what about finding this similar information for other legal systems around the world, is there any straightforward way to do that? Or must I go dig into each country's website and figure it out for each specific case, there is nothing centralized\/standard? has a statutes at large in text format starting it seems, but nothing in the US goes back to the 1700's in computer readable text format it seems, unless I missed it.","answer":"Nowhere CollectivelyThe US doesn't know the number of laws on all the federal, state, and city books. Often the lowest level of laws and ordinances are only in a city database, and sometimes not on the internet.As a result, there is already an impossibility to get all the laws in the US in one database - and there are even countries that have not taken any steps to make their laws accessible on the internet at all. For example North Korean Law.This is compounded by different entities proclaiming their laws and regulations in only their own language and on different proclamation platforms. Where available at all, the countries have country-wide laws and ordinances on their own dedicated websites. But again, federalism for the win: there will be different proclamation platforms for lower levels of legislation.For example Why a conglomerate is a bad ideaNow, making a conglomerate of all the laws is actually a bad idea for several reasons:Updates. The different entities that are in making regulations with the force of law only update their official proclamation site. Often, such changes are not announced too loudly for the lowest levels, and with the number of cities in a single federal state, it's near impossible to keep the database up to date on a complete level. This is why different databases usually only scrape the federal levels.Scraping will break quickly. Each of the websites I pointed to in Germany has a different system setup, making scraping these websites for the relevant information basically useless. Compounding that, City ordinance pages are redesigned at a somewhat elevated pace, resulting in the scraping of these pages to break quickly, even if you manage to set it up.Citability. In a court of law, only the official text is relevant. If an update is missed, then the whole text is useless - you'll have to look up the actual, currently in-force version of the law or ordinance, so the conglomerate is not helping.You want a ginormous database. In some countries, judgments also make law as precedent. So you want every judgment in your database. Which quickly runs into a different problem: "}
{"question":"With bans on gatherings due to the virus, can the government close churches or are they exempt due to seperation laws?","answer":"The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment requires government restrictions on churches to satisfy a compelling government interest, such as preventing massive deaths from disease. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from granting special privileges to a specific religion or to all religions (, 330 U.S. 1  government may not 'pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions or prefer one religion over another'). Exempting only religious gatherings (however defined) would be unconstitutional. Restricting all gatherings (including religious gatherings) would be constitutional (subject to the general restrictions being itself constitutional)."}
{"question":"Is it legal for an online service to charge an account holder credit card for services that are contingent on the account holder being able to manage their account if the account holder's access has been restricted?","answer":"Depends on what terms of service the account holder signed up to.For instance, one could run a website at a cloud provider, configure it so that it automatically scales up when the traffic grows, and then mishandle the credentials so that one cannot shut it down quickly. By the time access is restored, there might be quite some bill.As it recently made the news, when a business deliberately makes it easier to sign up than to cancel, the  may step in. But that was an extreme case."}
{"question":"We live in a three-unit condo, with three trustees (one per unit) who act by majority vote. We're interested in adding a second bathroom to ours  by converting an existing small room rather than building or taking common area. Even though we're not changing the footprint, this is an improvement which affects the common areas (because of the plumbing) and therefore needs trustee approval. We have that, with a 2-1 vote. But, the people voting no are saying that since there is a page in the condo docs which describes the number of rooms and notes on a chart '1B', where B is bathroom, that the project requires an amendment to this part of the Master Deed to change this and cannot go forward without.Is this true? Is this chart a prescription, or is it intended to describe the condo at formation and should be changed to follow reality but does not block it? Or, something else?","answer":"So, likely descriptive but may be either depending on how the deed is drafted, and depending on whether it's in an exhibit that is incorporated by reference into the deed or not. However, what likely governs is not the description\/prescription in any event; it is whether your deed allows for an easement and the board has approved it. Most master deeds for condominiums have what is called an 'Easement of Encroachment' in the body of deed (usually shortly after the name, description of land, description of building, description of unit(s)), so that each unit has the benefit of an easement of encroachment in the event that said unit (meaning any unit) encroaches upon any portion of the common elements of the structure or another unit (encroachment on another unit is only for things like building settling that causes the building lines to move or change slightly &ndash; you can't bump out your closet a foot into your neighbor's room). This easement goes both ways, or vice versa, such that common elements may encroach upon the unit for a variety of different reasons like building maintenance and building settling; i.e., the whole has the same rights.The part that is really relevant in your case, however, and is very typical language, is the part that typically states something like: each unit has and is subject to an easement for the benefit of any other unit, to use and access such elements to encompass wires, ducts, pipes, conduits, cables or any other common elements located in, on, or within the right of any unit such that if improvements to a unit that are within your right under the restrictive covenants (the vote would decide that in your case) then those common elements may be changed to the extent that they do not materially and adversely affect another unit. This does not mean that another unit does not like it. It means that it would materially change their unit in some way, like the shape of it, the water available to them, etc. You should check the master deed for this. Otherwise, the covenants control and you still should have the right to do this.  You may potentially just need to amend the description of your unit. Even if an amendment needs to get filed with the registry of deeds, that is not a big deal. I hope this helps."}
{"question":"Based on my patent search, I don't think there is any existing patent that would cover the device I want to create and sell.But if I am mistaken, and I make a business selling my device, what is the worst case scenario?For example, I get a cease and desist, have to stop my business but keep my profits?Or can a patent-holder sue me?If so, can I be made to hand over my profits from my business leading up to that point?Or worse, can I be made to pay even more, like for the patent-holder's other losses?","answer":"It's a fact that anyone can sue anyone in civil court for anything, including patents and Intellectual Property rights.Have you read about Patent Trolls? See .You could possibly be sued for patent infringement even after being granted a patent for your own invention, because the judgement whether a patent is sufficiently unique and different from any other given patent and can be subjective at times. That's the wiggle room the patent trolls use to sue. They go to court in an attempt to convince the court that the patent office erred and they deserve damages for infringing on their patent and profits. And the court could rule on damages or court costs, and possibly to relinquish profits or pay for losses that a third-party suffers.Specific legal advice is off-topic on Law SE. So the best thing to do is get real legal advice about the patent process and prior art searches, and, after your patent is granted, what you may have to deal with if you get a C&amp;D letter or are taken to court for infringement."}
{"question":"I am wondering if Good Samaritan laws protect a person from being charged with murder if they kill a person who had been violently attacking a police officer.For example, say that a person is walking down a street and he\/she comes upon a person who is violently attacking a police officer who is lying on the ground and looks to be in physical distress.If he\/she then comes up behind the attacker and then puts that attacker into a choke hold, and then the attacker ends up dying from being put into a choke hold, will a Good Samaritan law keep that person from being charged with the murder of the attacker?","answer":"Good Samaritan laws are not applicable to the factsGood Samaritan laws give a person civil immunity if they render aid in good faith and that aid turns out to do harm. For example, in a person incorrectly performs CPR in a genuine effort to save a life, Good Samaritan laws prevent them for being sued if the cause damage or fail to save the life.The legal paradigm in your facts is self-defenceThe doctrine of self-defence extends to the protection of others and allows the use of reasonable force to do so. If a jury considers that the choke hold was a reasonable response to the situation and the maintenance of it to the point of death was also reasonable then the defendant will be not guilty.There would be a lot of evidence around this and its difficult to see how this would go. However, for a more straightforward situation, if the defendant verbally challenged the attacker, the attacker persisted in the attack, the defendant struck the attacker, the attacker fell and cracked their skull and died, this is likely to be self-defence.Self-defence does not prevent prosecution. It is a defence that can be raised. Of course, if it seems likely that self-defence will succeed, that may be enough to dissuade the police\/prosecutor from proceeding anyway."}

{"question":"In a recent  in Florida, a police officer was fired due to accusations of sexual assault. In an interview, the chief of police said that the officer would not be charged, because there was \"a preponderence of evidence, but not probable cause.\"I see that preponderence of evidence is defined as \"greater than 50% chance that the claim is true\" (or \"more likely than not\"). It's frequently brought up as a less rigorous standard than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.However, just from the language, I would think that probable cause would be less rigorous than a preponderence of evidence. This intuition seems to be corroborated by  article from Duke:Preponderance of the evidence requires a finding of more likely than not, whereas probable cause is a lower standard that requires reasonable grounds to believe.How can one have a preponderence of evidence, but not probable cause?","answer":"The quote seems to come from  provide ample verbiage regarding the rules, regulations, investigation and findings by the police department.It seems most likely that Chief Bogart was using words loosely. While police officers definitely have to understand what probable cause is (they arrest people if they have it), preponderance of evidence is a concept relevant to civil trials, thus not in the bailiwick of the police, so this could have just been informal talking. Nevertheless, a less abbreviated statement makes clear what the difference is  we found a preponderance of evidence to support termination of his employment contract, but not probable cause of a crime to support an arrest."}

Can they really deny me water and force me to pay this?","answer":"Water charges are the responsibility of the person who has the contract with the water utility.However, if they are unpaid, they become a lien over the property irrespective of who owns it. In fact, they usually have the right to seize the property and sell it to recover their money.

{"question":"This question was prompted by , in which a person described the dilemma they faced on discovering illegal material had been stored by an unidentified third party on their computer system:He called the police, who told him to print it out and bring it to them. However it is illegal to possess images of child abuse, digitally or in print.The crime is based on knowing possession, so once a person knows their computer contains such content, and decides not to delete it (or not delete it yet), they probably fall within the law.So this made me think. If someone does find illegal material, what can they do?Even to keep it long enough for police to be notified and attend would still be keeping\/possessing it.Knowing it's been stored in various backups might mean having to destroy important backups, as some of the most widely used backup and snapshotting systems don't have selective delete capability, you can only keep or delete the entire backup. (ZFS especially, widely used in many file servers for its utter reliability, is designed this way to preserve snapshot integrity: you can delete snapshots but not specific files in them).Copying to a device such as a USB stick, even by or with police, may be a concern since in law, this creates a copy on the PC in order to copy it from server to USB stick.I'm in the UK but interested in other jurisdictions as well. Clearly if you do something like any of these under direction of the police, who you promptly notified, it's not likely you'll be prosecuted, but it would make me (and perhaps many people) very uneasy even so, because it is against the law and there isn't any legal exception created for good cause or \"because police told me to\".Also I can imagine in a worst case scenario, a bad file could have been there for months before coming to light, so copies may exist on effectively all data backups that exist - every company backup, and all of them immutable and critical.So... What exactly is the position, and the appropriate action, and what is the position with critical backups that can't be modified by their nature?","answer":"So far as I am aware, all jurisdictions provide some kind of defence to the offence of possessing child pornography (or, for that matter, other illegal items like drugs and weapons) for legal purposes. This is necessary at least for police and others involved in the criminal justice system  if not, it would be difficult to seize the material and admit it in evidence if the defendant pleads not guilty.In the United Kingdom, it is a defence to prove that you possessed the material for a legitimate reason, which is not defined. Note that this is a legal burden, meaning that the defendant must affirmatively prove the existence of a legitimate reason on the balance of probabilities, rather than merely raising reasonable doubt. See the , under the Statutory Defences section:The defence is made out if the defendant proves that he had a legitimate reason for the conduct in question. This is a legal rather than an evidential burden (R v Collier [2005] 1 Cr. App. R. 9).Legitimate reason is not defined in either Act. In Atkins v DPP; Goodland v DPP [2000] 2 Cr. App. R. 248 it was held that it is a pure question of fact in each case. In cases where it was maintained that the conduct was part of legitimate research, the central question will be whether the defendant was essentially a person with an unhealthy interest in indecent images acting under the pretence of undertaking research or, on the other hand, was a genuine researcher who had no alternative but to have such unpleasant material in his possession. The judgment continued to say that the courts are plainly entitled to bring a measure of scepticism to bear upon such an enquiry; they should not too readily accept that the defence is made out.Relevant statutory provisionsThe legitimate reason defence is set out in  has a section on Which Offence Should be Charged for more on this.In response to the comment below, ."}

The underlying theory behind the claim (advocated by some Georgia attorneys) is that a person may be open to aconspiracy charge for taking a woman to another state to get an abortion, which would be a crime if committed in Georgia. If a conspiracy exists in Georgia to do something illegal (in Georgia), that is a violation of OCGA , where a Georgia resident can be prosecuted in Georgia for a legal act carried out in another state, so this theory is a bit of a stretch."}

Your proposed uses are probably not: the purpose isnt legitimate because its a pretence, the use isnt transformative, the entire work is being copied, and it will have a deleterious effect on the primary market.

No law forces a government to engage in a discretionary act in the face of threats of violence, nor do laws prohibit such decisions.

They are generally written to anticipate circumstances surrounding natural disasters, uprisings and invasions, and disease outbreaks, and empower the executive to issue whatever orders are deemed necessary for public health and safety. They can differ a lot in how specific they are.There are a few rights that are expressly spelled out in the Bill of Rights (freedom of speech, right to bear arms, quartering soldiers etc.) which constitute a bright line that cannot be crossed. There is no explicit constitutional provision that protects your right to contract, but it was generally held that there are other rights that are implicit in the Constitution, or that follow from other provisions (until the court decided otherwise). Even though there is no express constitutional provision guaranteeing that you have the right to walk around in public peacefully minding your own business, this is generally held to be a fundamental right. The Supreme Court then may at some point identify a fundamental right, as they have done (the rights to marry, vote, procreate or use contraceptives...).The government cannot infringe on fundamental rights unless they do so to achieve a compelling government interest (public health and safety is a good example), and then the question is whether an infringement is properly justified. For that to happen, the law has to be narrowly tailored to the purported purpose, and be the least restrictive way of achieving that end. As for mandatory face masks, there is a potential equal protection argument related to the fact that it may be illegal to wear face masks in public. Some of the arguments set forth relate to the disproportionate impact upon the poor or the disabled (if they cannot wear a mask for compelling reason). It imposes an extreme burden on the poor and especially the homeless (I'm not one, and I cannot get a face mask in the store. 'Order it on Amazon' isn't an answer for many people). So mandatory (public) masks significantly infringes the right of people to live (buy food), and does so unequally.Whether or not such considerations are upheld to the highest courts remains to be seen."}
{"question":"I was in a restaurant in New Jersey (USA) recently and witnessed the owners telling a (possibly) homeless person that he couldn't come inside because he smelled too bad. Is this legal?More generally, are restaurants and other stores allowed to refuse entry to people for 'looking homeless'? I often wonder about this in NYC, where I can imagine store owners wanting to create a 'high-class' atmosphere in their store, but at the same time facing possible discrimination laws (and of course ethical issues).","answer":"Anti-discrimination laws apply to certain protected classes only. Homelessness (real or assumed) is not one of them, so it is perfectly legal to bar such people from your premises. It is also perfectly legal to bar people with red hair (assuming this is not indirect discrimination against certain racial groups). Nobody is required to serve everybody who comes in; what you are not allowed to do is ban women, homosexuals or other groups set out in the applicable statutes."}

{"question":"What amount of physical force, if any, can be used to prevent animal abuse (a dog's owner hitting the dog, with a minor present) in Oregon? Is it legal to restrain the owner? Take the dog to a safe area?","answer":"If someone attacks your dog, or the dog of a third person, you may use force to defend property rights, see . Assuming that the abuse is less than causing death, for first degree animal abuse, it is when one causes serious physical injury to an animal. The child actually becomes relevant because the misdemeanor becomes a felony whenThe person knowingly commits the animal abuse in the immediatepresence of a minor child. For purposes of this paragraph, a minorchild is in the immediate presence of animal abuse if the abuse isseen or directly perceived in any other manner by the minor child.So in fact, no amount of force can legally be used to prevent a person from hitting their dog. Force can be used to arrest a person (which prevents any further beating), if the person causes serious physical injury to the dog."}

How do I get approval?","answer":"There is something wrong-sounding about that claim. Owning a thing (such as a book) means that you can dispose of it however you want. If it is a physical book, then unless this is a book of top secret classified information, the US government has no control over the item, nor does the copyright holder have any right to prevent you from giving away your copy. Electronic books, however, are another matter, since often you don't buy such books, you buy a license to use the book (like a software license). The license terms of an electronic book could be subject to various controls, and the license might be non-transferable. The underlying logic of this is that under the doctrine of first sale, you are allowed to do whatever you want with intellectual property that you buy, and therefore to restrict re-distribution of electronic IP, software especially is typically not itself sold, and just the permission to use it is.If this is an electronic book, the copyright holder would be able (though not necessarily willing) to permit you to transfer your copy to someone else. Of course you can't give a copy to two people unless you have two licenses."}

","answer":"Under 42 USC section 12102 disabilityis defiend as:(1) Disability. The term disability means, with respect to an individual<br \/>(1) (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major lifeactivities of such individual;<br \/>(1) (B) a record of such an impairment; or<br \/>(1) (C) being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3)).This is qualified by section 12102(3)(A) which reads:(3) Regarded as having such an impairment. For purposes of paragraph (1)(C):<br \/>(3)(A) An individual meets the requirement of being regarded as having such animpairment if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an actionprohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mentalimpairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.Subsection (4)(A) provides that:(A) The definition of disability in this chapter shall be construed in favor of broad coverageof individuals under this chapter, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of thischapter.The ADA Amendments Act of 2008, (Pub. L. 110-325), listed among its official purposes in section 2:(b) (3) to reject the Supreme Courts reasoning in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471(1999) with regard to coverage under the third prong of the definition of disability and toreinstate the reasoning of the Supreme Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline,480 U.S. 273 (1987) which set forth a broad view of the third prong of the definition ofhandicap under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973;(b) (4) to reject the standards enunciated by the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing,Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that the terms substantially and major inthe definition of disability under the ADA need to be interpreted strictly to create a demandingstandard for qualifying as disabled, and that to be substantially limited in performing a majorlife activity under the ADA an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severelyrestricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most peoplesdaily lives;(b) (5) to convey congressional intent that the standard created by the Supreme Court in the caseof Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) forsubstantially limits, and applied by lower courts in numerous decisions, has created aninappropriately high level of limitation necessary to obtain coverage under the ADA, to conveythat it is the intent of Congress that the primary object of attention in cases brought under theADA should be whether entities covered under the ADA have complied with their obligations,and to convey that the question of whether an individuals impairment is a disability under theADA should not demand extensive analysis;Under these provisions the definition of a disability is to be 'broad and evidence that it does in fact limit major life activities, or has been regarded as a disability, or has been the occasion of discrimination, will normally be enough to have the condition treated as a disability under the ADA.In an article  from Lexis\/Nexis the authors mention the case of Barbara Joy McElmurryBarbara Joy McElmurry, 4'10 tall, worked for the Arizona Department of Agriculture as a lab technician fighting the Asian citrus psyllid. Her job consisted of screening traps set by her co-workers in the field. Over time, tension developed between McElmurry and her supervisor, Mary Garman. After McElmurry threatened to file harassment charges against Garman, the supervisor accused her of sabotaging lab results and demoted her to field work. McElmurry demurred, protesting that at 4'10 she was too short to drive the vehicles necessary to do field work. Garman, however, forced the demotion. Ultimately, McElmurry was injured in the field, and Garman terminated her....The district court refused to dismiss the disability discrimination claim, concluding that McElmurry had stated enough in her complaint for her disability discrimination claim to proceed to discovery:McElmurry, however, has alleged that her height is outside the normal range. She stands around 4'10. The Department has claimed that height can never be a disability\u2026. The Court is unable to make such a conclusion on the very limited record before it on this Motion to Dismiss. It is plausible that short stature could, in some contexts, substantially limit[ ] one or more of the major life activities of an individual.The article goes on to say:Typically, height is not a disability protected by the ADA. As this case illustrates, however, the ADA (as amended in 2009) is now sufficiently broad such that an employee can plausibly argue that a host of normal physical characteristics can become protected disabilities if they fall outside the normal range.In  by Isaac B. Rosenberg (2009). published by W&amp;M Law Student Publications, [footnotes shown here in {braces} when not omitted] the author writes:[Pages 927-8] Height-based discrimination claims may also prove viable under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).159 The ADA generally prohibits discrimination because of ones disability. Just like Title VII plaintiffs, anADA plaintiff must first make out a prima facie case under either a disparate treatment theory or a disparate impact theory.{See Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 49 n.3 (2003) (observing that the courts of appeals have applied the McDonnell Douglas framework in ADA cases)} Under either theory, however, the first and typically fatal hurdle has been establishing ones disability. {Sullivan, supra note 146, at 942 &amp; n.123 (discussing a 2003 study that found only 2 percent of ADA cases were won by employee plaintiffs and that barely half made it to consideration on their merits); see generally ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325 \u00a7\u00a7 2(a), (b), 122 Stat. 3553, 3554 (2008) [hereinafter ADAAA] (expressingdismay that Supreme Court decisions construed the ADA too narrowly thereby eliminating protection for many individuals whom Congress intended to protect).}}The ADA defines disability, in part, as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual or being regarded as having such an impairment.This section examines how short stature fits (or does not fit) within each of these definitions. The first part looks at height-based claims under an actual impairment theory. Although most courts have wholly rejected actual impairment claims premised on short stature, a fresh look at the regulatory scheme in light of the ADA Amendments Act of2008 (ADAAA) suggests that such claims may have merit after all. The second part considers height-based claims under the regarded as prong. Althoughregarded as claims premised on height have largely failed, such claims may prove increasingly viable after the enactment of the ADAAA....The EEOC has further clarified that impairment does not include physical characteristics such as eye color, hair color, left-handedness, or height, weight or muscle tone that are within normal range and are not the result of a physiological disorder.{29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App. \u00a7 1630.2(h) (2008)} A plain reading of this language would suggest that thedefinition of physical impairment includes either (1) a normal deviation in height that is the product of a physiological disorder, or (2) an extreme deviation in height that may or may not be caused by a physiological disorder.{See EEOC Interpretive Manual, supra note 91, \u00a7 902.2(c)(5) ([N]ormaldeviations in height, weight, or strength that are not the result of a physiological disorder are not impairments. . . . At extremes, however, such deviations may constitute impairments.}...[Page 930] In Mehr v. Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide, Inc., {81 72 F. Appx. 276 (6th Cir. 2003).} for example, the 410 female plaintiff filed EEOC charges alleging, inter alia, discrimination for being short. She later recharacterized her action as an ADA claim, asserting short stature as an impairment. The Sixth Circuit denied her claim as meritless because it interpreted the regulations as excluding from the definition of impairment all physical characteristics that are not the result of a physiological disorder....... Despite the regulations plain language, andnotwithstanding the EEOCs recognition that [a]t extremes . . . deviations [in height] may constitute impairments,190{EEOC Interpretive Manual, supra note 91, \u00a7 902.2(c)(5).} federal courts have not considered this [normal limits] theory in deciding height-based claims under the ADA.The article goes on to discuss how such claims may be more successful under the ADA's 2008 amendments, but does not list any cases in which such claims have been sustained. The amendments were very recent when this article was published, and few if any such cases had yet been brought under the amended ADA."}
{"question":"DC Statehood has been in the news recently, and I'm wondering about the logistics of it. First, take this excerpt from Article IV Section 3 of the Constitution:New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress.Although I would imagine DC is not considered to be under the jurisdiction of Maryland or Virginia, it seems to be at the junction of the two states, right? Also, how would we define \"part?\" Is DC a \"part\" of Maryland? So would DC statehood technically require approval from the Maryland and Virginia state legislatures?Now, here's an excerpt from Article I Section 8The Congress shall have Power To\u2026 exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such Dis-trict (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Con-gress, become the Seat of the Gov-ernment of the United States\u2026Giving Congress the power to \"exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatshoever, over such District\" seems pretty mutually exclusive with statehood. Would the Constitution need to be amended for DC statehood?","answer":"Probably notMaryland gave consent by ceding the land that became DC back when DC was first formed. Virginia had originally ceded a matching piece of land, which would have made the district a neat square 10 miles by 10 miles. Decades later, the Virginia General Assembly voted (in February 1846) to request the return of Alexandria in a process known as retrocession. On July 9, 1846, Congress voted to return all the area that had been ceded by Virginia. Since then, the district has consisted only of the land originally ceded by Maryland.When Article IV Section 3 says by the junction of two or more states, or parts of states it means by joining two states into one new one, or by cutting off parts of two of more states and making them a state -- doing either of those requires the consent of the states involved, but not an amendment.Article I Section 8 could be satisfied by creating a smaller district, perhaps just the Mall and the public buildings surrounding it, including the White House and the Capitol, but no residential areas. In any case nothing in Article I Section 8 mandates the creation or retention of a Federal district.It could be argued that making DC a state would require the consent of Maryland, which once included that land. Or it could be argued that Maryland's original cession left it with no further authority over that land (I favor the latter view). But no consent of Virginia would be needed, because none of its original land is included in the current district.In any case, Article IV Section 3 seems to give Congress this power, with no need for an amendment, only possibly for Maryland approval. So it appears that the primary body that would have to approve statehood for DC would be Congress. Whether approval from Maryland would also be needed is unclear -- probably not. No other body would need to approve.However, there is no case law on the matter, and such a move might well be challenged by those who would not want DC to elect two senators."}

Admissibility is very case-specific, but I can't think of anything that would allow you to keep them out of evidence.

{"question":" question was asked on the financial stack exchange.  The basic premise is that someone is giving another individual 'their' account number and telling the individual to take money out of it to pay his bills.What most likely is happening is the individual giving the account number is giving someone else's account (which they stole) to the man, and will later ask the may to send back some of the money due to some made up excuse for needing to pay some emergency, thus the man is the one that takes money that isn't his (and will be forced to pay it back), while the fraudulent individual gets the man's money 'clean' that they can keep.If I was in this situation my instinct would be to take the account information, then contact the bank in question and inform them that I suspect the account may be compromised, so they can contact the actual owner and arrange to change the account number to prevent the fraudulent individual from getting money out of the account.I'm wondering if one was to do this would they be opening themselves up to potential legal trouble, perhaps for having access to another individuals account number when the owner of the account didn't intentionally give it to you?

{"question":" in its present form states If Donald Trump were impeached and blocked from running again (which is one of the things that impeachment can do, disqualify from office)...Is that true?Does impeachment by the House of Representatives, with or without subsequent removal from office by the Senate, actually disqualify one from being re-elected to the same Presidential office? Before the present time, this might have seemed politically impossible regardless of the law, but impeachment and even removal from office does not seem as likely to hinder the viability of a candidate supported by the base of voters supporting the current US President.  This question is intentionally on Law.SE instead of Politics.SE as the focus is intended to be on law rather than political viability.As an example of a similar case, consider Roy Moore, who in 2001 was elected as Alabama's 27th Chief Justice, removed from office in 2003, was again elected chief justice in 2013, again forced out, then won a Republican primary for Senate in a heavily Republican state, earning Trump's endorsement, and is again a candidate for the US Senate.  As a closely related question, does impeachment by the House of Representatives, with or without subsequent removal from office by the Senate, actually disqualify one from being re-appointed as Vice President or elsewhere early in the line of succession, and re-reaching the same Presidential office by resignations or otherwise? ","answer":"Impeachment of a president does not on conviction automatically disqualify the convicted party from becoming president again.  However, after conviction, the Senate can vote to add to the punishment of removal from office 'disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.'  This requires only .  Does impeachment by the House of Representatives, with or without subsequent removal from office by the Senate, actually disqualify one from being re-elected to the same Presidential office?See above.  It requires impeachment by the House, conviction by the Senate, and a separate vote by the Senate to impose the punishment of disqualification.It's conceivable that the Senate could disqualify the convicted party only from becoming president, though it looks like in the two prior instances where this punishment was imposed it was the broader disqualification.  But if a person disqualified only from being president is in an office that would normally be in the line of succession, that person is simply omitted from the line of succession.  This happens routinely with naturalized citizens, and there's no reason to think it would be any different for a former president who had been disqualified only from the office of the president after being convicted on articles of impeachment."}

What trouble will someone be in if they break that rule, either on accident or purposely?","answer":"The donor will not be in trouble (see below), the campaign would be if they accepted more than permitted.In the past some campaigns have had to refund excessive individual contributions, and frankly it is easier just not accept donations that exceed the limit than to have to handle all the refunding process. So, many campaigns in the past have (particularly with online donations) won't process donations that are in excess.RE: in trouble - While a donation that exceeds the limit is technically a violation of 52 USC 30116, actual prosecution of a donor under that statute almost never happens except where the donation is grossly excessive. (10$ over the limit is excusable, whereas $1 million is obviously excessive) Federal Statues have any number of examples where an action maybe a technical violation but there are literally no actual repercussions (aka in trouble) for violations. Take for example misstating (lying about) a persons age on the US Census - clearly a violation of 13 USC sec 221, but actually not likely to be prosecuted.

I think I've heard a couple of stories about people who put a clause like that on their contact page, sent the invoice and had the company pay the invoice.

In order for there to be a contract, there has to be actual acceptance of the offer. You can put out on a web page some contract stating those terms, and if you get positive acceptance of the contract (hence the standard click-through technology), then as long as you have done the thing promised, you can bill them for doing the thing promised.It's not clear what thing of value you are offering on the web page, since it's not doing actual work. Them sending you an email isn't you doing something. One thing you could do is block all incoming emails, and for money you agree to unblock emails from registered subscribers.Just announcing that you will bill anyone for emailing you does not create a contract, because the emailer need not have even seen your announcement. This is why e-contracts need a click-through button. It's legal to request money, but there is no legal obligation for them to comply. That will be $10, please."}

{"question":"Suppose a person A is building a new dwelling.  In order to receive a certificate of occupancy from my municipality A needs to meet building code requirements - A needs to have a bathroom sink installed, a wall heater installed, and gutters placed on the house to meet these requirements.  In all three cases A has provided deposits to the contractor C for the purchase of products or the scheduling of gutters.  Both the sink and heater are 'on back order' with no definitive delivery times given. The gutter company has failed to provide a time and date for the gutter installation at all.  How long does A  have to wait before A can ask for the deposits back and find alternatives for these products and services?  Assume that A lives in Washington State in the USA.","answer":"The agreement between A and C should specify a due date for the job to be completed. If it does not, the standard is that it must be done within a reasonable time which depends on the nature of the job and local circumstances (such as supply of labor and materiel).The gutter company must deliver within the tiem it agreed to, or notify if that tiem cannot be met. If no time was specified in the agreement, US federal law says it must deliver of notify within 30 days, and give a chance to cancel if the original deadline cannot be met. If it is well past the agreed or default time, the customer may notify the supplier to cancel the order, and the supplier must provide a full refund. Similar rules will apply to the other suppliers.C is not responsible for the delivery problems of the suppliers, unless they work for C, which is unlikely. C is responsible for doing work in a timely fashion once supplies are available, and for giving A a best estimate of the completion fate under the current circumstances.Any specific dates in the agreement are binding, but will be modified if delays happen due to circumstances not under C's control despite C's best efforts."}
{"question":"What legal actions are available for a landlord who is trying to collect rent during the recent U.S. eviction moratorium?The eviction moratorium seems to challenge fundamental notions about property rights and ownership, so I'm curious if this sort of thing would be dealt with at the state or federal level and how so.If a tenant(s) cannot be evicted, and the mortgage is still due, is foreclosure the only option if the landlord has no other income?","answer":"Laws and regulations often limit or restrict remedies in various ways that may not be intuitive or correspond to popular ideas of legal rights.In the case of the recent , the obligation to pay rent was not changed. The only effect is that no action for eviction could be brought for a residential property during the effective period of the order, in situation to which the ordeer applied.The order says (see link above):This Order does not relieve any individual of any obligation to pay rent, make a housing payment, or comply with any other obligation that the individual may have under a tenancy, lease, or similar contract. Nothing in this Order precludes the charging or collecting of fees, penalties, or interest as a result of the failure to pay rent or other housing payment on a timely basis, under the terms of any applicable contract.To invoke the order a resident must sign a statement declaring under penalty of perjury that:I am unable to pay my full rent or make a full housing payment due to substantial loss of household income, loss of compensable hours of work or wages, lay-offs, or extraordinary?[38] out-of-pocket medical expenses;I am using best efforts to make timely partial payments that are as close to the full payment as the individual's circumstances may permit, taking into account other nondiscretionary expenses;If evicted I would likely become homeless, need to move into a homeless shelter, or need to move into a new residence shared by other people who live in close quarters because I have no other available housing options.as well as various other declarations.The order's justification section says in part:Evicted renters must move, which leads to multiple outcomes that increase the risk of COVID-19 spread. Specifically, many evicted renters move into close quarters in shared housing or other congregate settingsThe order later specifies that:This Order shall be enforced by Federal authorities and cooperating State and local authorities through the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3559, 3571; 42 U.S.C. 243, 268, 271; and 42 CFR 70.18. However, this Order has no effect on the contractual obligations of renters to pay rent and shall not preclude charging or collecting fees, penalties, or interest as a result of the failure to pay rent or other housing payment on a timely basis, under the terms of any applicable contract. ...While this order to prevent eviction is effectuated to protect the public health, the States and units of local government are reminded that the Federal Government has deployed unprecedented resources to address the pandemic, including housing assistance.It would seem that civil suits for payment of debts arising from unpaid rent are in no way prevented, only a remedy of eviction is blocked. That block would apply to any state or local courts, as well as any federal courts. Eviction cases are not normally brought in federal courts. But seizure of bank accounts or garnishment of wages could be obtained, if permitted by state law in a particular case. So might other remedies authorized by state or federal law."}
{"question":" on 13 March 2020, being interviewed about, among other things, 'Vexit', a plan proposed by some West Virginians and Virginians to have part of western Virginia leave and become part of West Virginia - go to 3:07 if the time link does not work, the first three minutes are not regarding Vexit.In this interview he claims Thomas Jefferson wrote the Virginia Constitution so that counties, communities, cities, could leave Virginia, go to another state, without a war, because he didn't want the Revolutionary War to have to happen again, for people to escape tyranny.Is there any truth to this claim?","answer":"Short answer:I don't know.  Some of the clauses in the US constitution make me think that unilateral secession from a state was not allowed in any state constitution in 1787.  Long Answer:Another factor to consider in relation to the transfer of counties from Virginia to West Virginia is Article Four, Section 3 of the United States Constitution adopted in 1788.  Section. 3.  New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.    The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.So the Federal Constitution of 1788 would seem to override the Virginia constitution of 1776.Note that Article Four, Section 2 says:  Section. 2.  The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.So if citizens of Virginia had the right to unilateral secesssion from Virginia, the citizens of every other state would have the right to unilateral secession from that state.And Article VI says:  This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.This indicates that if the Virginia constitution made unilateral secession from Virginia legal, Article Four, Section 3 would override it and make unilateral secession from Virginia unconstitutional. So if unilateral secession from Virginia (or any other state) was constitutional according to that state's constitution in 1787-1789, Article Four, Section 2 would make it constitutional in every other state, while Article Six and Article Four, Section 3 would forbid unilateral secession from any state.So I deduce that if the constitution of any state in 1787-89 made unilateral secession from that state legal, the United States Constitution that was written and adopted in 1787-1789 would have contained contradictory clauses.   I find it a little hard to believe that a bunch of politicians familiar with the constitutions of their respective states would have overlooked any contradictions in those articles in the US constitution they were writing.

{"question":"In Better Call Saul, Saul is upset that he's being paid \"per defense\" (1):Is this a common practice? Don't criminal cases vary significantly in complexity? How is this addressed with respect to public defender compensation?(1) as opposed to \"per defendant\", but that's besides the point.","answer":"The answer depends on the jurisdiction, the court, and how the public defender system is set up. This answer addresses state court indigent defense at the trial level.In many jurisdictions, state courts are organized by counties. In many of these counties, particularly larger and urban counties, public defenders are a department of county government (like the district attorneys who prosecute, or public works, or the tax assessor). These defenders are county employees, and paid a wage. They are not compensated by the case.In other jurisdictions, there may be no county-level public defenders. Courts there will appoint private attorneys to defend indigent defendants, and will compensate the defenders pursuant to a fee schedule promulgated by the court, or the judge's whim. The fee schedule may be time-based or flat fee, and usually provides differentials for type of case, amount of time required, investigative and witness fees, and often allows the lawyer to seek additional compensation if the lawyer thinks it's warranted. The court may decline the lawyer's motion, of course, at the risk that the lawyer won't take future appointments, a serious difficulty for the court which must, under the law, provide counsel for indigent defendants who face incarceration.More than this, it's tough to generalize. The setup in Los Angeles County, California, for instance, will be different than the experience in Alliance, NE, or a small county in another state.The same challenges face the federal courts. I'm only familiar with the California federal courts at the trial level, where a parallel system applies, with defenders on salary and employed by the federal government.While some states provide representation on appeal using defenders employed by the state government, other states rely on individual lawyers being appointed, rather like the trial-level system.Source: I'm a prior county public defender and private attorney in California."}

Most people have the right to enter their own country (except for practical problems, like not being able to prove you have the right) because you list your passport and\/or other ID). But it may be illegal to enter outside official border crossings, for example. Or illegal to enter without having the entry registered.

{"question":"I'm renting a room from a person, not a large organization; it's a monthly rental.  He claims he just saw I had missed my monthly rent payment from April of last year.  I don't have an easy way to check back more then a year ago to see if I made the payment.Now realistically I don't see this going to court one way or another; I have every intent to figure things out and if I really did miss a payment pay it now.  However it makes me curious what is the legal obligation in such a case?  Is my inability to definitively prove I gave him money a year ago make me responsible if he says he doesn't show the electronic payment on his end?  Or is there some sort of statue of limitations on his being able to claim a missed payment?I live in Maryland.","answer":"If you want to be argumentative about it, the burden of proof is on the person making the accusation. This also means the burden of production is, too. Underlying the whole matter is a claim that you've engaged in breach of contract, namely failing to pay rent. Your legal obligation is to not engage in contract fraud nor breach of contract. You are to exercise due diligence in resolving any breach of contract.You may ask the lessor to provide evidence in support of the claim while admitting that you have difficulty looking that far back into the issue. The idea here is to work with the lessor rather than immediately taking an adversarial stance. Normal people become very disgruntled by those taking an immediate adversarial approach rather than seeking to work with the other person to resolve the dispute."}

{"question":"Warning: spoilers for the TV show Designated Survivor ahead.The American TV drama Designated Survivor is set in a hypothetical world where terrorists have successfully attacked the State of the Union address and killed nearly all of the senior members of the US government. Many early episodes have plot points centering around Constitutional issues and Presidential powers that Americans will remember from their school days (e.g. the ability of the President to federalize units of the National Guard). Based on those early episodes, it's clear the show is attempting to be accurate in its depiction of existing US law, and not just making stuff up wildly or in an alternate reality with different laws.In S1E11 of the show, police officers have surrounded a building where they believe a terrorist is hiding. They are on US soil, and believe that the occupant of the building is the person who attempted to assassinate the president several hours earlier. It is unclear if they know the nationality\/citizenship status of the terrorist.The (Acting) President of the United States has an open line of communication to the on-scene police commander from a bunker in the White House. Other characters explain that standard procedure is for police to attempt to take the alleged terrorist into custody so that criminal charges may be brought, and for police to not fire their weapons unless attacked. The President gives a preemptive order for police to kill the suspect even if a non-lethal option is available. His advisors object, but he overrules them, explicitly commanding them to 'shoot to kill.'The show set things up to feel sort of like a Commander-in-Chief giving orders to a military unit in a war zone overseas, but ultimately, the scenario was a domestic police operation. So, is this something a President can actually do, from a legal standpoint? Or did the show decide to ignore reality in the service of the plot this time?","answer":"The show ignored the existing legal framework.Almost all U.S. police officers are employed by state and local governments and do not report directly to the President, even in an emergency. A small number of law enforcement officers are federal employees with a direct line of command to the President (e.g. the Secret Service and the security guards in the General Services Administration and TSA officers), but a law enforcement officer, unlike a member of the military or a CIA officer, does not simply follow the orders of the civilians to whom his superiors are responsible without the intervention of their law enforcement superiors based solely upon that civilian's whims and directions the way that a soldier would.The Secret Service has some limited authority to direct and even deputize local law enforcement officers in pursuit of their missions, but that would probably not extend to the kind of national security kill order contemplated in this episode.This said, lots of law enforcement officers are ex-military, most law enforcement agencies has a quasi-military organizational structure, and in the extreme circumstances of Designated Survivor, it wouldn't be shocking for law enforcement officers to follow their natural military chain of command intuitions rather than the law that actually applies in these situations. Law enforcement officers are personality types that are very deferential to authority which is a natural counterpart to support for their hierarchical view of the world that endows them with their own authority. There is no one in the loop to play devil's advocate for the suspected terrorist.But, strictly speaking, the proper protocol within the U.S. would be to have a CIA agent make the strike (because the military is prevented by the posse comitatus act from doing so, unless these events counted as an 'insurrection' which they very well might in which case the military could be involved), rather than a law enforcement officer.Incidentally, the U.S. Supreme Court has basically held that the citizenship of the suspected terrorist is irrelevant, even though policy makers in all of the Presidential administrations since 9-11 have not been very comfortable with that state of the law and have sought to distinguish U.S. citizens from non-U.S. citizens in their own policies."}

Both of their names are on the title and registration. She has done nothing but make tiny baby steps towards refinancing so his name is off the title and loan.  He  tried sending a power of attorney so that she can do anything she needs to, but apparently California doesn't accept them?Is there any way he can get a lawyer involved to force her to get this done?","answer":"A Cannot Compel B to RefinanceA cannot force B to refinance at all any more than he could force her to return a gift of money that he made while they were together. Hr can probably insist that his name be removed from the title so that he is not liable for any accidents or violations tht occur as she is driving the car. But he will remain on the loan until it is paid off or she chooses to refinance. He could offer her payment in return for doing a refinance, but she would not have to accept.Power of AttorneyThe California law of powers of attorney (PoA) is .This requires that  a PoA be signed before at least two adult witnesses (neither of whom is being granted  the PoA) or a notary, that it include the date when it is signed, and that the witnesses see it signed or hear the principal (person granting the PoA) state that he has signed it as a PoA.Section 41123 reads:(a) In a power of attorney under this division, a principal may grant authority to an attorney-in-fact to act on the principals behalf with respect to all lawful subjects and purposes or with respect to one or more express subjects or purposes. The attorney-in-fact may be granted authority with regard to the principals property, personal care, or any other matter.(b) With regard to property matters, a power of attorney may grant authority to make decisions concerning all or part of the principals real and personal property, whether owned by the principal at the time of the execution of the power of attorney or thereafter acquired or whether located in this state or elsewhere, without the need for a description of each item or parcel of property.Section 4264 reads:An attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney may perform any of the following acts on behalf of the principal or with the property of the principal only if the power of attorney expressly grants that authority to the attorney-in-fact:...(c) Make or revoke a gift of the principals property in trust or otherwise....(e) Create or change survivorship interests in the principals property or in property in which the principal may have an interest.(f) Designate or change the designation of beneficiaries to receive any property, benefit, or contract right on the principals death.(g) Make a loan to the attorney-in-fact.Section 4266 reads:The grant of authority to an attorney-in-fact, whether by the power of attorney, by statute, or by the court, does not in itself require or permit the exercise of the power. The exercise of authority by an attorney-in-fact is subject to the attorney-in-facts fiduciary duties.Section 4300 reads:A third person shall accord an attorney-in-fact acting pursuant to the provisions of a power of attorney the same rights and privileges that would be accorded the principal if the principal were personally present and seeking to act. However, a third person is not required to honor the attorney-in-facts authority or conduct business with the attorney-in-fact if the principal cannot require the third person to act or conduct business in the same circumstances.Section 4302 reads:When requested to engage in transactions with an attorney-in-fact, a third person, before incurring any duty to comply with the power of attorney, may require the attorney-in-fact to provide identification, specimens of the signatures of the principal and the attorney-in-fact, and any other information reasonably necessary or appropriate to identify the principal and the attorney-in-fact and to facilitate the actions of the third person in transacting business with the attorney-in-fact. A third person may require an attorney-in-fact to provide the current and permanent residence addresses of the principal before agreeing to engage in a transaction with the attorney-in-fact.S ection 4310 reads:Without limiting the generality of Section 4300, nothing in this chapter requires a financial institution to open a deposit account for a principal at the request of an attorney-in-fact if the principal is not currently a depositor of the financial institution or to make a loan to the attorney-in-fact on the principals behalf if the principal is not currently a borrower of the financial institution.So California does recognize a power of attorney if it is properly executed (witnesses or notary). But a third party may not have accepted it. Or party B may simply not have used it. Party B cannot be compelled to act under the PoA."}
{"question":"A prosecutor seeks an indictment for Charge X, but the grand jury returns a no-bill.Is the prosecutor free to seek another indictment on Charge X from the same grand jury, or from a different one? Does it matter if the prosecutor has new evidence? Is there any limit on how many attempts the government can make?Is the answer different between the federal government and the states?","answer":"The General RuleEven if the charge is presented to a grand jury and it declines to indict, exactly the same charge that one grand jury declined to indict upon can be presented to a future grand jury and produce a valid indictment.A charge upon which a grand jury declines to indict is often not presented to a future grand jury as a matter of prosecutorial discretion or prosecutor's office policy, but generally this is not a mandatory rule.There may be some jurisdiction in the U.S. where this is not the case, and such a statute would not be unconstitutional if it were, but I am not aware of any state where this is prohibited, and I do not believe that this is the case in federal court.Justifications For The General RuleOne reason that it is not a mandatory rule is that there is no practical way that a defendant could enforce the rule if it was a mandatory rule. Grand jury proceedings are secret (at least until an indictment is produced and then only as pertinent to the defendant indicted on the charges producing an indictment).Generally, even the judges in the court calling a grand jury have no access to its proceedings until it issues an indictment, and then has only slightly more latitude to review its proceedings than a defendant in the case.Agreements To Dismiss A Case DistinguishedA prosecutor with jurisdiction over a criminal case that is presented to a grand jury could reach an agreement with a defendant that is binding not to prosecute on a charge in the future, but again, that would be an affirmative act of a prosecutor agreeing to honor a grand jury no bill and there would be no legal requirement that the prosecutor do so.Practical LimitationsNote, however, that there is a downside to repeatedly bringing a case to a grand jury after receiving one or more no bills. A prosecutor has a constitutional obligation arising under the , 373 U.S. 83 (1963), to disclose all exculpatory evidence known to the prosecutor to the defense, upon request.Usually, when a grand jury declines to indict there is something in the evidence presented to it that is exculpatory. A repeated presentation of charges that one or more prior grand jury rejected that ultimately produces a grand jury indictment would usually be strongly suggestive of the fact that there is exculpatory evidence in existence that may not have been disclosed to the final grand jury and that needs to be disclosed to the defense prior to trial.Also, many criminal charges have a statute of limitations, and charges cannot be presented to a grand jury after the statute of limitations for the offense has expired."}

You have an offer, consideration (a promise of something valuable), acceptance, and 'mutuality' i.e. there was no confusion over what you are talking about.

{"question":"I'll say right away, I know this hot topic is politically divisive, but I'm hoping for a neutral explanation by people with experience.Social media companies (in addition to banks, payment processors, website hosting services, and more) are increasingly picking and choosing which clients they will serve.  This picking and choosing is, I don't think can be denied at this point, based at least somewhat on the political opinions of these clients.In response to this, a common defense is \"They're private companies, so they can pick and choose who they want to serve.\"  But this argument holds no water for most other businesses; for example if I run a coffee shop, I can't pick and choose who to serve based on what political paraphernalia they're wearing (or at least, I'm pretty sure I can't).  In general, the government forces American businesses to run any number of ways based on the laws they pass.  We don't live in a libertarian \/ anarcho-capitalist environment, so this \"They're private companies\" argument has always struck me as disingenuous.I know it's a general question, but to what extent can companies pick and choose (that is, discriminate) what clients to serve?

We have decided to form our cooperative under the state's legal business structure for Cooperative Associations  (), and are currently in the process of drafting our Articles of Association and our Bylaws.State regulations force Cooperative Associations to have a certain organizational structure similar to a C corporation, where you have a Board of Directors that governs the organization, and is voted in by the member-owners of the cooperative ().However, we would like our organization to have a 'flatter' organizational structure that does not have a Board of Directors making decisions in the name of the co-op's membership, but rather where all worker-members are Board members who have full, equal membership rights and each get one vote in all collective decisions. We also wish for the legally mandated 'officer' positions to be essentially meaningless titles, that confer no priveleges\/powers to the members who we arbitrarily select to fill them.We have been trying to think of a way to satisfy the legal requirement to have a board, while creating no distinction between board members and 'regular members'. What we came up with for our Bylaws was the following:Immediately upon being granted membership in the Co-op (through the  process described in this section, below) a person is:given one seat on the Co-ops Board of Directors ; and granted equal powers and privileges as all other Board members.Thus all Co-op members are on the Board of Directors, and use of the  words member or members will hereafter imply a person or persons  who are Directors on the Co-ops Board.  The use of the term  collective shall hereafter refer to all of the members of the  cooperative together, with all of the powers, privileges, and  responsibilities granted to the Board by law, and by the Co-ops Articles  of Assocation and Bylaws.  From time to time, as required by RCW 23.86.085, the collective shall elect the following officers: a President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. None of these officers shall have any powers, rights, privileges that differ in any way from other members.Does this satisfy the requirements in RCW 23.86? Is it legal to do this - i.e. to state that every member of an association is on the board and has equal powers\/rights\/responsibilities?Are there any changes that should be made to this that would better describe what we are trying to do?","answer":"You really need to consult a lawyer.While on the face of it there is no maximum limit to the number of directors you may find that this structure has unintended consequences.For example, if a person becomes ineligible to be a director for any reason, does that mean they must leave the co-op?In addition, the government and other members of the public, will expect (and may be legally entitled to believe) that a person with the title of, say Treasurer, does have some special powers and privileges. When you set up an unconventional structure, you may find that your bank, insurers etc. may not be able to deal with you because their internal procedures assume that you will be conventionally structured.There are more practical issues to consider: who has the power to sign cheques? open bank accounts? enter and terminate contracts? etc. If every one of 86 members is required to sign a cheque you are going to need some inconveniently large stationary; not to mention that your suppliers will be waiting six months for payment while you gather the signatures. The reason that the law specifies this type of structure: officers answerable to a board that is answerable to the members is that, by and large, it works.Right now, you may only have 4 or 5 members and what you are proposing may be workable but you should be setting up your business for growth, not stagnation."}

{"question":"For example, let's say the legal name is Bob Ballad. Can a DBA be registered named Tom's Video Editing? And can a website be created named tomsvideoediting.com with the \"About\" page showcasing \"Tom Thomas\", implying that Tom Thomas is the owner of this business (sole proprietorship), even though Tom Thomas doesn't exist?Of course, when registering the DBA itself and doing taxes and whatnot, the legal, real name is used.Now, if that DBA of Tom's Video Editing is legally doable, then how far can that Tom Thomas profile go? When clients contact Bob, they'll be greeted by an email account named Tom Thomas who will ask for their requirements and eventually send the deliverable of the edited video. Payments will be sent to a PayPal business account where the Business Name (publicly shown) is Tom Thomas and the hidden, true registered account holder name is Bob Ballad. Even so, the profile picture of Tom's email account shows the picture of a human face that does not exist (and certainly not Bob's).Note that there are no employee-employer relationships; everything is freelancing and\/or contractors. If clients find out that they've been fooled and Tom doesn't exist and they want to fire Bob, that's fine, but can they sue Bob for this?If all of the above is legally acceptable, then what should the registered DBA be - Tom's Video Editing or Tom Thomas?","answer":"Yes - the above example uses two fictional names from the movie Forest Gump."}
{"question":"If an LLC operates from someone's home, I read (can't find source at the moment) that they want a place in their home where they exclusively work on the business (like a home office) to keep business and their personal lives separate.If they don't do this and do business work from the kitchen, say, they are at risk of piercing the corporate veil.Is this really all it takes to pierce the corporate veil? Assuming that all the other corporate formalities are in place, can I safely work from the living room, for example?On a related note, if I get sued, will I have to prove that the place where I work is separate from where I hang out?","answer":"It would help to know what jurisdiction you're in, but I don't know of any jurisdiction in America where this would be sufficient to pierce the veil.

{"question":"Say Mike the Murderer is on trial and there's no doubt he's the murderer. 12 jurors meet.

In particular, in the case that David is a bad-acting juror.For exampleDavid brags to the other jurors that he wants Mike the Murderer to go free because he's sexyDavid says he hates the other jurors and is hanging the jury to spite themThis is just one example of the broader question of if jurors are allowed to disqualify each other. One final example I want to give is: what if it so happens that two people on the jury are boss Bob and employee Emma? Emma has every reason not to stand up against boss Bob during jury deliberation. What are Emma and Bob supposed to do in this case? And what about the other 10 jurors, if this comes to light?","answer":"Jurors cannot directly disqualify each other. However, they can inform the trial judge if they have reason to believe that one of their peers should be discharged. The judge will then allow the lawyers for both sides to ask the juror questions before deciding to dismiss them. In some jurisdictions, the judge may be required to hold a hearing to examine the evidence. Jurors may also be charged with contempt of court for interfering with a defendant's right to a fair trial, and could be disqualified from jury service in the future.Your examples of juror misconduct point at bias or refusal to deliberate, e.g. when the juror has made up their mind ahead of time (but not because they are using faulty logic). Depending on the jurisdiction, the trial may continue with a smaller jury. In some jurisdictions, the judge will have to declare a mistrial if no replacement juror can be found.See: "}
{"question":"With travel across the US-Canada border being highly restricted (even citizens\/PRs need to quarantine for two weeks on arrival), many Canadian permanent residents living and working in the US near the Canadian border may have difficulty meeting the  of being in Canada for 730 days in a five year period. (Being in Canada for any part of a day counts as a whole day in Canada)One can enter some (very limited) parts of Canada legally though. For example, one can enjoy 9 hectares of Canada by entering , and many married couples separated by the border got to see and hug each other. Would someone living near such parks be able to meet the Canadian permanent residency requirements by going to such parks every day? Assume that one can provide evidence e.g. photographs with timestamps, and social media checkins. Assume that one is also be willing to mount a legal challenge should the Canadian authorities deny that entering the park counts as physical presence in Canada.","answer":"Exact wording might matter here, so I looked up the law. It says 'a permanent resident complies with the residency obligation with respect to a five-year period if, on each of a total of at least 730 days in that five-year period, they are physically present in Canada'.  If you visit the Canadian side of the park, you're 'physically present in Canada'. It would therefore appear that this would meet the requirement.I am by no means an expert in Canadian immigration law, though."}

{"question":"I know this session might seem absurd.I don't like the family name appearing in my passport and will likely change it in a bureaucratic procedure in an interior ministry affiliated consulate (outside the borders of the state of which I hold citizenship) or in a population bureau branch (inside the borders of the state of which I hold citizenship) sometime in the future.My problemI know that in the past, before states became existent generally everywhere besides Antarctica, some people didn't always used family names (people would have been named by a nickname or by one or more parents or by town of origin).My problem is that I never came across a modern state that allows issuing a passport without a family name (let alone a country that accepts a person from such a state, as an expat); so just a personal name would appear there alongside some identification number.My questionsRegarding my problem, I (exceptionally) have two questions:Are there states that don't require having a family name in passport?Are there states that allow a family name to be a number (say, 0, and not as the word zero but as in integer only)?","answer":"There is no limitation on the number of names you can have so long as it is at least 1.  You cannot have a prohibited name (NSW , other states are similar):prohibited name means a name that--(a) is obscene or offensive, or(b) could not practicably be established by repute or usage--(i) because it is too long, or(ii) because it consists of or includes symbols without phonetic significance, or(iii) for some other reason, or(c) includes or resembles an official title or rank, or(d) is contrary to the public interest for some other reason.(b)(ii) prohibits you from having the name 0.However, having any particular name does not mean that a passport will be issued in that name.

{"question":"The question is pretty straightforward: Is it legal to point a domain on the web to someone else's ip (website)?The domain owner is not actually copying the content, but just opening the website in his or her own domain.The resolution happens in the USA and the domain was bought at Google Domains","answer":"YesOne could certainly put up a site whose only content was a link to another domain. And I can't find any law which this would violate.If the link is a deep link, and if it bypasses a log-in page, while the other site is so designed that all access is intended to go through the login, I believe (but cannot at the moment verify)  that the owner of the other site could claim that this violates their copyright. In any case it is not a good idea.But a link to an appropriate page should have no problem, nor should pointing your domain at an appropriate entry page.Therefor, since simply re-pointing a domain should have the same effect as simply linking, in those cases where it works at all, it should be legal. Doing it with an iframe, which would truly open another site within your site, may not be if the other site forbids such use, as in the ToS. The case law on that is not settled, but many sites object to it, as the answer by @BlueDogRanch points out.I don't see a good reason why one would want to do this, but that isn't the question. Copying the HTML of another site and modifying the URLs while keeping the content the same would pretty clearly be a copyright infringement, besides being a lot of work to little obvious point. It also isn't what the question asked about.Building a one-page site that has only a simple link or a redirect would clearly be legal, and would serve the purpose of causing your domain to lead a user to another site, but it isn't, strictly speaking, what was asked about either."}

{"question":"I've just watched the The Alfred Hitchcock Hour episode Three Wives Too Many from 1964.In it, a man has a wife in four different USA states, traveling between them constantly and keeping them secret from one another. Apparently, the punishment was extremely harsh -- death, even?! -- for \"bigamy\", so he's very scared of this becoming revealed.Yet he is legally married to four different females.How is this possible? How can there not have been some sort of central authority keeping track of this, especially if it's not only illegal but an extremely serious crime? Were the different (even nearby) USA \"states\" so extremely detached as to not share this kind of basic information?Maybe it's only silly TV nonsense, but they make it seem like the different states are almost like different parallel worlds. I may also have misunderstood the part where one of the wives threatens him with revealing the whole setup, but she seems to suggest that he will be executed for bigamy.","answer":"Were USA states really this disconnected in 1964Yes.Indeed they still are quite disconnected by the standards of other federated nations. US states have always jealousy guarded their autonomy. Marriage has always been a state responsibility and, in some states, the responsibility is passed onto local government. Even today there is no national register of marriages and there may not even be statewide ones.Notwithstanding, in 1964, marriage records were not computerised. The only record of your marriage was a piece of paper in a filing cabinet. If there are 4 pieces of paper in 4 different filing cabinets in 4 different states (or counties), how would anybody know?Was bigamy really punished by death?The United States, due to the presence of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has had more experience with  than most western nations.

{"question":"In france, there's a thing called the law-screen theory which states that a judge only applies the law, and not the constitution. If someone says they're being tried unconstitutionally, they can claim the law they are opposed is unconstitutional, raise what's called a priority constitutional question which is adjudicated by a special body, the constitutional council, not considered part of the judicial system.I know this is not the case in the US because the SCOTUS adjudicates both statutes and the constitution, but do all (federal) court work this way, applying both the law and the constitution ?I would also (but less) be interested in how that works at the state level, particularly in Louisiana which applies some of the Civil law legal system, akin to the french judicial system.","answer":"Every court in the United States from municipal traffic court to a state court to a U.S. District Court has both the right and the obligation to consider claims of unconstitutionality just like any other legal question that a case presents. Contrary to popular misconception, constitutional law issues are not the exclusive province of the U.S. Supreme Court. Indeed, constitutional issues are only ruled upon in the first instance in the U.S. Supreme Court (or even in a direct appeal from a trial court to the U.S. Supreme Court) in rare and isolated cases. Usually, at least one trial court judge and at least three appellate court judges, and often more appellate court judges, have ruled upon a constitutional issue before the U.S. Supreme Court considers it.This is just as true in Louisiana and Puerto Rico, which have legal systems based upon the civil law legal system, as it is in other U.S. jurisdictions, which have a common law legal system.There is usually only one difference between a case in which the constitutionality of a statute is called into question and one in which it is not. When the constitutionality of a statute is called into question, many state and federal rules of civil procedure require or permit the attorney general of the state whose statute's constitutionality (or the U.S. attorney general when a federal law's constitutionality is at issue) to be joined as a party for the purpose of litigating that issue. This allows the court to receive arguments on the constitutional issue from the public's perspective as well as the perspectives of the parties.A few states also provide that appeals from trial court decisions finding that a statute is unconstitutional are directly to the state supreme court, rather than to the intermediate court of appeals as they would usually be in those states.Notably, the distinct treatment of constitutional issues in many civil law systems is not inherently a part of the civil law system. Constitutional courts are mostly a post-World War II constitutional innovation in the countries where they are found.For example, the law-screen doctrine and the existence of a constitutional court in France, is much younger than core of the rest of the civil law system in France, which invented the civil law system in its modern form more than two hundred years ago. Neither France, at the time Louisiana adopted its civil law legal system through the time of the Louisiana Purchase, nor Spain at the time that Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States after the Spanish-American war, had constitutional courts.Footnote Regarding TreatiesAlso, it is worth remarking that in Europe and much of the rest of the world, the function of protecting individual rights against government authority in a way that is entrenched so that it is not easily overcome by domestic legislation of a current political regime is accomplished through international treaties, rather than only through entrenched rights in a constitution as they are in the United States. Although even then, in many European countries, ordinary courts apply only domestic law and the country in question has to adopt domestic law to conform to the treaties.This treaty mechanism is not very effective in the U.S., because in the U.S., unlike most countries, an ordinary domestic law can override an earlier adopted and ratified international treaty."}
{"question":"In my door-to-door ministry work I've observed various forms of 'No Tresspassing' signs on properties. Do 'Private Property' signs imply the same laws as a 'No Tresspassing' sign?At one house in particular, the owner had posted a sign which said 'Private Property,' but had covered the 'No Tresspassing' part of the sign with duct tape. We skipped that house to stay on the safe side, but would like to know if there are actually any differences in meaning.","answer":"The question for trespassing is whether the trespasser has been adequately notified of the possession interest that another person has in the property. Although it is legal to evangelize door-to-door without a permit, most jurisdictions will require you to leave promptly if the owner asks you to leave. In the absence of such verbal requests, you have a legally protected interest in engaging in conversation with your neighbors. Based on the law as I understand it, it is likely that your jurisdiction will recognize a right to proselytize to your neighbors door-to-door regardless of a no trespassing or private property sign. However, for the sake of certainty, heres a little bit about trespass law. Typically, states have statutes that define what it takes to make a sign conspicuous enough to create grounds for prosecution. Such laws include specifications for the thickness of markings and the signs distance from the ground. Arkansas statutes have established that a person who enters or remains unlawfully on property has committed trespass, which means that the person must enter or remain in or upon the premises when not licensed or privileged to enter or remain in or upon the premises.Communication is key. Arkansas law provides that if the property is unimproved and apparently unused, and is not fenced or otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude an intruder, the person entering the property does so with license and privilege. Generally, however, if a person unlawfully enters property that has been improved, he has trespassed regardless of a sign on the premises devoid of some religious purpose for his visit.Thus, there really is not a significant difference between the No Trespassing sign and the Private Property sign. Both would communicate to any potential intruder that the property he is about to enter is presently being possessed by another person and thus would likely be sufficient to provide grounds for claiming notice in court if a property owner should choose to bring a suit.

{"question":"My girlfriend lives in China. She is a Chinese citizen. I'm an American. We want to get married My concern: I have kids so I want to protect them. So naturally i want to sign a prenup. If she was here in America, that would be a piece of cake. But how do I sign it there. Or is there any way to bring her here and then get married? ","answer":"Applicable LawA marital agreement can be entered into both before marriage (a prenup) and after marriage (a postnup). And, it will have the same legal effect in either case once entered into by the parties.In practice, marital agreements are usually proposed by a more affluent spouse and are reviewed by a less affluent spouse who will be giving up many of the legal economic rights usually associated with being married because the alternative is to not get married at all and the less affluent spouse thinks that marriage is still worth it even with fewer economic rights.The governing principle of marital agreements is that they must be entered into with the highest level of voluntariness, good faith, and full disclosure.Typically, a prenup with (1) limit the rights of the less affluent spouse in a property division upon divorce, (2) limit the less affluent spouse's inheritance rights, (3) limit the less affluent spouse's right to maintenance (a.k.a. alimony) upon divorce or legal separation, and (4) limit the less affluent spouse's rights to attorneys' fees in the event of a divorce. Often, these limitations are phased in superficially more equal terms, but the agreement only has a practical affect limiting a spouse's legal economic rights in marriage on the less affluent spouse, when it is recognized that one spouse is starting out affluent and the other spouse is starting out less affluent.The question states that: 'I have kids so I want to protect them.' So, determining precisely what you want to protect your kids from and how, in a manner that your spouse, courts evaluating the agreement in the future, and immigration officials, would consider to be legitimate, would be critical. You should know what impact a death or divorce would have during a short lived marriage for someone in your shoes because you start trying to change the rules, because you might be surprised to learn that the status quo is less unfair than you believe it to be. For example, in many states, property owned by one party before the marriage was commenced is not subject to division as marital property upon divorce and often the right to alimony following a short marriage that does not produce children is quite modest.Also, if you are extremely worried about the possibility that your new marriage could fail and that this would force you to make economic sacrifices that you do not think would be acceptable under the status quo in the absence of a prenup, you might want to think twice about whether getting marriage in the way that you are planning to get marriage is really a good idea. Excessive worries about a break up that is damaging to you may be your subconscious's way of telling you that you have grave concerns about this marriage that could be deal breaking, as well as your outward positive hopes and dreams that may be unrealistic. You had a relationship or marriage that failed once. You may be ready for a more successful relationship now, but you need to be comfortable that the circumstances that caused your previous marriage to fail are unlikely to recur.No prenup will ever make a divorce easy or painless, although it can bring some predictability to the process, if a prenup is well drafted and reasonable.Typically, :it must be in writing;it will contain no invalid terms (e.g., in most cases, terms relating to child support or parental responsibilities, or terms that make marital fault relevant to the economic rights of the parties);both parties will have reviewed a complete disclosure of the other party's financial circumstances;each party will have had an opportunity to consult with a lawyer familiar this these agreements (at the other party's expense if the person agreeing to it can not afford a lawyer of their own);each party will review the terms of the agreement in a language that they can understand, and the circumstances under which the agreement is signed will not be under duress broadly defined (for example, to include presentation of the agreement on the eve of the wedding day without adequate time to consider its terms without undue negative consequences if the spouse does not agree). Typically, the lawyer for each party would sign the agreement to confirm that all formal requirements and counsel regarding the agreement has taken place.A marital agreement that doesn't meet the applicable legal standards (which vary state to state). I have cited the law in Colorado which requires parties to follow what would only be considered 'best practices' in many other states, although there would be plenty of states where these legal standards would apply.A marital agreement is still not valid if it is unconscionable to a spouse at the time it is to be enforced, for example, leaving one spouse unable to meet her basic needs and the other spouse wealthy after a long marriage.There is no requirement that a prenup be signed in any particular country or place, so long as the person signing it understands that their signature is intended to be binding. There is no requirement that a prenup be signed by both spouses at the same time, as long as both spouses sign it before it is to become effective.Realistically, as of 2017 in an average cost of living U.S. area, you are probably looking a legal expenses and related expenses involved in making a prenup happen given the need for Chinese speaking legal professionals and logistical issues, at an expense of $7,500 to $15,000 or more to get a prenup done under this circumstances. You would need to decide if this expense was worth the benefit to you.OptionsIt could be signed by your spouse while your spouse to be is in China, if the proper formalities are observed. In terms of the enforceability of the agreement, and the likelihood that it will be executed, this is probably the best option. But, as a practical matter this may be difficult to accomplish this because lawyers knowledgeable about U.S. law who can communicate in the spouse's topolect of Chinese may be hard to find, and Chinese attitudes towards prenups may be different from those of people in the U.S. Negotiating a prenup in the face of a quite new relationship that often doesn't have a lot of depth at the start and is based upon mutual hope and a belief that the couple has shared interests as much as an actual long term relationship prior to getting engaged (which is common in marriages of the kind described in this question) can present a difficult challenge for the couple as they develop a marriage relationship very early on in their process when they don't have a lot of communication and relationship foundation to build upon.Of course, there are exceptions to every rule. Suppose that you've known your girlfriend continuously since she was 14 years old and she is now 24 (you are 25) and both of you are fluently bilingual, because you grew up next to an embassy and she was the daughter of an embassy official and you went to prom together, and then the two of you went to college and graduate school together living together for five of those years. Suppose that she is from a wealthy family and needs the pre-nup to protect her family's wealth, and you are not very affluent despite being the U.S. spouse. Suppose that she's was a paralegal in a family law firm that draws up prenups when she was in college before moving back to China when she finished her studies, while you are a divorce lawyer, and that the two of you have talked about marital agreements for years. This might not be much of a relationship issue and might not pose the kinds of immigration questions raised below. But, if you fell into one of the exceptions to the general rule, you wouldn't be asking this question in the first place in all likelihood.It is possible  which allows a foreign spouse to immigrate to the United States with an intent to marry upon arrival. But, in that situation there would be real doubt about whether a marital agreement signed upon arrival would be truly voluntary because failing to agree to the prenup and not getting marriage as a result would result in the financee's immediate deportation and terminate a wedding that the wife had already moved half way across the world and given up everything to participate in.It is possible to execute a post-nup, but in that case, if it was truly voluntary, the wife probably wouldn't sign it because it would mean that she would be giving up rights that she had already acquired as a result of the marriage for nothing in return, and if it was involuntary, then it wouldn't be valid. (There are circumstances when a post-nup can make sense for a spouse to voluntarily enter into after marriage, for example, to make rich relatives comfortable including a person in their Will or making a large gift to one of the spouses that is intended to stay in the family but will benefit the spouse during the marriage and the couple's children, but the facts in the question don't naturally suggest any of those circumstances.)Immigration ConcernsUnlike an ordinary marriage, which is presumed to be valid and in good faith, marriages which afford a spouse the right to immigrate to the U.S. and in due course, to become a U.S. citizen if certain other requirements are met, are carefully scrutinized for signs that it is a 'sham marriage' and immigration judges can be quite skeptical in determining whether or not a marriage is a sham. Couples go to great lengths to prove otherwise, and the burden is effectively placed upon them to show that they are not engaged in marriage fraud and instead actually married for love.If a marriage with an immigrant is found to be a sham, the immigrant's visa will be revoked, the immigrant's citizenship application will be denied, and the immigrant may become deportable. There may also be sanctions for the citizen or permanent resident spouse who sponsored the immigrant.One factor among many that can be considered  is the existence of a prenup or postnup, and even more importantly, its terms. The more unfavorable the terms of the prenup or postnup are to the immigrant spouse, the more likely it is that an immigration official will conclude that a marriage is a sham for immigration purposes. There isn't a hard and fast rule, but it is one factor that is considered among others in reaching that determination. The key factors in evaluating a prenup for immigration purposes are the terms of the agreement. The more the immigrant spouse's legal rights in the marriage are limited, the more likely immigration officials are to view the marriage as a sham and the couple as engaged in marriage fraud.On the other hand, if all a prenup does is to insure that a new spouse and children from a former relationship have equal inheritance rights and no rights upon divorce are modified at all, immigration officials may view the prenup as relatively innocuous. ConclusionThere are a lot of good reasons not to get a prenup in the circumstances you identify if most of my hunches about the usual circumstances involved when someone asks a question of the kind that you have are true.Before taking this step, you would be wise to consult with a lawyer to see what the likely economic and legal consequences of a divorce or death in the absence of a prenup would likely be in your case, as I suspect that your fears may be exaggerated or may involve issues that a prenup can't address. It could be that once you are well informed it is still clear to you that a prenup is a good decision. But, given multiple indications that this may not be a good choice for you, I would strongly suggest thinking twice about this decision after conferring with a lawyer about your individualized circumstances before going forward with this plan."}
{"question":"According to this , Lord Aldington managed to join  pro bono legal defenders for Nikolai Tolstoy as defendants in his libel lawsuit.'In 1996 the Court of Appeal upheld an order Aldington had obtained that made lawyers acting for Tolstoy pro bono parties to the case, and thereby jointly liable with Tolstoy for any costs or damages awarded to Aldington.'How could this happen in the U.K.? Is this 'normal' British justice, or was the law twisted to benefit a highly placed plaintiff?  Could this happen in the US, Canada, Australia, or anywhere else in the English-speaking world?Perhaps the issue is one of 'champerty and maintenance,' the theory being that the pro bono lawyers 'subsidized' the defendant, and therefore had the means to pay. If that's the case, what's to prevent rich Englishmen from going around and suing poor people they dislike, knowing that the latter don't have the means to defend themselves?","answer":"I think Michael Flatley of 'Riverdance' was accused of rape, countersued, and managed to get the opposing lawyer to court as well, with a judge saying that the lawyer knew that the whole case was just blackmail and a lawyer trying to help his client to blackmail somebody has no protection by the law. (The woman wanting about $30 million for rape damages ended up ordered to pay \uffe111 million for libel). So something like that may have happened here as well. On the other hand, I heard of cases where a third party sponsoring a law case (by paying for lawyers etc. ) with the goal of benefitting from the case (even if it is just to get their money back) can become liable for damages. Basically if A with deep pockets gives B who has no cash money to sue C, and C wins, then C can try to get money back from the rich A, not only from the penniless B. "}
{"question":"I put in a maintenance request at my apartment a few weeks ago. Someone came by the next day to inspect the issue and left a note, which basically said 'We will need to call technicians to fix something outside the building, but in the meantime I did [temporary fix] for your apartment.' Worked for me, hadn't heard anything since.Yesterday, I got home and found a mess in my apartment. Apparently maintenance was there again (or it was broken into by someone who likes taking apart air ducts..). No note unlike every other time they've been there, so I was pretty unnerved until I found where they'd been working.I was not notified about this in advance. I looked through  and it says:If the tenant makes a request for maintenance, the landlord is not required to provide notice to the tenant.When does this 'free access' expire, if ever? Is there a set time period, or does it last until they deem the maintenance request completed?","answer":"You have accurately located the law applicable to the legal issue presented. I would consider the application of the law to this fact pattern to be a close call that reasonable people could interpret either way. Your suggestion that the right to access lasts until the maintenance request is completed is a pretty attractive bright line to draw between when access is allowed and when it isn't under the circumstances. In the absence of evidence that the landlord has abandoned the maintenance order, so long as the work isn't done and someone is continuing to do work for the problem described in the order (and as you note parenthetically, this is surely what is going on) the landlord is probably in the right here. Also, it isn't terribly out of the ordinary for it to take weeks to get a repair job fixed. At some point, maybe a year or two, the claim that the landlord abandoned the maintenance order might look more plausible, but those aren't your facts."}

But suppose they weren't public figures?","answer":"(Most of this post is focused on discussion of the surrounding issues, with little in the way of advice.  If you actually have to deal with this problem, skip to the end.)American defamation law is extraordinarily weak (relative to Europe) thanks to , so I'll just be focusing on American law.On the other hand,  (NB: In New York, the 'State Supreme Court' is the lowest court in the state).  For our purposes, here is the most relevant paragraph:  Mr. Batra filed his lawsuit under a doctrine known as libel-in-fiction. To win his case, he must demonstrate that the identities of the real and fictional characters must be so complete that the defamatory material becomes a plausible aspect of the plaintiffs real life, Justice Shafer wrote in her ruling, quoting case law.It seems to me that a composite character could not pass that test.  But it's less clear to me that this standard is in use across the entire US (what case is the judge quoting from?).  And frankly, you don't really want to be in court arguing over this sort of thing unless you're very clearly in the right.  In this case, NBC has already lost, because they now need to go through discovery and probably a full trial.  That's expensive.  (Actually, this happened back in 2008, but I haven't been able to find any further information about this case via cursory Googling.  I imagine they quietly settled, but I can't confirm that.  If anyone has a more recent link, it would really help.)I found that link in , which seems to be very detailed and well-referenced.  I would suggest consulting it for further information.If you look at the copyright page of a book, you may see a  like this one:  This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents either are products of the authors imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.I find it rather hard to believe you can actually disclaim liability with a notice buried in part of the book which no one reads (unlike contract law, the reader never explicitly 'agrees' to this disclaimer), but it probably doesn't hurt.In short: Talk to your publisher, your editor, and their lawyer(s).  They've dealt with this issue before and have a vested interest in helping you.  If you're self-publishing, it's probably a good idea to discuss this and other legal issues (such as copyright registration) with a lawyer, since doing all those things by yourself can get rather complicated."}
{"question":"Is there a particular circumstance where the U.S. president can be tried for declaring war against another country? What are the criteria for the president to be tried for declaring war?

However, this could not be the International Criminal Court since the US does not acknowledge its jurisdiction.

{"question":"I live in the state of Maryland. Several years ago I went to the ER to have an injury treated. I presented my insurance at the time of the injury. About a month ago (several years after the ER visit) I was contacted by Phoenix Financial Services, a debt collection agency saying I owed a significant amount of money for the physician portion of the services (the hospital was paid separately). Recently, I found out from my insurance that the physician's billing services never billed them. My insurer notified me that per the insurer's contract with this physician group, the physician group may not bill the patient until they have submitted a claim. So, not only should this group have never sent this bill to a debt collector, they shouldn't have sent me a bill in the first place.I called the physician group today and they agreed they will write the bill off after confirming that I am eligible for my insurance.I have Googled around and learned briefly about the concept of debt validation. Here is what I don't understand. Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, it appears that a debt collector can demand payment (with the threat of harming your credit score) until you request a debt validation. Is it true that a debt collector has no responsibility to validate the debt (e.g. make sure it's legit) until after you ask them?","answer":"It is correct, per , that the collector can wait until the consumer files notifies the collector of the debt, before sending verification. The law does not state what form that verification must take, and it would suffice if the collector provided evidence that services were rendered and not paid for. The verification can't just be a restatement that 'you owe $10,000', but it does not have to be in the form of a court's judgment that the consumer owes money. Taking all of the provisions of the act together, the debt-holder's ultimate recourse is to take you to court, so that you will be ordered to pay the debt. One of your options is to tell the debt collector to not contact you, which forces the debt-holder to sue you. Demanding verification of the debt is an option, potentially useful in case of a mistake, especially in overcoming the assumption that the collector can otherwise make, that the debt is valid. At some point, one might need to prove in court that the debt is not valid (and it didn't come to that in your case). In this case, the debt is valid (you did receive the services), the problem is something else.There is no statutory requirement that an ER must submit claims to a person's insurance company. They may be required to do so as part of their contract with Acme Insurance, if they have a contract with Acme. That is a matter between Acme and the ER, and you cannot sue the ER for failing to follow the terms of their contract with Acme. You might sue Acme if they fail to perform a contractual obligation with you, but they have no obligation to sue an ER to keep you happy. Suing your insurance company would be pointless, because Acme didn't fail to do what they were supposed to do. Suing the ER would also be pointless, because (or, assuming) they didn't promise to bill your insurance first. You would need to look carefully at the terms of your contract with the ER Physicians Group (not the hospital). It is likely that they have some kind of liability disclaimer stating that they are not liable for damage arising from insurance screw-ups. And finally, suing the debt collector would be also pointless because from your report of the facts, they didn't violate the law and you don't have a contractual relationship with the collector.One can always get a free initial consultation with an attorney to see if he thinks there is a case.

Eviction is a summary judgment process and the law requires meticulous adherence to process and procedure.

{"question":"Tools such as the 'WiFi pineapple' are rising in popularity in penetration testing and hacking communities. These devices are designed to allow and explicitly marketed as being able to intercept WiFi communications. They are sold online to anyone who wants one. My question is weather or not these count as 'communication intercepting devices' as defined by Section 2512. A well known version of this type of tool, the WiFi pineapple () specifically advertises the ability to intercept communications. To clarify, I'm trying to find out why they get a seeming exemption, and what would be too 'far' to be legal for my own experimentation with wireless security hardware. The why it is fairly important so I know where to start for my own research.Is it illegal to Manufacture, distribute, possess, or advertise the WiFi pineapple or similar devices, per Section 2512?","answer":"On the face of it, manufacturing such devices is a crime (but there is no civil remedy against the manufacturer if you get intercepted: see  for a similar device:  The complaint therefore adequately alleges a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7  2512(1)(b).

Section 2512(1)(b) itself does not allow for such a suit  because it provides only that the violator will be fined ? or  imprisoned. Luis's private cause of action for such a violation thus  depends on the proper interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520.Criminal prosecution can happen, see , for cases involving satellite descramblers. It is most likely that these devices intercept electronic communication: there is a loophole regarding stored communication, but it is likely that these devices pass the contemporaneity test.

{"question":"President Trump has made assertions that former President Obama 'wire tapped' him and Trump has claimed that he has evidence of this. It begins to appear that Trump has been lying about this and that he actually has no 'evidence'. It also appears that the U.S. security agencies do not have any evidence of this illegal 'wire tapping' ever occurring. Does former President Obama have a libel case against Trump? The accusations were unequivocal. Is President Trump protected by some form of Presidential immunity such that he can make any sort of accusation without suffering any legal consequence?","answer":"Sure Obama can sue Trump for defamation. Libel is a civil offense and committing libel is not a part of Trump's role as president. Regarding official acts, the President is immune. But not for personal acts. See But a libel action would be difficult to win; they're both public figures, which makes the defamation threshold higher:  Public officials and figures have a harder time proving defamation.  The public has a right to criticize the people who govern them, so the  least protection from defamation is given to public officials. When  officials are accused of something that involves their behavior in  office, they have to prove all of the above elements of defamation and  they must also prove that the defendant acted with 'actual malice.'  The 'actual malice' part is interesting:  In the landmark 1964 case of New York Times v. Sullivan, the U.S.  Supreme Court .... acknowledged that in public discussions --  especially about public figures like politicians -- mistakes can be  made. If those mistakes are 'honestly made,' the Court said, they  should be protected from defamation actions. The court made a rule  that public officials could sue for statements made about their public  conduct only if the statements were made with 'actual malice.' 'Actual  malice' means that the person who made the statement knew it wasn't  true, or didn't care whether it was true or not and was reckless with  the truth -- for example, when someone has doubts about the truth of a  statement but does not bother to check further before publishing it. (same link above)Could malice be proved? Was Trump reckless with the truth? Could be.But would Obama sue? What's the cost\/benefit analysis to him and his legacy, politically and personally?Trump was taking a political or personal risk - or he's being stupid - with such accusations, since he may feel invulnerable. He has sued and been sued and settled many times: see I think both would not want to be in court; because once in court, they (and their lawyers) both have subpoena power and both would have to answer nearly any question put to them about their public (and possibly private; but not official) lives.Trump has interestingly enough talked about 'opening up the libel laws' so he can more easily sue people. But if he did that, it cuts both ways: he would be easier to take to court. See In my opinion, Obama is much better off ignoring Trump and letting the FBI, DOJ, Congress and the Intel Community do their jobs - have the facts fall where they may - and and not become a right-wing talk radio subject for the rest of his life, as well as risk being deposed himself in court.Edit 3\/21\/17:From a timely piece in The New Yorker:   While it is unlikely that former President Barack Obama would sue  Trump for libel, he very likely has a strong case. The First Amendment  scholar Geoffrey Stone wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times  that there  seems no doubt that Trumps statement was false, defamatory, and at  the very least made with reckless disregard for the truth. That is  the test for damaging the reputation of a public figure or official:  Trump either made his assertions with knowledge of their falsity or  with disregard of a high degree of probability that they were false.  Obama, Stone is confident, could prove that Trump made his false  charge, as the Supreme Court defined the standard, with actual  malice."}
{"question":"I'm a Filipino passport-holder but I also have an expired US green card. I'm currently in South Korea for my master's degree and I wish to visit USA this summer to see family. My green card's expiry date is August 2017. I applied for a master's program scholarship March 2017, got accepted in June 2017, got my ticket from the scholarship organization July 2017, and flew out August 2017. I didn't (couldn't?) renew my green card due to following reasons:Yes, I could've renewed 6 months before it expired as recommended, but I didn't expect I'd get a full-ride scholarship for a master's degree. My plan was to renew my green card after graduation (May 2017) because I had to save up $540 for the renewal fee.Let's say I did renew my green card 6 months before or before it's expiration date AND got accepted to the scholarship program July 2017...There would be no guarantee that I'd have my greencard before August 2017 as it takes 5-9 months for the new green card to be issued;If I did renew and got my new green card before August 2017, I'd have to apply for a re-entry permit and that's another 2-3 months of waiting... I was accepted 2 months before so, again, there's no guarantee I'd have said re-entry permit before August 2017.Because the scholarship process went by so fast, I was a bit stressed with what to do with my green card. I have all intention to remain a US permanent resident but I also couldn't just throw away a FREE master's scholarship program (knowing that US higher-ed is just extremely expensive). Back to my question...I want to visit family this coming summer break. But of course I have to come back to Korea to finish my master's... and I plan to go back to USA after obtaining my master's degree. Is my best option to apply for a tourist visa? Do I need to give up my green card? Am I considered as someone who abandoned their residency? Are there other better options in my case that would allow me to visit US for a bit and finish my degree then go back to US? Also, I'm an 'international student' in Korea. I live in my school dorm and have NO purchases of an apartment, car, or any of that. I just have a Korean bank account.","answer":"You will probably not be allowed to enter the United States if your visa is expired. Sometimes foreign student advisors at a college or an immigration attorney will know how to expedite the process to get it renewed in time. Also, sometimes the offeror of a scholarship can move it back to accommodate your inability to get a timely visa renewal, assuming that it is possible to get a visa renewal at all. Applications from the Philippines are processed more slowly than applications from any other country as a matter of official policy.It also isn't obvious to me that you are really talking about a green card (lawful permanent residency) as opposed to a student visa. A tourist visa does not suffice in cases where you need either a student visa or a green card.You need professional help ASAP as this is a highly technical, non-intuitive area, even if that means paying an immigration lawyer hundreds of dollars."}
{"question":"My understanding is that one of the  parts of DA Bragg's indictment of former President Trump is the decision to elevate the charges of falsifying business records  ordinarily a misdemeanor under New York state law  to the felony charges (under New York state law) of doing so with an intent to defraud [that] includes an intent to commit another crime, where in this case the \"[other] crimes\" in question are federal laws. There is arguably some legal ambiguity whether federal laws are included in the \"other crimes\" portion of the relevant New York state law.Could DA Bragg have only charged Trump with 34 misdemeanor counts, without elevating the charges to felonies? I believe that had he done so, he would not have needed to empanel a grand jury, since misdemeanor-only charges do not require a grand jury vote to indict. I also understand that such an action may have been politically awkward for Bragg, since he campaigned on a  not to prosecute misdemeanor-only offenses. But would anything else stop him from doing so?Am I correct that if Trump's defense team argues that the law that elevates the misdemeanor charges to felony charges does not apply in this case, because the elevation option does not include federal laws, then since this is a matter of law and not a matter of fact, Judge Mercan (rather than the jury) will decide whether or not to dismiss the felony charges? Does Judge Mercan have the option of dismissing the felony enhancement but allowing the misdemeanor charges to proceed, or would Mercan have to dismiss all charges against Trump?If Trump is brought to trial, then would it be possible for a jury to return a verdict that Trump was guilty of the misdemeanor offenses of falsifying business records but innocent of doing so with an intent to commit another crime? If so, then could Trump still be found guilty of the misdemeanors, or would he be fully acquitted, since the jury ruled that he was not guilty of the exact charges that DA Bragg filed?","answer":"Could DA Bragg have only charged Trump with 34 misdemeanor counts,without elevating the charges to felonies?Yes.if Trump's defense team argues that the law that elevates themisdemeanor charges to felony charges does not apply in this case,because the elevation option does not include federal laws, then sincethis is a matter of law and not a matter of fact, Judge Mercan (ratherthan the jury) will decide whether or not to dismiss the felonycharges?Yes.Does Judge Mercan have the option of dismissing the felony enhancementbut allowing the misdemeanor charges to proceed, or would Mercan haveto dismiss all charges against Trump?Judge Mercan could probably choose either option if he found that the original charges were not supported by the law. There is law regarding how this decision is made but I personally don't know that area of law well.One of the reason that I am unfamiliar with it is that it is exceedingly rare for a judge to conclude that the prosecutor's charges are not supported by the law.I would be very surprised if that judge reached that conclusion in this case, in particular, because both federal election law violations and state and federal tax law violations are implicated by the indictment. The DA no doubt legally researched this issue exhaustively before presenting the charges to the grand jury and has made out a prima facie case for a felony under the applicable New York State law.If Trump is brought to trial, then would it be possible for a jury toreturn a verdict that Trump was guilty of the misdemeanor offenses offalsifying business records but innocent of doing so with an intent tocommit another crime? If so, then could Trump still be found guilty ofthe misdemeanors, or would he be fully acquitted, since the jury ruledthat he was not guilty of the exact charges that DA Bragg filed?Whether a jury is presented with a lesser included offense charge at the request of the defense, is partially a matter of the prosecution's election to make that option available or not, and partially a matter of the judge's decision on how to handle it. The body of law involved in how this decision is handled on a case by case basis is quite involved.Most of the case law involves homicide cases, assault cases, and property crime cases where there are charges with are identical except for aggravating factors for the most serious charges. But, lesser charges generally aren't presented if based upon the evidence presented at trial, either the more serious charge is established or no charge is proven.For example, if the defendant presents an alibi defense, and a witness whose credibility is disputed places the defendant at the scene intentionally committing a crime, a lesser included offense charge would not be appropriate.But, if the defendant admits hitting a pedestrian and causing the pedestrian's death, but claims that the pedestrian was at fault in the accident for jay walking, while the prosecution alleges that the pedestrian was intentionally struck as part of a mafia hit, multiple lesser included offenses would probably be charged involving different levels of intent of premeditated intent\/aggravated circumstances killing (first degree murder), to a knowing killing (second degree murder), to a reckless killing (manslaughter), to a criminally negligent homicide or vehicular homicide charge.Typically, the decision on this point would not be made until all evidence was received and the judge in a hearing away from the jury but in the presence of the prosecutors and defense counsel crafted jury instructions based upon the evidence presented at trial and the arguments raised by counsel at trial."}

My question:Can I tell USCIS that the rule (4 years and one day) applies to me, and therefore I do not need to provide evidence?

{"question":"In my divorce decree which was in Texas, I was ordered to pay child support, which I paid. In the decree right above the judge's signature was a notice in bold letters that stated that failure to pay child support can bring a jail term of up to 6 months and a fine.In a friends ongoing divorce in New Jersey, her husband was ordered to pay child support of xxx per month. However he is paying about half of the amount.When my friend asked her attorney if they could enforce him to pay the entire amount, including arrears of nearly 4 grand, they told her that they couldn't enforce him to pay by threatening jail as long as he's 'paying something.'This doesn't make sense to me, as I am fairly certain that penalties of contempt of court exist in New Jersey as well as probably every other state in the US.What legal remedies are available for failure to pay the entire amount due for child support? Especially when arrears have accumulated that are above 4 thousand dollars? Or is her attorney correct?","answer":"Generally speaking, contempt of court focuses on the person's deliberate noncompliance with the terms of the court order. If your friend files a motion to show cause, she would need to prove that the parent has not fully complied with the order despite his ability to do so. Or perhaps the burden of proof is on the non-compliant parent, depending on how that works in family\/divorce matters.  they told her that they couldn't enforce him to pay by threatening  jail as long as he's 'paying something.'That is accurate under reasonable circumstances. For instance, a parent with a good income would not (or should not) be allowed to elude a finding of contempt merely by paying $1\/month.

{"question":"In  (8 Criminal Law Quarterly 137 (1965-66)), a Canadian case, a member of the First Nations of Canada had relieved a wounded pony of his suffering by gunshot and was accused pursuant section 2 of the Small Birds Act (R.S.O.). The case was initially dismissed and went on appeal. Blue, J., delivers the opinion for the court, granting the appeal, saying:For the purpose of the Small Birds Act, all two-legged,  feather-covered animals are birds. This, of course, does not imply  that only two-legged animals qualify, for the legislative intent is to  make two legs merely the minimum requirement. The statute therefore  contemplated multi-legged animals with feathers as well.Counsel submits that having regard to the purpose of the statute only  small animals naturally covered with feathers could have been  contemplated. However, had this been the intention of the legislature,  I am certain that the phrase naturally covered would have been  expressly inserted just as Long was inserted in the Longshoremans  Act.Therefore, a horse with feathers on its back must be deemed for the  purpose of this Act to be a bird, a fortiori, a pony with feathers on  its back is a small bird.You see, the impoverished accused had traded his saddle for a downy pillow... Some 15 years later, the case is cited in a  in U.S. v. Byrnes (644 F.2d 107 (2d Cir. 1981)), a case about rare birds smuggling. The note is referenced at the end of this part of the judgment (Mulligan, J., N.Y):Therefore, the point [registration] was made and her conceded ignorance of the  Migratory Bird regulations hardly establishes that she didn't possess the swans which she didn't consider birds in any  event. [footnote 9].The note begins with the following introduction: ' For a liberal construction of the term 'birds,' by a Canadian court see [Ojibway] ' and goes on to quote the case as I did above. The case doesn't rely on\/follow Ojibway; it simply says in a note, that a statute on birds can receive a liberal construction elsewhere.But still, the issue is that Regina v. Ojibway is not a real case: it is a parody (Pomerantz & Breslin, The Canada Law Book Company, 1965-66), yet a  from 1997 about wildlife law seriously referenced the case (as being cited in Byrnes) in its introduction, albeit to mention it as a bizarre result from trying to ascertain what is wildlife. In his discussion, however, he does not say whether he thinks Mulligan J., who did not label the case as fiction in 1981, actually went through the 'whoosh' himself like he says. Hence this question about sources and damage control, some 50 years after the pony bird:Is Regina v. Ojibway (or Ojibway v. R.) referenced without mention of it being  in any othercase law (in the U.S. or elsewhere i.e. U.K)? Are there any other such fictional cases which are notorious for havingbeen seriously referenced (by courts, legal scholars) like Ojibway was in Byrnes?What mechanisms (rules of practice, institutional), if any, are in place to prevent reliance on such (fictional) cases? Why has peer review seemingly been unable to outdo the authority of legal reporting\/law reviews in this case (as surely there is no trace of the case at the courthouse)? Or is it common knowledge in the field that Ojibway is fiction at this point?","answer":"Read the whole opinion. It's pretty clear the judge was having some fun with it. Judges do this from time to time. When someone involved in the case didn't consider seagulls, ducks, or geese to be birds, and the judge is writing a humorous opinion, he'll pick up on that, and a joke about horses with down pillows on their back counting as birds is a natural response to someone who's heard of the parody."}
{"question":"Scenario (Utah, USA): A defendant is arraigned at a pre-trial hearing. Charges include driving without insurance and driving with an expired license.State law declares that those who do these things are guilty of misdemeanors in each case, and prescribes a minimum penalty for each if found guilty.The defendant expresses a desire for a trial, and seeing that these are criminal charges, he exercises his State and Federal Constitutional right to a jury trial to respond to those charges.The judge immediately prevaricates and solicits input from the prosecutor, who promptly adjusts the charges to \"infractions\". The judge then repeatedly affirms that a jury trial is not an option because no criminal charges are being made, despite criminal charges having been the cause of the arraignment.The judge attempts to coerce either a bench trial or a plea deal, repeatedly saying that since no criminal charges are being made, no jury trial can be arranged.The State Constitution also says that \"All laws of a general nature shall have uniform operation\".In the same jurisdiction, people arraigned with identical initial charges and with comparable evidences against them have been charged as misdemeanors, pled guilty or issued a plea in abeyance, and were convicted by a bench trial with no further findings beyond police reports or pulling their traffic records, and were left with a criminal record on account of the conviction, and required to pay a commensurate fine and being required to conform to additional sentencing.Can the prosecutor and\/or the judge be sued for dereliction of duty, and for non-uniform application of the law?Can the outcome of a bench trial be appealed on grounds that the judge did not inform the defendant of his rights or that his rights were taken away by unwarranted modification of the charges?","answer":"Can the prosecutor and\/or the judge be sued for dereliction of duty,and for non-uniform application of the law?No.Judges and prosecutors have absolute immunity from civil liability for their actions in the course of their duties in connection with the court process.Prosecutors have effectively absolute discretion in their charging decisions and in their decisions to reduce the charges sought against a defendant (prior to jeopardy attaching when a jury is sworn in).Can the outcome of a bench trial be appealed on grounds that the judgedid not inform the defendant of his rightsYes.or that his rights were taken away by unwarranted modification of thecharges?No.Incidentally, there is no federal constitutional right to a jury trial in a case where six months or less of incarceration is sought as a penalty, and there is no federal constitutional right to counsel unless incarceration is a possible penalty.The Utah State Constitution distinguishes between criminal matters and non-criminal matters in several respects mostly found in the state's bill of Rights () in Sections 8, 10, 12, 13, and 19.But, it is fundamentally the right of the state through its prosecutors to decide what charges to press against someone, and they are well within their rights to change their minds. Often, this will be in your favor because reducing an offense to a civil infraction rather than a misdemeanor will have far fewer collateral consequences related to having a criminal record."}

{"question":"This is a follow-up from my previous .Following my discussion with HR about the ethical violation of my manager and some colleagues, I was suddenly fired without any prior notice from my current employer. They put a few false labels on me, and give me a termination letter. They also asked me to return the sign-on bonus back.What are the US laws for firing an employee? Shouldn't I get an unemployed payment for a few months or something similar? I'm in Texas, US. In the employment letter, the phrase 'at-will' is used.","answer":"At Will Employment - In GeneralAn at will employee in the U.S. can be fired at any time for any reason without any prior notice or warning. Outside a union shop or a civil service employment situation, even an illegal reason for firing does not give you the right to be reinstated in your job - instead it gives you a right to sue for money damages.Unemployment Benefits and Employment ReferencesIf you are fired for good cause (or you quit in a situation that is not a constructive termination), you are not entitled to unemployment benefits.If you are fired without cause particular to your conduct (e.g. you are laid off in the employer's reduction in the size of the employer's labor force), or your are fired for a reason that is not good cause (e.g. you are fire because the boss is annoyed because you are such a goody two shoes that you always show up to work on time), you may be entitled to unemployment benefits based upon your term of service and earnings (short time employees are often not entitled to unemployment benefits no matter what).If you apply for unemployment benefits because you assert that you were fired without good cause, and the employer believes you were fired for good cause, the employer can dispute that finding in a summary administrative hearing. Employers fight awards of unemployment benefits for employees who are fired rather than laid off, because it affects the employer's unemployment insurance rates (and because they care, for non-economic reasons, if the integrity of their stated reasons for firing someone are not believed, or if their reasons for firing someone are not considered to be legitimate grounds for termination by a government agency).Even if you are entitled to unemployment benefits, these benefits are much smaller than your regular pay, and generally last less long than the period for which you were employed. A formula or calculator should appear on the .I assume when you say that They put a few fake tags on me that this means that they stated reasons that would be valid for cause reasons for termination and you dispute those reasons apply to you, but please clarify if I am mistaken. If that is the case, it is likely that you would have to fight for any unemployment benefits you are otherwise entitled to in an administrative hearing as the company is likely to contest your claim that you were not fired for good cause.This also means that if you seek new employment that they will give you a bad reference to someone who inquires about your employment (although many HR departments are afraid to do that for fear of defamation liability and will only confirm the dates of your employment and your position).Wrongful Termination LawsuitsSeparate and apart from unemployment benefits, if you are fired, not just without cause, but for an illegal reasons (e.g. race, sex, and select statutory prohibited reasons), you may bring a wrongful termination lawsuit. Some of those reasons (firings related to discrimination by a private sector employer) require you to file an EEOC complaint and have it investigated by them first, other of those reasons (mostly whistle blowing statutes and breaches of written employment contracts that don't allow for termination of employment without cause) allow you to immediately bring suit for wrongful termination.The legal status of firing someone because you complained about another employee's ethical violation depends upon the exact nature of the ethical violation. For example, a U.S. Supreme Court case decided this month (i.e. February\/March 2018) held that whistle blower protections under U.S. securities laws apply to people who report securities fraud to the SEC, but not to people who report securities fraud to a supervisor in the company.My fellow employee was a lying asshole who acted unprofessionally (in non-technical sense of the word), and I complained about this conduct to my supervisor and the employer didn't care standing alone, would not normally constitute conduct that is covered by a whistle blowing statute that could allow you to bring a lawsuit for wrongful termination of employment, although it might constitute a constructive termination for bad cause by an employer (if you quit) or termination for bad cause by an employer (if you were fired) for unemployment insurance purposes.The legal theory behind the amount of damages that can be awarded in a wrongful termination lawsuit is a bit obscure. As a rule of thumb, six months wages is a pretty typical settlement amount in a wrongful termination case prior to a determination by a court of employer liability. At trial, there is wide variation in what juries award in wrongful termination lawsuits involving similar facts. Sometimes the award is minimal even when the jury finds that the employer wrongfully fired you, and sometimes the award is very substantial, amounting to many years of lost income in amount.Contractual Payment ObligationsGenerally speaking, unless a written contract provides otherwise, you have no obligation to return a hiring bonus and the employer has a contractual duty (and probably a statutory one as well) to pay you through the date of termination without deduction for a hiring bonus paid.This includes any amounts, including bonuses, that the employer was obligated to pay you, although proving an entitlement to a bonus can be difficult unless that standard for receiving one is clearly defined and you clearly met those standards as a factual matter. Sometimes, you can even win a breach of contract award for a bonus that was not yet fully earned if the only reason that the bonus was not awarded was the employer's bad faith conduct.You could sue to collect unpaid wages in a Justice Court (the limited jurisdiction court for small claims in Texas) if necessary, if the amount you are claiming is under $10,000. If you have a claim for unpaid wages in a larger amount or also have other damages, you would need to bring suit in the appropriate county court or district court, depending upon the amount claimed."}

(p.116)When Jackson gave the interviews, he violated the  because the appeals process was not yet complete and he was still on the case. As such, he created the image, that he might not be impartial:Canon 3A(6). The admonition against public comment about the merits of a pending or impending matter continues until the appellate process is complete. If the public comment involves a case from the judges own court, the judge should take particular care so that the comment does not denigrate public confidence in the judiciarys integrity and impartiality, which would violate Canon 2A. A judge may comment publicly on proceedings in which the judge is a litigant in a personal capacity, but not on mandamus proceedings when the judge is a litigant in an official capacity (but the judge may respond in accordance with Fed. R. App. P. 21(b)).Jackson did not appear as he was to be heard in the Circuit Court. As shown above, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals found, he did violate the code of conduct and disqualified him under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). While this did suffice to overturn the verdict prescribed by Jackson, the court did not throw out the findings of fact that had been issued well before the interviews and noted that the traditional setup might be inadequate for this case. They remanded back to a different judge to decide a remedy under a different scope.The case didn't end there, Microsoft attempted to get even the findings of fact thrown out based on the very ruling that sent it back for remand, claiming that the judge had shown to be biased way earlier, during the trial and before the finding of facts.

{"question":"Prompted by , the story of a woman suing herself came to my attention.Suit yourself: Utah court lets woman sue herself over fatal wreckA Utah woman will be the plaintiff and the defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit that has legal experts scratching their heads.Barbara Bagley was driving her family's Range Rover Dec. 27, 2011 on Interstate 80 near Battle Mountain, Nev., when it slid on sagebrush on Interstate 80, and flipped. Her husband, Bradley Vom Baur, was sent flying from the vehicle, suffered major injuries and died nearly two weeks later in a hospital, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Bagley, 48, suffered a concussion, broken ribs, a shattered wrist and two punctured lungs.

She is basically admitting she caused the death of her husband through negligence. From a legal perspective, seems pretty straight forward to me.Indeed, if she sues herself in a civil case for negligence (resulting in death of another), doesn't she automatically have to admit the guilt, and wouldn't \/ shouldn't she be immediately charged for manslaughter by the state?","answer":"The burden for proving claims in civil actions is ',' i.e., merely that 'more than 50% of the evidence favors a conclusion.'However, the standard for conviction of any crime is 'beyond a reasonable doubt.'

You can also break your own confidentiality and talk to the prosecutor yourself. The prosecutor's response is up to the prosecutor; however, they tend to not be super excited about giving immunity to a witness for the defense if they might want to prosecute the witness later (and courts often are fine with that), so the more they suspect about your true role the less likely they are to grant it. No. If the feds later find truly independent evidence (they have the burden of showing it's truly independent), they can prosecute. Some states give transactional immunity to witnesses (you can't be prosecuted for crimes you testified about for any reason), but the Fifth Amendment doesn't require it and at least the feds aren't bound by state transactional immunity. It's hard to prosecute, but is possible if prosecutors play their cards right. Yes, it does allow civil liability. There is no right against self-incrimination in civil matters, only criminal liability. If the forced testimony leads to a lawsuit that bankrupts you, too bad. "}

My understanding is that with the 'even if' coming later, it basically means the same thing even if without the 'otherwise'. Am I correct or wrong in this context? ","answer":"The 'even if' clause might be removable and the interpretation would be the same, though without the full context it's hard to say. The crucial question is whether US resident are not eligible for the benefit but non-residents who meet qualifications A, B, C are. If the rule is that you have be a non-resident A,B,C, then 'even if' means that becoming a US resident does not make you non-qualified."}

There is no special license required. The parent may use sound judgement in selecting the caretaker. Nor does a caretaker even have to be an adult -- teens are often used as baby sitters.If a reasonable parent would have known that a particular person was not a safe caretaker, then selecting that person might be negligence or child endangerment. Nor is there any legal requirement in most US states that a child be under anyone's direct supervision at all times. See . Again, if in particular circumstances a reasonable parent should know that supervision is needed, failure to provide it might be child neglect or endangerment. Some US states set minimum ages for children to be unsupervised. NJ is not one, to the best of my understanding."}

I was speaking with a vendor about X IT related services and after vetting out several vendors, another vendor of whom I have an existing relationship with informed us that they too offer the service we're looking for.A respectable colleague of mine warned me that I have to be careful because If I choose to move forward with the vendor of whom I have an existing relationship with, that we CAN NOT let the other vendor know or else they could sue for us choosing to go with the existing vendor and not giving other vendors a chance.How accurate is that statement? Can a vendor really sue us for choosing another vendor of whom we have an existing relationship with?","answer":"Any company can sue you for any reason whatsoever. What you describe doesn't give any indication that they could sue you successfully, but they can sue you. As a company, you are free to use any vendor that you like. If that colleague of yours is right, and the second company has a reputation of suing for stupid reasons or with no reason whatsoever, then he may very well be right and it may be best to avoid any contact with them. In the end, a pointless lawsuit that never had a chance to win is still going to cost your company time and money. On the other hand, if your colleague makes this up and is trying to destroy their reputation (for example because a relative is boss of the first vendor), they might have a real reason to sue your colleague.

{"question":"I am a college student (USA) from State A and go to college in State B. Last September I registered to vote in State A as an absentee voter. I voted in a local election but never got the ballot for the primary election. Last June I received a jury duty notice at my parent's house (state A), to which they responded by saying I had moved and gave my apartment address in State B. My permanent address is still my parent's place, as is my driver's license address and passport address. Am I still eligible to vote in State A? Is it illegal to register to vote in State B unless I go through some process?","answer":"To vote in a state, you must be a resident of that state. While attending school out of state does not terminate your legal residency in A, establishing residency in B does. If you want to vote in B, become a resident and register in B; if you want to remain a resident of A and vote in A, don't do that.Establishing residency in B generally boils down to intending to reside in B for more than a temporary period. I suspect that most states do not have a universal definition of resident, so for example in Washington, each agency has its criteria for residency. To register to vote, you have to be a legal resident and live at the address for 30 days (prior to the next election). One way to establish residency is getting a drivers license, which has a , you have to live in a permanent place of abode in the state for 90 days. There are a number of ways to show that: use a Washington address for federal taxes; run for public office or use a Washington address for some court papers; be a custodial parent of a child attending school in the state; register to vote, have a driver's license; register a vehicle in the state. The suicide law restricts the right to medical suicide to residents, proof of which includes (is not limited to) having a Washington driver's license (which is not the same as a state ID card), being registered to vote, or owning \/ leasing property in the state.There is a , you have to have moved to the state for reasons other than tuition, and you have to have been here at least a year. Ohio similarly has an agency-by-agency approach to residency. If you exclude financial benefits and focus on drivers license or state ID and voter registration, you can probably make a reasonable guess as to the requirements. There is no official registration or form to fill out to become a resident (as far as I know, in any state), so the law will say what could constitute evidence that you are a resident. It may come down to intending to reside for an indefinite period in B."}

{"question":"Also, what is the difference between a foreigner marrying a green card holder vs a citizen of the US?","answer":"Short AnswerIf a foreigner marries a green card holder in the US, will theforeigner also be entitled to a green card at some point?Yes. In theory. Congress can, however, change the system by legislation before someone gets a visa that they have applied for at any time, which could prevent some applicants from ever receiving a visa.what is the difference between a foreigner marrying a green cardholder vs a citizen of the US?Someone marrying a citizen of the U.S. has a higher priority that is not subject to categorical or country based quotas. This means that :If your spouse is a U.S. citizen and you currently live in the UnitedStates, it takes on average 11-20 months to get a marriage-based greencard. Spouses of U.S. citizens living in the United States can filetheir I-130 and their I-485 at the same time.If your spouse is a U.S. citizen and you currently live outside theUnited States, it takes on average 7.5-13.5 months to get amarriage-based green card.A foreigner marrying a green card holder is subject to both categorical and country based quotas which can greatly delay the processing of their application, but, in theory, will eventually cause a lawful permanent resident visa to be issued to the foreigner seeking to marry the lawful permanent resident. The delay is especially long if the foreigner is from Mexico or the Philippines.According to :The total processing time for obtaining a marriage based green cardwhen one spouse is a permanent resident and the other is a foreignnational seeking a green card, both living in the U.S., ranges from29-38 months. (the same one used for the delays for U.S. citizen spouses), however, states:Spouses of green card holders will have to wait for a green card tobecome available after their sponsor files form I-130 and before theycan apply for a green card from either within the United States or ata U.S. consulate abroad. In most cases, it takes about two years for agreen card to become available, and the entire process takes aroundthree years. It can take slightly longer for citizens of Mexico,China, India, and the Philippines.If your spouse is a green card holder and you currently live in theUnited States, then you will wait about 11-20 months to receive yourgreen card.If your spouse is a green card holder and you currently live outsidethe United States, then you will wait about 13.5-35.5 months toreceive your green card.Long Answer<h3>Overview<\/h3>This answer provides an overview of the overall U.S. immigration system for green cards and otherwise, because it is easier to understand immigration in the specific category asked about in the context of the overall picture.Overall, the U.S. grants  lawful permanent resident visas (a.k.a. green cards) under several distinct priority systems, some of which have quotas and some of which do not. It also grants a great many temporary visas.( for the images above)<h3>Family Based Immigration<\/h3>The biggest single category of these lawful permanent resident visas are granted based upon a family relationship with a current U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.The number of lawful permanent resident applications that can be granted each year on the basis of family relationship other than being immediate relatives of U.S. citizens is limited a quota of about 480,000 visas a year created by U.S. immigration law and there is a priority system for those applications. In fiscal year 2021:A total of 757,206 petitions to establish a family relationship with aU.S. citizen or green card holder (Form I-130) were received inFY2021, with a steep uptick in quarters three and four (USCIS received149,173; 148,039; 243,753; and 216,241 petitions in quarters 1 through4, respectively). Overall, denials of I-130 petitions fell in FY2021to just under 11 percent.USCIS received 300,162 adjustment of status applications on Form I-485in FY2020, but only 288,668 in FY2021. The agency approved 266,080applications, a significant increase from the approval of 229,676 seenthe year before. In further good news, 44,181 applications were deniedin FY2021, down from 53,032 denials last year.However, this progress was not enough to make a meaningful dent in thefamily-based I-485 backlog, which stands at 349,350 pending cases atthe close of FY2021  a 52% increase over FY2020. Current estimatesplace the family-based green card backlog  including the USCIS andDepartment of State green card backlogs  at 1.6 million.A spouse of a lawful permanent resident of the United States (a.k.a. a green card holder) is eligible to apply to be a lawful permanent resident of the United States on that basis, and so in a spouse of a U.S. citizen. ()If you are the spouse, minor child or parent of a U.S. citizen, this application can be granted to these people who count as  without considering the quotas established by U.S. immigration law for other kinds of lawful permanent resident applications based upon family relationships.In  there are five different layers of priority, a spouse of a lawful permanent resident has second priority after the unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens:First preference (F1) - unmarried sons and daughters (21 years of ageand older) of U.S. citizens;Second preference (F2A) - spouses and children (unmarried and under 21 years of age) of lawful permanent residents;Second preference (F2B) - unmarried sons and daughters (21 years ofage and older) of lawful permanent residents;Third preference (F3) - married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens;andFourth preference (F4) - brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens (if theU.S. citizen is 21 years of age and older)Country Quotas And BacklogsIn addition to those priority categories there are also priorities and quotas within the overall allowed family immigration visa quota based upon the applicants' countries of origin.For the capped preference categories in the family and employmentstreams, U.S. law imposes a limit on how many immigrants from anyparticular country can receive green cards in a given year. Under theper-country cap set in the Immigration Act of 1990, no country canreceive more than 7 percent of the total number of employment-basedand family-sponsored preference visas in a given year. There are noper-country limits for uncapped categories, such as immediaterelatives of U.S. citizens.Because of the numerical caps and per-country caps on certaingreen-card categories, there are significant waits for somecategories, with sharper effects on a few countries. For example, asof April 2019, the wait for U.S. citizens to sponsor adult, unmarriedchildren was more than seven years for most parts of the world, butwas 12 years for relatives from the Philippinesand more than 21 yearsfor those from Mexico. As of November 2018, there were 3.7 millionpeople waiting in line abroad for a family-sponsored green card, and121,000 awaiting an employment-sponsored green card.()Thus, a lawful permanent resident's spouse applying to become a lawful permanent resident needs to be able to fit in both a quota for their visa priority level and also a quota for their country of origin. These combined quotas often give rise to large backlogs, especially for immigrants from Mexico and the Philippines.<h3>Non-Family Based Green Cards<\/h3>There are also more than half a dozen other major categories of grounds upon which someone can apply for lawful permanent residence status in addition to a family relationship with a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent residence of the U.S.Some of the main other categories of lawful permanent residence visa applications are those based upon ordinary employment (about 140,000 a year), employment as a religious worker or journalist, those based upon refugee, asylum, crime or abuse victim status, connections to services done for the U.S. military in Afghanistan or Iraq or in NATO, diversity visa lottery winners (about 55,000 a year), and a host of other  that have accumulated on an ad hoc basis over time.The priorities and quotas for lawful permanent resident visas granted on these other grounds are more or less independent of the priorities and quotas that apply to applications for lawful permanent residence status based upon a family connection to someone who is already a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.For example:There were 45,897 applications for employment-based green cardssubmitted to USCIS in the final quarter of FY2021, a dramatic increasefrom the 26,433 applications received during the same period lastyear. In total, USCIS approved 161,438 employment green cards, a1,077% increase from 13,709 the previous year.Employment-based green card backlogs in particular have become anunfortunate fixture of the U.S. immigration system, largely due toregulations that cap the number of immigrant visas (green cards)issued to citizens of any one nation, as well as the overall greencard caps put in place by Congress that were discussed earlier. Bylaw, USCIS can issue up to 140,000 employment-based green cards eachyear, plus any unused family green cards from the previous year.As a result of the steep decline in family-based green cards issuedduring FY2020 discussed above, 122,000 family-preference visas wentunused and were added to the 2021 cap on employment-based visas, whichraised the total available to 262,000.Due to administrative processing backlogs and other paperwork snafus, however, about 200,000 available visas under the quotes have not been used in recent years.The predominant source for the visa related statistics above which are not otherwise attributed is .<h3>Temporary Visas<\/h3>In addition to lawful permanent resident visa, the U.S. also issued a wide variety of other temporary visas, some of which, like vistor's visas from countries with whom the U.S. has a favorable immigration relationship and student visa, are granted almost as a matter of course, and others of which, like H1-B technology worker visas, are extremely scarce and hard to obtain.<h3>Change In Status Considerations<\/h3>Special rules apply to transitioning from one kind of visa to another and to the treatment of undocumented immigrants who seek to obtain lawful immigrant status with an appropriate visa (particularly a subset of the applicants in the  (DACA) program)."}

{"question":"Specifically, could Silicon Valley Bank sue the Founders Fund and other VCs that had companies they invested in withdraw their funds?Has any bank ever successfully done this?To clarify, I'm not asking about the act of withdrawing funds, but encouraging others to do so.","answer":"Can a bank sue someone that starts a bank run that destroys the bank?No (assuming, of course, as is the usual case, that the person who starts the bank run is not engaged in perpetrating a defamatory falsehood).Most bank runs are, and certainly the Silicon Valley Bank bank run was, based upon wide disclosure of a true fact. In the case of SVB, the bank run was triggered by the fact that its balance sheets failed to reflect the true value of fixed nominal rate bonds that it held as assets.In the usual case, a lawsuit also isn't a very helpful option to a bank that suffers a bank run. In the case of SVB, the bank had a book value (which is often a fair measure of a bank's value since its assets are so monetized) of $34 billion which was reduced to a pittance by the run on it. Even if someone who started a run on the bank had a moderately high net worth of $3.4 million that could be collected in a money judgment, that would cover a mere 0.01% of the loss to the bank, and there would be serious issues over the causation of any loss (i.e. how much of the losses suffered bound to occur sooner or later anyway due to causes unrelated to someone who triggered a panic).Another fine point of procedure is that when a bank becomes insolvent, it is promptly taken over by the FDIC or similar regulatory agency, which installs a receiver. This makes it effectively impossible for the bank itself to sue anyone. If the bank would otherwise have had a right to sue, the receiver for the bank would have the right to sue rather than the bank itself. But, this subtly while not irrelevant, doesn't capture the core reason for the question."}
{"question":"Alan Dershowwitz argues that a conviction of any President by the US Senate would be unconstitutional under certain circumstances. Please see his book and his television interviews for those certain circumstances that he argues would create a unconstitutional conviction.However the circumstances that he puts forward are not what prompts me to ask the question above.  Generally US citizens expect the judiciary to be the arbiter of constitutionality, with the US Supreme Court to be the final arbiter of in the event of an appeal. So, are US Senate impeachment convictions reviewable by the judiciary and or the Supreme CourtIn the event that the answer to the title question is 'yes', have any impeachment convictions been reviewed by the Supreme Court?","answer":"The only relevant case heard by SCOTUS is , 506 U.S. 224, where a federal judge was tried and convicted for actual crimes, but would not resign his position so continued to draw his salary. The key legal question was whether the matter is 'justiciable' (meaning, not a political matter but a legal matter). Nixon's argument was that Senate Rule XI violates the Impeachment Trial Clause, and the court held that the question (more specifically what it means to 'try') is nonjusticiable. White &amp; Blackmun, and Souter, wrote concurring opinions (which might be called on in a subsequent impeachment case) that reminds the reader (and future court) what was not part of the holding of the court, and what might therefore allow future impeachment review. White writes  The Court is of the view that the Constitution forbids us even to  consider his contention. I find no such prohibition and would  therefore reach the merits of the claim. I concur in the judgment  because the Senate fulfilled its constitutional obligation to 'try'  petitioner.He observes that   the Senate has very wide discretion in specifying impeachment trial  procedures and because it is extremely unlikely that the Senate would  abuse its discretion and insist on a procedure that could not be  deemed a trial by reasonable judges.But,  I would prefer not to announce an unreviewable discretion in the  Senate to ignore completely the constitutional direction to 'try'  impeachment cases. When asked at oral argument whether that direction  would be satisfied if, after a House vote to impeach, the Senate,  without any procedure whatsoever, unanimously found the accused guilty  of being 'a bad guy,' counsel for the United States answered that the  Government's theory 'leads me to answer that question yes.' Tr. of  Oral Arg. 51. Especially in light of this advice from the Solicitor  General, I would not issue an invitation to the Senate to find an  excuse, in the name of other pressing business, to be dismissive of  its critical role in the impeachment process.Souter in his opinion states that  One can, nevertheless, envision different and unusual circumstances  that might justify a more searching review of impeachment proceedings.  If the Senate were to act in a manner seriously threatening the  integrity of its results, convicting, say, upon a coin toss, or upon a  summary determination that an officer of the United States was simply'  'a bad guy,'', judicial interference might well be appropriate. In  such circumstances, the Senate's action might be so far beyond the  scope of its constitutional authority, and the consequent impact on  the Republic so great, as to merit a judicial response despite the  prudential concerns that would ordinarily counsel silence.In other words, review of an impeachment is largely but not entirely off the table, at least until SCOTUS declares that impeachments are completely unreviewable, no matter what, period (unlikely to ever happen)."}

To me, various articles in this convention seem to be at odds with the constitution clause.For instance, ICERD article 5, clause (c) reads (emphasis mine):In compliance with the fundamental obligations laid down in article 2 of this Convention, States Parties undertake to prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of the following rights: [...] Political rights, in particular the right to participate in elections-to vote and to stand for election-on the basis of universal and equal suffrage, to take part in the Government as well as in the conduct of public affairs at any level and to have equal access to public service; Regardless of the original intent of the convention, it seems to me that the quoted US Constitution clause distinguishes citizens by national\/ethnic origin when it comes to the political right of participating in Government, and thereby violates this article of the ICERD.Am I misunderstanding something about treaties in this case? Is the quoted clause from the US Constitution compatible with the ICERD?","answer":"One might think that.

{"question":"Does the  of civilians?","answer":"Not in US courts. It would be more accurate to say the UDHR overrides nothing and is not US law. It is a nonbinding UN General Assembly resolution; while it is very powerful persuasive authority and much is customary international law, it is persuasive authority only. See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692. The US has ratified the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which unlike the UDHR is a treaty, meaning that is a legal obligation for the US. However, the ratification was subject to many reservations and declarations, whose net effect is that the ICCPR is not in and of itself enforceable in US courts.  The US considers the US Constitution to provide the rights in question, and basically assumes no further obligations. Even if it was possible to enforce the ICCPR in US court directly, Reid v. Covert established that the Constitution overrides treaties in US court. While as a matter of international law treaties override domestic law, this is not necessarily enforceable in domestic court.

{"question":"Seven US states have . Two other states previously had such laws.How frequently, if at all, are these laws enforced or have previously been enforced, whether by forcing changes in schools or by punishing violators? I'm skeptical the laws are ever enforced because (a) I can't readily find news reports of anybody being prosecuted, and (b) several of the laws require teachers to tell students that gay sex is illegal, although it is actually legal throughout the US since Lawrence v. Texas (2003).","answer":"School districts \/ states do generally have the power to set the curriculum including the viewpoint that will be officially conveyed. One  for one instantiation. In this case, the teacher assigned various books, including Heather Has Two Mommies, one of the books that prompted an outcry. The upshot of that case is that a teacher cannot invoke the First Amendment to override policy.This article (, annoying footnote structure) reviews the topic, and section III covers prior cases. It notes that the cases of Lawrence, Windsor, Obergefell do not address the constitutionality of these education laws, though the reasoning in the prior cases might be applicable if there were a suit over curriculum. There is an implication that some of these rules have been enforced in the past, but most of the evidence is in the form of news stories (Beall v. London City School BOE is not available in the open). The article does engage in a somewhat deeper study of enforcement in Utah, where it was enforced (until it was repealed).Enforcement is necessarily indirect. The law require school districts to have a particular curriculum; violation would come when an individual teacher taught contrary to the prescribed curriculum. Those laws do not contain any provision like 'a teacher who violates these rules gets fired', instead, punishment is via the general rule that you have to teach what is in the state-mandated curriculum. Rather than officially terminating a teacher for violating this curricular guideline, districts use vague reasons for non-renewal such as 'due  to  problems  with communication and teamwork' (from Evans-Marshall).

They also prohibit the user from giving anyone the document files without applying that same restriction to the receiver.Are those terms really legitimate?","answer":"Copyright lawCopyright law , much of which is codified in the Copyright Act of 1976This law operates by protecting software companies, mostly growing out of the United States jurisdiction, who effectively license users to use the software in accordance with copyright law, with no ownership of the software itself granted. Further, to implement Digital Restrictions Management, their licenses restrict the usage of their software.Digital Restrictions Management (better known as Digital Rights Management) is a technique that is applied by companies for some file formats, i.e to prohibit users from opening proprietary file formats in other software.It is also accompanied by contractual or license restrictions that limit users from accessing the content in such files and from sharing it illegally.This technique was traditionally made for content which is used in distribution channels for example, Adobe Digital Editions prevents file owners from accessing .acsm files and it is used for implementing DRM in publishers' contracts with libraries with restrictions imposed on their patrons on copying or distributing copies.InteroperabilityA natural consequence of restricting users from accessing published content is to also disallow interoperability which can remove the lock on the digital content itself. While Adobe uses DRM in its distribution channel,  of their software products and works made using those products.Legal treatment of DRM and interoperabilityThe Digital Millenium Copyright Act . However, as regards interoperability, the Act itself provides an exception under which computer programmers are allowed to reverse engineer a DRM product to provide for interoperability.What this means for you is, regardless of the software licensing terms, you are still entitled to break the DRM lock for the purposes of achieving interoperability as holding otherwise would defeat public policy in the United States, considering that,In Vault Corp. v.

{"question":"This was inspired by the title of the following:but in this situation, we make the crime actually pretend. Suppose you are good at sleight of hand, i.e. dextrous illusion-making like a magician. Using a product or good you actually own that looks to an outsider's eyes just like one in the store, but which you've marked in a discreet place so you are assured you don't accidentally actually take the one that isn't yours, and using your magician skills, you make it look like you were pocketing the wares when you actually didn't. To security, and to the limited resolution on a surveillance camera, it looks like a theft, and the police are called.What happens? Even if the illusionary nature is eventually discovered and proven (e.g. if the store keeps suitable inventory records which they can cross-check with transaction logs and they do and find that no items are unaccounted for), does the mere fact of having \"hoaxed\" the crime itself constitute some kind of crime in at least the same common-law jurisdictions? Could you be charged with something oblique like \"wasting police time\" or something? Could someone be charged with that? Even if none of that, would you still stand a strong chance to be successfully convicted of theft directly (albeit de facto wrongfully, but still), because someone could always claim you switched the items and it'd be your word against theirs that that mark was on the one you owned and not the one you didn't, and the injustices of unequal bargaining power would work against you?","answer":"I cant think of any laws against pretending to commit a crime, per se.  For example, undercover police officers often pretend to buy or sell illicit goods, to see who will take them up on the offer.However, pretending to commit some crimes could be a crime.  if you intentionally pretend to be violent or unstable, and this puts another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact, that could be common assault."}

And for a bit of extra money they will forward my parcel from their store to me in Russia.I was thinking about using these services. But this all sounds really strange to me. The delivery is possible in some shops of U.S. straight to Russia, but not in others. UPS and DHL may or may not ship into Russia depending on contracts and other details.Are forwarder companies like this legal?","answer":"Yes they are legalBrokers who carry or forward freight to other countries are very common.  This is an example of that.  This is done not just in the US but across the globe.  These companies might move the freight in bulk to the destination country and induct it into that country's parcel systems or they may just be performing the service of shipping it internationally when a domestic company chooses not to.  Some of these companies might also accept payment from foreign sources that the selling company doesn't accept.There are companies who would prefer not to deal with freight forwarders because their customers no longer have the ability to easily return their items and can get mad about it.  The primary reason companies do not want to ship internationally is fraud and theft. Customs is troublesome as well when customers don't understand their country's rules, which often involve large tariffs that must be paid at the destination country.  Shipping internationally is also just harder, with additional paperwork and government requirements.The brokers performing this service meet the legal requirements for exporting\/importing and thus run afoul of no laws."}
{"question":"Imagine a situation where an employer offers an employee a contract that stipulates that all disputes should be resolved by some arbitration panel in a tax haven. I don't know about America but I am pretty sure that most\/all Western European courts would ignore such a clause and apply the local labour laws in case of a dispute because it would be considered unreasonable that a strong part (the employer) could force a weak part (the employee) to enter a contract that favoured the strong part (it is usually very expensive and difficult to engage a arbitration panel in a foreign country).Another similar situation would be that a big company, like Apple or Google, in their terms and conditions for a consumer service prescribed that all disputes should be resolved as in the previous example. Again, I think most courts would ignore such a clause and instead apply the local consumer laws for the same reasons as in the previous example.A third example could be parents and their minor children. I have some difficulties coming up with a good example but say that a grandparent willed a large amount of money to a minor grand child and that in the current jurisdiction A, the parent's aren't allowed to access this money. The parents therefore decide to move to another country B that allows them free access to their children's money (and waste it while the child still is a minor).Finally the child returns to A and seeks compensation. I reckon a court in A would apply A's laws to the situation and conclude that the move to B benefited the parents in an extremely one-sided and unfair way since the child had no means to object to the decision to move, and as a consequnce was robbed on her\/his money.If the situation had been a married couple (or soon-to-be married couple) where one party X had a lot of money that the other party Y had no access to in A but free access to in B and the couple voluntarily and consensually moved from A to B, I doubt that X could seek compensation from Y for spending the money because they are both adults with full legal rights and responsibilities and if they decide to marry and live in B rather than A, X can't afterwards return to A and demand that the courts in A should overrule the laws in B.The third example(s) is quite artificial so no need to nitpick on details...But back to the question. If I generalize the examples above there is one strong party and one weak party. The strong party, more or less, forces the weak party to enter an agreement that heavily benefits the strong party. Such a contract would in many cases not be upheld by a court because it is considered unfair.

The strong party, more or less, forces the weak party toenter an agreement that heavily benefits the strong party. Such acontract would in many cases not be upheld by a court because it isconsidered unfair. Is this principle called something?The main principle you are trying to articulate is . But the bar to invoke that doctrines is very, very high. Generally speaking, no amount of stronger bargaining power argument will prevail in a case where a contract or other legal instrument established a forum, if the parties signing are competent to enter into contracts or execute legal instruments, and the legal documents are in a language that they can read.I have seen these kinds of terms upheld in circumstances much more extreme than those in the OP.Another kindred doctrine is called economic duress, but claims of economic duress almost always fail.The typical unconscionability fact pattern involves a grossly unfair substantive term coupled with some sort of deceit hiding an unrelated and unexpected term in a contract of adhesion (e.g. a shrink wrap agreement that signs over your first born child in the event that you make an unauthorized copy of the software), by using tiny print that can't be seen (for example, an online agreement that is black on black and can only be read in source code), by using a language not known to the person and misrepresenting in the translation what the challenged term says, or by manipulating someone who is a minor or feeble minded into agreeing to something.Duress is typically available in cases, for example, of threatened physical force applied to someone or threatened illegal actions. It is usually overlapping with criminal extortion.There are specific terms of agreements that can be void as against public policy on a per se basis (e.g. a waiver of claims for conduct of the other party intentionally harming you, or liquidated damages that don't reasonable approximate expected harm ex ante or don't reflect a situation where actual damages are hard to determine, interest rates above statutory usury rates, conditioning an inheritance on divorcing your current spouse, fee tail estates in real property in some jurisdiction, prenups resolving in advance child custody between coparent spouses), but there aren't many of them and the ones you mention aren't among them."}

{"question":"I write reviews of books and other materials for a scholarly journal. Printed books I receive are traditionally marked as review copies in order to prevent them to be sold on the used books market, but never have I seen the demand to delete my paper copy upon reviewing.Increasingly, the books are sent not as paper versions, but as electronic files, such as a PDF attached to an email. For most of the materials I receive for reviewing, there is an accompanying notice that says that the copy may only be used for the purpose of reviewing and not shared with others, which is fine with me. However, some of the materials (depending on the book publisher) come with a notice that demands that I must delete the electronic review copy once finished writing my review.This I find places an unreasonable burden upon me. I would certainly prefer to ignore the journal's stipulation to delete the review copy. My arguments for considering it void are:(1) I generally find said stipulation to be stated in the same email that contains the review copy as attachment. By the time I have read the clause, already several copies, including automated backup copies, will have been made of the review copy on several mail servers and backup servers, which are not completely under my control. Making sure to delete all these copies places an onerous and potentially unfulfillable burden upon me. To reject the contract for being impractical and putting me in legal jeopardy would at this point entail having to perform the very act that I feel incapable to perform: the reliable deletion of all copies of an email attachment that has been sent to me. Hence the clause would put me into an infringement trap. It must therefore be void under these circumstances.(2) Traditionally, reviewers in academia get to keep review copies for their personal reference. This makes sense, not least because the review itself becomes a published work of its own, which is open to public scrutiny. If, e.g., someone in a letter to the editor of the journal criticized my review to be inaccurate (or perhaps even defamatory), having lost access to the review copy might render it difficult, if not impossible, for me to answer to such criticism of my own work (or to wage a veracity defense against libel charges against me). The ability to defend my own work in any case establishes my legitimate interest in keeping the review copy within my reach. Disallowing this does not only breach with long-established custom in academic publishing, but also infringes upon my ability to preserve my reputation, including by making it potentially impossible to exercise my right to obtain and adduce evidence against libel charges. Therefore, I believe I can ignore the stipulation to delete on fair use grounds.A place of jurisdiction is not stated anywhere in my agreements with the journal; in the case I have in mind, the book publisher is US-based, the journal is published in some European country, while I, the reviewer, may reside anywhere in the world.As a reviewer, I do not know the contract that the book publisher has made with the journal. It appears likely that the book publisher has granted the journal permission to use the electronic files only for the purpose of review and demands it to delete the copies it keeps after finishing the reviewing process. Let us further assume that this contract is silent on how to deal with copies prepared for and transmitted to reviewers.","answer":"The (journal) publisher's interest is presumably to comply with conditions imposed by the copyright owner: CUP might demand of Elsevier that their reviewers delete electronic copies of books after the review is finished. In keeping and using the work (and perhaps freely distributing that copy), you have violated CUP's copyright (assume that CUP holds the copyright). Therefore you can be sued. Elsevier can also be sued. What is not clear is how many people can sue you (and whether you can sue anyone).It would depend on whether you were informed of the deletion requirement before you agreed to review the work. If you were led to believe either that you would get a paper copy of the work, or at least would be able to retain and use the electronic copy for your own use, the journal publisher does not have the option of rewriting the terms of that agreement after the fact. If you reasonably relied on them granting you permission to keep the work, they can't sue you. You might even be able to sue them, insofar as getting a free copy of an expensive book in exchange of writing a review is a standard academic business deal. On the other hand, if they told you in advance that you'd have to delete the review copy, then that is the end of the discussion. If you didn't read the agreement, that too is the end of the discussion.It is not clear what recourse the rights holder might have against you. You have no contractual relationship with the book publisher, and the journal publisher is not the agent of the book publisher so the book publisher is not bound by the errors of the journal publisher. Because you are expected to know that all IP requires permission of the rights holder to copy and since you know that the journal publisher is not the copyright holder, you are on thin ice in assuming that the copyright holder has granted you permission to copy the work. Indeed, even agreeing to review a work in electronic form is a dubious proposition, without suitable legal assurances that the rights holder has granted permission to make the required copies. If a journal buys a physical copy of a book, it can lend or give it to you to write a review, and no permission is required wrong the book publisher. To review an electronic copy, permission from the book publisher is required. You might try defending yourself against an infringement suit under the fair use doctrine, since the underlying purpose of 'fair use' is precisely to allow book reviews.If the journal publisher was negligent in not informing you of the copyright conditions imposed on them (which they are supposed to impose on you), your infringement may be innocent, and you might only have a small liability. You could sue the journal in case the book publisher sues you  the journal publisher has a duty of care to you. Technically speaking, you're in trouble once you download the illegal copy, and technically speaking, you infringe copyright every time you read the work. Digital content is, or should be, distributed under some license (a contract between you and the rights holder), otherwise it is illegal to receive or use the work. Hence various public licenses grant permission to copy, subject to various limitations: the use may not be commercial; the work may not be redistributed; the work may not be altered; the work may not be redistributed in exchange for money, or some something of value... The teeth that digital licensing has is that if you copy and use a work contrary to the terms of the license, you do not have permission (the rights holder has granted conditional permission).Copyright law gives the rights holder the exclusive right to authorize making any copies, and in order to use a computer file, a number of copies are made (by various programs). The basic protection is that 'the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following: (1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords; (2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work'. Copies are statutorily defined as 'material objects, other than phonorecords, in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. The term copies includes the material object, other than a phonorecord, in which the work is first fixed.' One or more 'derivative works' (with no added creative content) are created in getting from a pdf file to a computer screen. In , Congress created an exception to general copyright protection, whereby one can make 'another copy or adaptation' of a computer program provided  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an  infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or  authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that computer  program provided:    (1) that such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step  in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a  machine and that it is used in no other manner, or    (2) that such new copy or adaptation is for archival purposes only and  that all archival copies are destroyed in the event that continued  possession of the computer program should cease to be rightful.This exception only covers computer programs, and not data files, and as the  says   You are not permitted under section 117 to make a backup copy of other  material on a computer's hard drive, such as other copyrighted works  that have been downloaded (e.g., music, films). It is also important  to check the terms of sale or license agreement of the original copy  of software in case any special conditions have been put in place by  the copyright owner that might affect your ability or right under  section 117 to make a backup copy. There is no other provision in the  Copyright Act that specifically authorizes the making of backup copies  of works other than computer programs even if those works are  distributed as digital copies.I say that 'technically', it is infringement if you open and process a digital file that you do not have permission to copy (via a license), because that is what the law says, and no court case has deemed that Congress intended something entirely different. It is notoriously difficult to establish legislative intent. Since Congress did articulate narrow exceptions in similar cases (computer programs, also  of performances and display of works, and did not include any exception for copies made by computer programs in the course of 'using' a protected work, but could have, we can conclude that Congress did not intend to create such an exception. One might point to other facts to argue that Congress did intend that. At present, I believe that the Supreme Court would uphold the letter of the law, but there is really only one way to find out.  That is, at any rate, the basis for the copyright holder pursuing an action against you (or, you and the journal).Even without any prior notification of a requirement to delete, they can still tell you that you must delete the work. They probably could not successfully force you to delete the work in a court of law, but there are many other things that they can do that boil down to the fact that you must delete that copy of the work. Blackballing, for example."}
{"question":"Which Supreme Court justices, present or historical, have ruled the most against intellectual property rights?","answer":"  Which Supreme Court justices, present or historical, have ruled the  most against intellectual property rights?In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of intellectual property rights, overturned more expansive rulings of the Federal Circuit, and overridden Patent and Trademark Office policies consistently. All but two the 26 U.S. Supreme Court rulings on the subject (pro or anti-IP holder) in the last 13 years (both in 2018) have either been unanimous or had only one dissenter (with no one consistent dissenting justices). The two 2018 cases with more than one dissenting justice, each involving the inter partes review of previously grated patents by the PTO under a new patent statute, implicate separation of powers and civil procedure issues that have historically been more controversial than pure intellectual property issues.

{"question":"Are state marriage records publicly accessible online? Is there a database (free or subscription-only) where such information can be found?","answer":"I believe they're public record throughout the United States, and available online for most of the United States.I don't know of any single, national repository for marriage records, so I'd recommend Googling around (e.g., 'California marriage records' or 'San Diego marriage records'). If you're looking for records from a jurisdiction (or time) that are not available online, you could also try using some of the free online genealogy resources, which make those records available. The LDS Church has a particularly powerful service, which, as I recall, will allow you to search for a person and even pull up a scanned copy of licenses that they have available."}
{"question":"In some jurisdictions one who rents a room in a landlord's own residence is considered less than a tenant and doesn't receive the same protections against illegal eviction, etc.It seems that this concept doesn't exist in Florida. Does anything like this exist either in Florida or in the rest of the US?","answer":"Anti-discrimination laws in the U.S. have exceptions for someone who rents a room in a landlord's own residence, but generally speaking, for other purposes, there is not a distinction in U.S. or Florida law.People who stay at a place with the permission of the owner for a very brief period of time and not pursuant to a lease, such as someone who gains use of a particular seat in a movie theater pursuant to a purchased ticket, is, however, not a tenant with the full rights of a tenant, and is instead a licensee who does not have a property right to use that space, only a contract that can be terminated by the property owner or their agent at will, potentially with breach of contract damages if this is done without justification, but not with liability for violating a tenant's rights.In some cases, someone whose housing, at least part of the time, is for the convenience of the employer, like a medical resident who uses a sleeping room at a hospital, or a member of the crew of a ship who sleeps on the ship incident to their duties, may have reduced rights relative to housing when their employment is terminated for cause, although this is only sometimes clearly enunciated in statutes or case law and the law would not be terribly consistent in this area."}
{"question":"I recently entered into a rental contract with a company for an excavator.  The contract period expired and they were supposed to pick up the equipment, but they have not yet picked it up (it has been one week).  I contacted them during this period, but they never returned my call.I know that when your car gets towed, often the towing company will not only bill you for the towing but will also bill you storage fees for each day you leave it on their premises; this seems to apply even though I never signed a contract to agree to those terms.  Can I do the same to the rental company?  I have their key, so they wouldn't be able to get their equipment back until I gave it to them.","answer":"An analogy to towing companies is tempting but misplaced, since towing is a statutorily-authorized and regulated activity (e.g. ). You therefore cannot just charge an arbitrary storage fee for uncollected equipment, and it is highly unlikely that there is any provision in the contract which authorizes you to charge for storage. The question is why you think you think they are responsible for picking up the excavator  presumably there is a clause in the contract that says that they will pick it up. Assuming that the contract doesn't say much, then your recourse would reside in the fact of their equipment trespassing on your property. You would need to officially withdraw permission for their equipment to be on your property (since you gave it in the first place). They would have a reasonable time to retrieve their goods, and if they don't do so, you would have a basis for suing them for damages. Also, the worst thing you could do is forcibly keeping their key until they pay you a storage fee: you'd need a court-ordered award, to get anything from them.The Connecticut towing law is . Note that in order to call a towing company to get the equipment towed (if that's even possible), there has to be 'conspicuous signage' warning of the possibility of towing 'on such private commercial property'; but an overriding consideration is that you may tow if the vehicle is left for forty-eight or more hours. Two points to be noted are that although the law refers to 'An owner or lessee of private property', the signage requirement implies that the property has to be commercial, not residential (this limitation to 'private commercial property' is repeated in the statute, indicating a legislative intent to restrict the legal towing permission to commercial property).The law refers to 'motor vehicles', but it is not clear whether an excavator counts as a 'motor vehicle' (defined in para  of the definitions section). Although an excavator is a 'vehicle propelled or drawn by any nonmuscular power', exceptions are carved out for agricultural tractors, farm implements, and 'and any other vehicle not suitable for operation on a highway', which I think reasonably means that an excavator is not a motor vehicle. So since the towing statute does not authorize towing of something that is not a motor vehicle, that would not seem to be an option in this case (even if there were signage, and this is commercial property).And calling a towing company would only get the item removed from your property, but would not authorize you to collect a storage fee (the towing company can only do so after the police have been notified, which they must do withing 2 hours)."}

Am I missing something here, or are his actions indeed a violation of federal law?","answer":"Probably notThere's a difference between knowing DeJoy is guilty, and proving he is guilty. The first is a matter of your personal views on epistemology; the second is a matter of law.The statute says an official cannot use his official authority for the purpose of interfering with...In other words, in order to charge DeJoy, the government needs evidence that he is making these changes for the purpose of interfering with the election. According to news reports, DeJoy claims his purpose is legitimate: To balance the USPS budgets. He claims the PO is losing so much money that drastic cuts are required unless Congress increases funding.Given that the USPS is running a deficit, it will very hard to prove that DeJoy's explanation is just a smokescreen, that his real purpose is to screw up the election.

{"question":"Could  (the controversial abortion law) be nullified by a declaratory judgement?Suppose a would-be abortion provider were to file suit against Texas Right To Life, who are running the  website, arguing that SB8 is an effective ban on abortion and hence unconstitutional, and suppose that the court agrees and grants a declaratory judgement saying so.This would block Texas Right To Life from suing an abortion provider under SB8, but it wouldn't stop any John or Jane Doe from suing, because they were not parties to the original suit.Suppose there is a subsequent suit by John Doe against Planned Parenthood for an abortion in Texas. Could that lawsuit be dismissed on the grounds that Doe is identically situated to Texas Right To Life, and it is already established that such a suit cannot lead to an award of damages?","answer":"As Texas Right to Life has not (as far as I know) yet sued any person or provider under SB8, I don't think there would be any legal justification for naming them in a suit.

{"question":"There was just a guy on the news who stuck his hand in a tiger enclosure. He was on the cleaning crew and was either feeding the tiger, or trying to pet it.

Since speeding is not a crime (setting aside certain extreme speeds which could be), it would not be included in general crime statistics. There are many law enforcement agencies who can issue speeding tickets (the state highway patrol; campus police; city police; the county sheriff), and at least in Washington, there is no law requiring a consolidation of that information at the state level. So you could construct a picture of the pattern in Washington by filing information requests of all of the relevant agencies, from which you could compute a daily average (assuming that's what you're interested in). You probably have to be specific about what offenses you're talking about (speeding, entering on red, failure to clear, illegal lane change, cell use, DUI etc.) -- some of those are crimes, and I would not assume that such counts are available especially for speeding in particular. If the local police have a running count of number of speeding tickets, then in a state with an information law that compels disclosure, they would have to tell you, but it might be in a 30 page report, and they can charge you 15 cents a page to copy the report, plus postage.

{"question":"This will be a terminology question, but first I have to explain some situations.In the U.S., each state has a written constitution that is higher than any act of the state legislature and is what grants the legislature its powers, and specifies how the state's government is organized. The constitution is drafted by statespersons within the state and voted on in a referendum within the state or within the area that is proposed to become a new state.In all but one instance, when Congress as admitted a new state to the Union, a new constitution of that state took effect at the time of admission and superseded whatever system of governance existed there before that, and a new governor and other new officers of the state (legislators, judges, etc.) began their terms.Before March 4, 1791, a polity then called the State of Vermont was neither one of the states of the Union nor a territory governed under and according to an act of Congress (as was done in many territories later), but was under a constitution drafted and put into effect within Vermont without any participation from outside Vermont, just as in states of the Union. In October 1790 Thomas Chittenden was sworn in to a one-year term as governor of the State of Vermont, succeeding Moses Robinson who had likewise been sworn in as governor of the State of Vermont one year earlier, and less than five months later when Vermont was admitted to the Union, he continued uninterrupted in the same one-year term as governor of the State of Vermont under the same constitution of the State of Vermont, as did all judges, sheriffs, members of the Governor's Council, etc.So now my terminology question: Should one say that this was the only state that did not undergo an internal constitutional discontinuity at the time of its admission, or would some other phrasing be more correct or otherwise better?","answer":"Law and language: You are asking the wrong questionI take your point, but I'd say you are asking the wrong question. The more interesting question is why Vermont did not need to change its constitution upon statehood. The answer is simple: Vermont had this constitution because, from its beginning, Vermont's citizens hoped for statehood. They made this clear in their very first constitution, written in 1777. After explaining at length why Vermont could not remain in either the British Empire or New York state, the  says Vermont should be:a free and independent State; and a...proper form of government, should exist in it, derived from, and founded on, the authority of the people only, agreeable to the direction of the honorable American Congress.Except for Vermont, Texas, California and West Virginia, the rest of the new states needed new constitutions because they had been territories of the US before statehood. As such, they did not have constitutions.Only Vermont and Texas were independent until statehood. Unlike Vermont, Texas had to change its constitution before statehood because its constitution explicitly provided for national powers. For example,  4 and 5 of Article II of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas gave its Congress the power to:To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and to regulate captures.To provide and maintain an army and navy, and to make all laws and regulations necessary for their Government.Obviously, these powers are inconsistent with statehood.How to talk about drastic change in governance institutionsI see what you mean about there being a discontinuity, but I'd be wary of mathy metaphors, such as discontinuities, bifurcations, catastrophes or singularities. I'd stick with words commonly used to describe drastic constitutional change. For example, Vermont was the only new state that did not have a constitutional revolution when it became a state.Having said that, I realize that constitutional historians and others love to talk about continuities, so why not use discontinuity?  My only caveat is that usually, they are talking more broadly than your wording (a discontinuity) suggests."}

That means neither can ever pass a law that names an individual and says 'they are suspended.'

If you attempt to enter in B visitor status with the intention of marrying and not leaving, but rather adjusting status, however, the immigration officer is entitled to refuse entry, and if you attempt to adjust status after entering in B visitor status, you may find yourself having to prove that you did not have the intention to do so when you entered.If Yes, What kind of marriage it would be ? A marriage between two non-immigrant or marriage between non-immigrant ( Visitor) and immigrant (Her)As noted in a comment, l don't think this matters.As she just got her work permit and SSN but not appeared for her asylum interview yet, Do I need to apply for any kind of k visa for marriage ? Or she needed to be green card holder first then I can apply for k visa.K visas are for the fianc\u00e9 or spouse of US citizens (and their children).

If you can't afford an immigration lawyer, you can get some generalized advice over at .If in my l-94 Form I am just allowed to stay for 2 weeks in the USA but i stay 90 days then marry her and come back to Canada. Then what will be its consequences for my Future green card application.If you overstay a 2-week period of admission and then leave the US you will trigger a few adverse provisions of immigration law.  If the US finds that you had intention to do this when you entered, for example, and lied about it, you could trigger permanent inadmissibility for misrepresentation.What would be the best possible solution for our case ?

{"question":"The Declaration of Independence says:We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are not part of the Bill of Rights, but they are recognized as unalienable rights. The Ninth Amendment of the Constitution says:The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.So we have many other rights besides those included in the Bill of Rights. Even in the Bill of Rights, we are told we have a natural right to bear arms and that it shall not be infringed, so it seems self-evident that growing and consuming plants would surely be a natural right. Is growing and consuming plants a natural human right in the United States?","answer":"US constitutional law does not refer to 'natural rights', it refers to 'fundamental rights'. This enters into the doctrine of  vs. lesser scrutinies. If the US Constitution specifically names it, it is a fundamental right: bearing arms, speaking and worshiping freely, protections against search and seizure and so on. The Supreme Court can also recognize a right as being fundamental, even if it is not directly protected in the Constitution; for example there is no explicit provision protecting the right to self defense, interstate travel, marriage, privacy and freedom of contract, but these are or have been treated as fundamental rights.Sometimes a fundamental right can be downgraded, such as the right to freedom of contract. In , 198 U.S. 45, the right to contract is taken to be a case of the right to liberty.  The general right to make a contract in relation to his business is  part of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, and this  includes the right to purchase and sell labor, except as controlled by  the State in the legitimate exercise of its police power. Liberty of  contract relating to labor includes both parties to it; the one has as  much right to purchase as the other to sell labor.But later, in  v. McGuire, 219 U. S. 549, the court backpedaled a bit and said that  it was recognized in the cases cited, as in many others, that freedom  of contract is a qualified, and not an absolute, right. There is no  absolute freedom to do as one wills or to contract as one chooses. The  guaranty of liberty does not withdraw from legislative supervision  that wide department of activity which consists of the making of  contracts, or deny to government the power to provide restrictive  safeguards. Liberty implies the absence of arbitrary restraint, not  immunity from reasonable regulations and prohibitions imposed in the  interests of the communityand , 300 U.S. 379 relied on this to essentially overturn Lochner (without expressly saying so). Parrish agred to work for less than state minimum wage, then sued for the difference. This court dismissed the supposed fundamental right to contract saying:  In each case the violation alleged by those attacking minimum wage  regulation for women is deprivation of freedom of contract. What is  this freedom? The Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract.  It speaks of liberty and prohibits the deprivation of liberty without  due process of law. In prohibiting that deprivation, the Constitution  does not recognize an absolute and uncontrollable liberty.Sometimes, a fundamental right is explicitly recognized and relied on in a court ruling, such as the right to privacy in , 141 U.S. 250, where the court said that  No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the  common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and  control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of  others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law. As well  said by Judge Cooley; 'The right to one's person may be said to be a  right of complete immunity: to be let alone.'Note that the ruling does not call it a 'fundamental right', but the notion of fundamentality is clearly there in the ruling. Other examples are the right to marry (, 388 U.S. 1):  The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital  personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free  men. Marriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamental  to our very existence and survival.Also, the right to chose to use contraceptives is a fundamental right (, 405 U.S. 438  note how this depends on and elaborates the right to privacy)  If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the  individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted  governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a  person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child. also relies on the right to privacy. The court notes that 'The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy', and then lays out how it is implicit in the Constitution.There is a vast area of actions that might reasonably be taken to be fundamental rights, but have not been ruled on one way or the other. If (in some bizarre dystopian future scenario) a law were passed that made it a crime to grow and use plants, it would not be surprising if SCOTUS ruled that such a law violates a fundamental right, but it almost certainly would be something much more general than 'growing plants'.. The court ruled that   The effect of the Act is to restrict the amount of wheat which may be  produced for market and the extent as well to which one may forestall  resort to the market by producing for his own needs.The Commerce Clause of the Constitution authorizes Congress to limit interstate commerce. Even though Filburn was not selling the wheat to another state, he also was not buying it from another state, and he was thus (minutely) affecting interstate commerce:  that the production of wheat for consumption on the farm may be trivial in  the particular case is not enough to remove the grower from the scope  of federal regulation where his contribution, taken with that of many  others similarly situated, is far from trivial.Another indication that there is no absolute fundamental right to grow plants is , 545 U.S. 1, which held (relying on Wickard) that 'Congress' Commerce Clause authority includes the power to prohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana in compliance with California law'."}
{"question":"The fourth section of the 25th amendment to the US constitution provides for the president to be declared unfit involuntarily.  The first of its two paragraphs describes the declaration itself, made by the vice president along with \"a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide.\"The second paragraph describes a mechanism for the president to resume the \"powers and duties\" of the office by declaring \"that no inability exists.\"  This paragraph also establishes a mechanism for \"the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide\" to challenge the president's declaration.This question is about the difference in the designation of those whose action is required along with the vice president.  The first paragraph uses the word \"departments,\" plural, and the second uses \"department,\" singular.I suppose that the second paragraph was added during the debates on the amendment, and that the use of the singular in the second paragraph is probably an error.Would courts be likely conclude that the difference is unintentional?  If not, does the use of the singular change the meaning of the phrase significantly?I am especially interested in answers that look at the the legislative history of the amendment to support or refute the hypothesis that the second paragraph was an addition to the original form of the text.  As far as I can tell, the relevant congressional documents are not available online for the 1960s.","answer":"Prologue, a magazine published by the National Archives, had an  back in 2012.In short, the problem was due to a scrivener's error. Congress recognized the error at roughly the same time it submitted the amendment to the states but decided it was too late to fix it:There was a brief discussion of the possibility of recalling the joint resolution for reconsideration in each chamber, but Congress was operating under severe time pressures as it worked toward adjournment for the summer, and it was decided that the record of congressional debates and actions on successive versions of the joint resolution made the intent so clear that the missing s could not affect interpretation of the text. The proposed amendment was therefore allowed to go to the states in its imperfect form.Given the basically undisputed nature of the error, I think it would be unlikely that courts would indulge an argument that department should be interpreted differently than departments, at least in any way that would change the outcome of a dispute under the 25th Amendment."}
{"question":"If an aircraft is in flight in the airspace above a US state, say Texas, does Texas state law, or potentially the laws of any other US states, apply to the passengers on board during that time, or is it solely US federal law that applies?Does the answer depend on whether the flight originated in Texas, landed in Texas, or on which other states' (if any) airspace the flight transitioned through while en route?Does the answer depend on the flight's duration, maximal altitude, or current altitude at the time the behavior in question was engaged in by a passenger?Does the answer depend on the type of aircraft (e.g., plane, helicopter, hot air balloon etc)?As a motivating example, consider a US state that bans medication abortion. If a pregnant woman in that state who seeks such an abortion boards an aircraft and the aircraft then takes off, the woman ingests the prohibited abortion medication, and the flight then lands a few minutes later, can the woman be prosecuted under the laws of the state?Edit: a comment suggested a similarity between my question and  involving international flights and which countries' jurisdictions apply to them. My question is about domestic US flights, in which case it seems reasonable to assume that only US law governs. The question is about which US law, that is, which of the different US jurisdictional layers (federal and state primarily) will apply in a given situation involving a US aircraft in flight. So, I don't think this question is a duplicate or answered by the other question.

{"question":"I am wondering if a House member is barred from entering the House side of the U.S. Capitol Building for him\/her choosing not wearing a face mask, while that House member is barred from the House side of the Capitol, does that House member's constituents lose their representation within Congress during that banishment period?If so, would this violate the constitutional rights of that House member's constituents to always be represented in Congress?","answer":"There is no current authorization to bar any member of the house from the floor, so the answer depends heavily on what actually happens. Since . SCOTUS, most importantly, asserted that this is a justiciable question, and most importantly In judging the qualifications of its members under Art. I, \u00a7 5, Congress is limited to the standing qualifications expressly prescribed by the Constitution. This could be overcome by expelling the member who refuses to wear a mask (Congress has the power to expel, but not exclude).There would be a significant conflict of rights in this case. Residents of the district has a right to representation (equal protection clause), but Congress has the right to expel members. But Congress has expelled 5 members, and most recently, Ohio's 17th district was without representation in the US House for a half a year after Traficant was expelled. That did not prevent the House from exercising its right to expel a member."}
{"question":"Something really confuses me about the whole legal aspect of confirming you sent someone mail.USPS has different types of mail (e.g. Certified Mail) for 'proving' you sent your mail (e.g. tax returns).(Note: This question is not specific to tax returns. I'm just using that as an illustrative example.)My question is, (how) does this prove anything about what you actually sent?  I could very well just stuff an envelope with empty pieces of paper (or, more plausibly, something totally irrelevant that is likely to be discarded) and mail it to some address, then get every kind of confirmation possible for it from the post office. And then claim that I sent some important piece of mail (say, my tax returns, or a contract, or some other legally important document).  And when court day comes, I'll have all the 'proof' I could possibly have from USPS for it, yet I clearly didn't need to actually do what I claimed.   So my question is, whether these mail certifications actually mean anything in a court?If they do, then why or how -- clearly I didn't need to send what I claimed?If not, then why do people need to use them for legal documents? What useful thing does it establish?","answer":"You appear to be conflating two different legal concepts: . something that furnishes proof: testimony; specifically:  something legally submitted to a tribunal to ascertain the truth of a matter the cogency of evidence that compels acceptance by the mind of a truth or a factSo evidence is presented to a tribunal who will then decide if that evidence meets the required .In a civil matter the burden of proof is met on the preponderance of evidence (in a criminal matter the burden is beyond reasonable doubt) and the onus of proof rests with the person making the allegation. Preponderance is based on the more convincing evidence and its probable truth or accuracy, and not on the amount of evidence. Thus, one clearly knowledgeable witness may provide a preponderance of evidence over a dozen witnesses with hazy testimony, or a signed agreement with definite terms may outweigh opinions or speculation about what the parties intended.Certified mail is evidence (very strong evidence) that something was mailed and delivered. It is, as you rightly point out not evidence of what it contained.So let's follow through with your IRS hypothetical:No Certified MailThe IRS alledges that you did not file your tax return - they have the burden of proof.As evidence, they put forward an affidavit that no return was filed.You put forward an affidavit that you did file a return.The judge considers the evidence and (probably) gives more veracity to the IRS's affidavit than yours - the IRS have met their burden of proof.Certified Mail 1The IRS alledges that you did not file your tax return - they have the burden of proof.As evidence, they put forward an affidavit that no return was filed.You put forward an affidavit that you did file a return and the proof of delivery from the USPS.The judge considers the evidence and (probably) considers that the IRS has recieved something from you: if it wasn't a tax return then they were in a position to give evidence as to what it was, and they didn't - given that it is the IRS that is obliged to prove that what they receieved wasn't a tax return, the IRS have not met their burden of proof.Certified Mail 2The IRS alledges that you did not file your tax return - they have the burden of proof.As evidence, they put forward an affidavit that no return was filed but they did recieve an envelope stuffed with newspaper clippings and here they are.You put forward an affidavit that you did file a return and the proof of delivery from the USPS and you have no idea how they changed from a tax return to newspaper clippings in transit.The judge considers the evidence and (probably) gives more veracity to the IRS's affidavit than yours - the IRS have met their burden of proof."}
{"question":"2 years ago in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a guy was driving 105 km\/h (max allowed 60) through red light and killed two teenage girls on crosswalk. He didn't even bother to stop. Instead, he called his sister and friend to get him to Serbia border where he fled to Serbia. Later he turned himself and was extradited to Bosnia where the trial began. Now the trial is over and he is accused of 'causing general danger' and 'not helping injured', but there is no mention of killing someone. The prosecutors want the maximum sentence for those two crimes which is, I believe, only 8 years. So, how would the crime be treated in the US? What would be the charges? What is the maximum sentence he could get?","answer":"In the United States, most Speeding in Excess is a misdemeanor as is Failing to Stop for pedestrians, who have the right of way in a crosswalk in all situations (even if they do not have the light).Leaving the Scene of an Accident is known as Hit and Run and can be anything from an infraction to a misdemeanor to a felony and the status would be based on the nature of the specific incident.  To my knowledge, most jurisdictions in the United States will elevated the charge to Felony Hit and Run for bodily injury and all will probably apply it for resulting death.The United States has a specific crime known as Vehicular Manslaughter, which covers death due to negligent operation of a motor vehicle or in violation of traffic safety laws.  This could also take the form of Constructive Manslaughter, which is unintended death resulting from commission of a misdemeanor offense, or Felony Murder (unintended death resulting in the commission of a Felony), though most states will have the Vehicular Manslaughter which requires a lower burden of culpability than traditional murder or manslaughter.Keep in mind, the prosecutor who receives the case has wide discretion in the charges and typically will reward criminals who make their job easier.  For cooperating by turning himself in, the prosecutor may not press the manslaughter charges and may push for Felony Hit and Run, which would carry a lighter sentence.  Additionally, 95% of U.S. Criminal Convicitions are done by cutting a deal with the Prosecutor's office for a Guilty Plea (which avoids the trial, which frees up court time for other cases) to lesser charges."}
{"question":"I live in a shared apartment in Virginia, USA with three other people. One of them is suspected in a criminal proceeding (that I am not involved with at all).

Likewise, when determining what to seize, the police can certainly choose to err on the broad side and seize anything that meets the criteria of the warrant without stopping to determine who owns what.."}
{"question":"I am a 38-year-old who has lived in the US since I was 2 years old.  I was born in China to Chinese National parents.  My parents and I immigrated to the US when was a small child.  My parents were naturalized before I became an adult, and thus I gained US citizenship automatically through derived citizenship (INA 320).  I've since obtained a US passport, and have traveled back to China using the US passport several times, applying for and receiving a Chinese visa.  I've always read that since China doesn't recognize dual citizenship, once I become a US citizen, I lose my Chinese citizenship.Recently, I was reading the actual wording of the Chinese Nationality Law, and realized that maybe under the actual wording of the law, I may technically still be a Chinese national under Chinese law.  Specifically, Article 9 says:Any Chinese national who has settled abroad and who has been naturalized as a foreign national or has acquired foreign nationality of his own free will shall automatically lose Chinese nationality.Since I acquired US citizenship automatically through derived citizenship when my parents naturalized, I myself did not technically go through the process of naturalization, nor was my acquisition of US citizenship done of my own free will.I also know that Article 3 of the Chinese Nationality Law says:The People's Republic of China does not recognize dual nationality for any Chinese national.I assume that just means that if I am in China, they will not recognize that I am also a US national, but does not actually mean I lose my Chinese nationality.I have heard that practically, China treats people who have entered on foreign passports as having given up the Chinese nationality, but in this case, the text of the law seems to imply that I haven't actually lost my Chinese nationality.Does that mean that maybe I get a Chinese passport?  I know mine from when I was a child expired a long time ago, but can I just go to the consulate and apply for a new one?I did some searching online, and I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned this as a path to holding both US and Chinese citizenship, as I'm sure Chinese national children gaining derived US citizenship from their parents after they move to the US as a minor is pretty common.  Does anyone have any real-world experience with how China treats automatic acquisition of US citizenship through INA 320 under the Chinese nationality law?","answer":"Does anyone have any real-world experience with how China treats automatic acquisition of US citizenship through INA 320 under the Chinese nationality law?While not exactly the same, there are many children who have both nationalities are that recognized as special cases by the Chinese government, i.e. conflict of nationality, often as a result of jus soli laws (e.g. the recently newsworthy Eileen Gu) (but jus sanguins can also apply if one of the parents is not Chinese and transmits another nationality).China is still developing its administrative legal system and things are more practicalities than legalities.Although recognized as Chinese national and having the same rights as children with only Chinese nationality in China (e.g. education, household registration), a child in this case does not benefit from a Chinese passport. The consulates or immigration authorities only issue a travel document to such persons, until they reach 18 years of age. Once they become adult, a passport would only be issued upon the presentation of the renunciation of the other nationality (unless no renunciation process is available).Now, if this person is living in China when they become adult and they do not want to travel abroad, they do not have to renounce the other citizenship to e.g. renew their national ID card, register for social insurance or seek employment.Even if you obtained another nationality voluntarily, resumption of Chinese nationality is also an option available that in practice is routinely granted (barring criminal histories etc.).The Chinese consulate would not issue you a passport, but may issue you a travel document if you present a renunciation of your U.S. citizenship. They may process it as if you never lost the Chinese nationality, or they may consider it a case of resumption."}

The person that first files papers with the court has to prove that there was a common law marriage.Recognizing that if there are children involved, or if one partner contests the divorce, things get messy and need to be sorted out legally.  However, what if there are no children, and the couple mutually decide to not follow through with formal wedding plans, and instead agree to simply part ways and pretend that nothing happened?There is no paper trail.  No proof that anything ever happened except perhaps jointly signed leases showing that at one point they lived together.  No reason for either to assert a claim over the other for reasons of alimony, custody, or asset disputes.  Neither has any interest or desire in attempting to prove to the state that they were married under common law.  Really their situation is no different from any other co-habitating and\/or engaged couple who later split up before completing an intended marriage ceremony.To title question then, would the state have any interest or legal right to assert that having once met conditions that would allow them to be considered married, that they are in fact still married despite their objections to that legal status and to being characterized as such?  Could both later legally claim to be single and never married?Bonus points for addressing how \"just kidding\" or \"I was lying\" could be used to counter the issue of \"holding out\".

To whit, the stated purpose and the bulk of the the text is an outline of the colonial grievances against King George III (most of these were actually grievances with Parliament, but George III had to give royal assent to legislation, so he approved the laws that had the Colonists so frustrated.).According to the Declaration's author, Thomas Jefferson, the document didn't contain anything new and a bulk of the grievances used were found in the Virginia Constitution and Virginia Declaration of Rights, both of which were influential documents in the creation of the U.S. Constitution and are usually documents that are used by Contextualist and Originalists in the court to support their arguments.The Declaration was ratified a year after the Revolutionary War started to justify the war.  Prior to this, the Patriots war goals were not well understood, and there were some engaged in the fight that would have liked to remain British, and just wanted the grievances to be addressed.  The Declaration held that, because of it's stated reasons, that ship had sailed.The line Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness is taken from Classical Liberal philosopy (though the Classical Liberal Philosophy of the day was more Life, Liberty and the pursuit of property.  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal... but he was also a hedonist and felt that the pursuit of happiness was a better goal... some people are happy with little to no material possessions after all!).As a rule, SCOTUS rarely cites the Declaration because the Declaration has no force of law, and was merely a statement from the Continental Congress laying out to foreign powers and their own people the justification for the Revolutionary War."}
{"question":"A Iowa-registered driver was on the highway in Indiana, US, going 26 mph over the speed limit. The driver was pulled over and was fined. The driver went and payed the fine in person and resolved the ticket.A few months later, when the driver went to the Ohio BMV to attempt to transfer his license to his new home state, he was informed (for the first time), that his license was suspended for the next 3 months.According to a phone call the driver had with the Iowa DOT, in Iowa, if a driver gets cited for going more than 20 mph over the speed limit, they must complete a defensive driving course within a number of days. If they dont, they risk a 6 month suspension of their license. I wasnt able to find this information in the .The Iowa DOT had sent a letter to the driver, which was returned to the sender. The Iowa DOT had a record of the letter being returned. They had not attempted to contact the driver further. Thus, the driver had no way of knowing of the requirements needed to keep his license valid.This seems like a problem in the Iowa DOT, and shouldnt have afflicted the driver with the consequences it did. Is there any way to challenge this decision? What steps could be taken?","answer":"It seems that the Iowa authorities did attempt to notify the driver. If the letter of notification was returned because the driver changed his or her address, that is not the DOT's fault -- drivers are supposed to notify the authorities of changes of address -- indeed driving with a license with an out-of-date address is itself a violation in some US states.If the error was made by the postal service, that is still not the DOT's fault but they might be more willing to accept an appeal from the driver.In general, authorities must make a reasonable attempt to notify people of court or administrative actions, but if those notifications fail, the authorities can go ahead in many cases. Try explaining that one doesn't owe taxes because an IRS notice was misdelivered. It would be too easy to avoid unwanted governmental actions if nondelivery of mail were a valid excuse.It may well be that there is a procedure to get the suspension waived or ended early, perhaps involving taking the class that should have been taken, and perhaps paying an additional fine. Details of such procedures vary. A local lawyer who deals with traffic issues frequently would probably know what steps might be taken.It may well be that the original ticket mentioned a possible suspension, but it may not have. That also varies by state."}
{"question":", bakers in certain US states can legally refuse service on the basis of sexual orientation. For the purposes of this question, assume that the state is Colorado. (all except New Jersey and Delaware) - in 48 states, minors under 18 can marry with parental consent, even in the absence of their own consent, and irrespective of the age of their spouse-to-be.As an example, I am not a baker, but I personally belong to a religion in which you generally need to be 21 to marry, and our leadership won't even consider it unless both partners are at least 18. Marriage before 21, and definitely before 18, is fundamentally against my deeply-held religious beliefs.Now let's suppose that I own a bakery. A couple comes in to my bakery to order a custom wedding cake, similar to the Masterpiece situation. One or both members of the couple are under the age of 18. Can I call on my religious freedom to refuse service to this couple?","answer":"In your hypothetical situation, I'm not aware of any law that prohibits denial of service merely because of age.

{"question":"There are Images uploaded to a certain website not linked to any accounts, just IP, linked in a case towards a federal case. can this evidence be inadmissible if the only proof is  'IP : Picture'. Prosecutor tagged all the pictures into evidence to the certain person.","answer":"This question needs more detail. As a cybersecurity professional I can provide some technical context around what I believe to be the situation.While I do not know the legal precedence, technically, IP addresses cannot typically be attributed to an individual person. There are a number of reasons for this.In a local network, IP addresses are not unique. Rather, they are distributed by the DHCP server, and are reassigned at intervals. Forensic attribution to an individual in most environments would require a DHCP log linking the IP to the machines MAC address, with time stamps that correlate to the individuals logon to that machine at the same time.If the IP correlation involves a VPN, it gets more difficult. I would need to know where the log\/evidence was obtained to determine what the IPs in question actually correlate to. If the evidence was obtained in local area network of the suspect, the IP addresses are likely assigned by the DHCP server (see previous). If they are obtained after encryption in transit to decryption, then very little can be determined. If they were obtained at the VPN server log, these IPs likely belong to an ISP which in turn may or may not be able to show what machine initiated the conversation.Digital photos often contain EXIF data, which is metadata about the photo. This data can contain details like, device make and model, sometimes location, time and date... If the defendant owns a Nikon such and such and the photo was taken with a Nikon such and such, and was uploaded using a VPN the defendant has an account with, and the defendant was in that location at the time and place of the photo... there may be enough there... but Im not a lawyer.I believe the discovery should include any EXIF metadata and logs to be used as evidence.You may need a special technical whiteness to educate the court on what can and cannot be determined (technically) given the evidence. Things to consider for such a witness could include:EXIF, forensic certification, network administration experience, VPN, TCPIP, OSI Model, Network Address Translation (NAT).Again, nothing here should be considered legal advise. Seek professional legal counsel."}
{"question":"Firstly, as a premise, what is the legal effect of expressly asking one not to contact them? Does it alter the nature of any future attempts to do so that are not of a legal-procedural nature? Off the cursory top of my head, I cannot think of any decisive way in which it would (such as a trespass warning in the United States would render future visits to a property a criminal offence) other than perhaps changing potential future police attitudes towards each party in future attendances of disputes, or perhaps in a less clear cut way it could render the future contact arguable harassment under the protection from harassment act.Onto the meat then, of the question\u2026 Alice is in an abusive relationship which she has left many times, always regretting previously again returning to it each time and wishing she wouldnt be so desperate as to have gone back yet once more.All of her friends admonish her that the abusive relationship is destroying her and reducing her to sheer ruin over the course of several years.She begins seeing a therapist who urges her to leave it permanently, but her abusive predator partner always comes back to entice her when she is most desperate.On one occasion she reports the situation to the police but just knows inside that like so many times before she may succumb again to her desperation.The two pieces of the solution are discouraging her predatory ex from making future attempts at contact and enticing her to return to him, and obviously, reinforcing her own willpower to resist any temptations that are put forth.If she is sufficiently strong willed then simply giving a clear and firm do not contact notice would solve the problem but if she can always be tempted to waive and negate it subsequently to issuing one, then it is useless. When Alice is with her friends, or taking stock of the situation in a more sober setting such as with her therapist or the police, she always vows never to go back, and it is only when she is lonely, isolated and desperate that she succumbs to her exs demonic temptations.If while she is with the police she wishes to issue a notice to her ex never to contact her again (ideally that would have some actual fangs in repercussions for violating it) that is not possible for her to later override under temptation, at least insofar as removing the disincentive\/repercussions for her ex to recontact her, what wording or device can she use to achieve this?","answer":"Generally, the relief sought in a case like this is a restraining order or a protective order. One might also pursue a criminal prosecution for stalking in the appropriate circumstances.Typically, if one can meet the high standard for issuance of such an order, a court issues a temporary order ex parte (i.e. based only upon what you have said and evidence you have provided) and then sets the matter for a hearing at which the person against whom the order is sought can defend themselves in court in a fairly short time period.If the judge finds that the high threshold to issue to order is met after considering the evidence at an adversarial evidentiary hearing, then the order becomes permanent or in force for a long period of time.The circumstances that can justify the issuance of such an order vary from state to state but usually must involve either a clear risk of serious physical harm or extreme harassment short of physical harm.Generally a court's restraining order or protective order cannot be waived by the protected person without another court order vacating it.Unlike most court orders, protection orders can usually be enforced directly by law enforcement rather than solely in an after the fact contempt of court proceeding in the court that issued the order originally. This said, even though the law may say that enforcing a protection order is mandatory, in practice, law enforcement discretion means that it is not. See Castle Rock v. Gonzales,  (2005).Also, as a matter of practical reality, law enforcement is often not able to stop someone who is violating a restraining order before it is too later, or because law enforcement is unable to confirm that a cyber stalker really is the person against whom a protection order has been issued.The U.S. Supreme Court is  regarding what kind of evidence that someone's communications amount to a true threat that is sufficient to justify legal consequences for this kind of contact.Simply continuing to contact you after you ask them to not contact you is rarely sufficient. But if someone who repeatedly contacts you in a way that you make clear is unwanted this is one factor among many used to consider if the conduct justifies issuance of an order or a criminal prosecution of some kind such as a stalking prosecution.Repeatedly contacting someone against their wishes can also get someone banned from an online platform outside the court process. Many online platforms have developed filters, blocking, and privacy controls in an attempt to make it harder to engage in this kind of conduct.The cycle of behavior of a victim in this case is a common one and it can make it very frustrating for lawyers, law enforcement, and other supportive people to help someone in this situation. I've certainly seen it play out first hand.In Colorado, the primary statutes are found at Colorado Revised Statutes, Sections . Colorado also imposes protection orders on a temporary basis during the divorce proceedings, many kinds of criminal cases, and certain other family law cases. Under the most common kind of case under these statutes, an order may be issued to:(I) To prevent assaults and threatened bodily harm;(II) To prevent domestic abuse;(III) To prevent emotional abuse of the elderly or of an at-riskadult;(IV) To prevent sexual assault or abuse; and(V) To prevent stalking.Some select definitions used include:Abuse of the elderly or of an at-risk adult means mistreatment of aperson who is sixty years of age or older or who is an at-risk adultas defined in section 26-3.1-101(1.5), including but not limited torepeated acts that: (a) Constitute verbal threats or assaults; (b)Constitute verbal harassment; (c) Result in the inappropriate use orthe threat of inappropriate use of medications; (d) Result in theinappropriate use of physical or chemical restraints; (e) Result inthe misuse of power or authority granted to a person through a powerof attorney or by a court in a guardianship or conservatorshipproceeding that results in unreasonable confinement or restriction ofliberty; or (f) Constitute threats or acts of violence against, or thetaking,  transferring, concealing, harming, or disposing of, an animalowned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by the elderly or at-riskadult,  which threats or acts are intended to coerce, control, punish,intimidate, or exact revenge upon the elderly or at-risk adult.Domestic abuse means any act, attempted act, or threatened act ofviolence, stalking, harassment, or coercion that is committed by anyperson against another person to whom the actor is currently or wasformerly related, or with whom the actor is living or has lived in thesame domicile, or with whom the actor is involved or has been involvedin an intimate relationship. A sexual relationship may be an indicatorof an intimate relationship but is never a necessary condition forfinding an intimate relationship. For purposes of this subsection (2),coercion includes compelling a person by force, threat of force, orintimidation to engage in conduct from which the person has the rightor privilege to abstain, or to abstain from conduct in which theperson has a right or privilege to engage. Domestic abuse may alsoinclude any act, attempted act, or threatened act of violence against:(a) The minor children of either of the parties; or (b) An animalowned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either of the parties or bya minor child of either of the parties, which threat, act, orattempted act is intended to coerce, control, punish, intimidate, orexact revenge upon either of the parties or a minor child of either ofthe parties.Sexual assault or abuse means any act, attempted act, or threatenedact of unlawful sexual behavior, as described in section16-11.7-102(3), C.R.S., by any person against another personregardless of the relationship between the actor and thepetitioner.Stalking means any act, attempted act, or threatened act of stalkingas described in section 18-3-602, C.R.S.The referenced section defines stalking as follows:A person commits stalking if directly, or indirectly through anotherperson, the person knowingly:(a) Makes a credible threat to another person and, in connection withthe threat, repeatedly follows, approaches, contacts, or places undersurveillance that person, a member of that person's immediate family,or someone with whom that person has or has had a continuingrelationship; or(b) Makes a credible threat to another person and, in connection withthe threat, repeatedly makes any form of communication with thatperson, a member of that person's immediate family, or someone withwhom that person has or has had a continuing relationship, regardlessof whether a conversation ensues; or(c) Repeatedly follows, approaches, contacts, places undersurveillance, or makes any form of communication with another person,a member of that person's immediate family, or someone with whom thatperson has or has had a continuing relationship in a manner that wouldcause a reasonable person to suffer serious emotional distress anddoes cause that person, a member of that person's immediate family, orsomeone with whom that person has or has had a continuing relationshipto suffer serious emotional distress. For purposes of this paragraph(c), a victim need not show that he or she received professionaltreatment or counseling to show that he or she suffered seriousemotional distress.(2) For the purposes of this part 6:(a) Conduct in connection with a credible threat means acts thatfurther, advance, promote, or have a continuity of purpose, and mayoccur before, during, or after the credible threat.(b) Credible threat means a threat, physical action, or repeatedconduct that would cause a reasonable person to be in fear for theperson's safety or the safety of his or her immediate family or ofsomeone with whom the person has or has had a continuing relationship.The threat need not be directly expressed if the totality of theconduct would cause a reasonable person such fear.(c) Immediate family includes the person's spouse and the person'sparent, grandparent, sibling, or child.(d) Repeated or repeatedly means on more than one occasion."}

{"question":"I would like to know if a U.S. citizen, especially for those living in California, can face criminal charges from local or state authorities if they contact ICE instead of the local police to report the whereabouts of an illegal immigrant(s).For example, say that someone is at a gas station late at night pumping gas and a truck pulls in to a gas pump next to their car.

{"question":"Intent without Damages: Suppose a store has a \"Henry Deal,\" where anyone named Henry gets a 10% discount. I claim to be named Henry to get the deal, and nobody checks my ID. This would probably be fraud, unless the store is expected to actually check for an ID, which is possible. But suppose there was a \"Joseph Deal,\" which means that anyone named Joseph gets a 10% discount. While my intention was to lie to get a discount, I did not realize that I could get the discount without lying. Is this fraud? (I realize this is an unrealistic scenario, but this is an example.) In other words, if a person lies to get a financial advantage that could have been gotten without lying, is it fraud?Lying without Intent: Suppose I lie and get something which I could not have gotten without lying, but which I assumed I could have gotten without lying. For example, suppose a store has a deal, but I do not notice that it says \"For Residents Only.\" When I go to the counter to pay, I say that I am a resident and do not realize that I got a deal which I did not deserve. Is this fraud or does it depend on how obviously the restriction is written and whether I should have noticed it?","answer":"At common law, fraud is generally understood to have the following elements:a representation or, where there is a duty to disclose, concealment of a fact,which is material to the transaction at hand,made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity, or with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it is true or false that knowledge may be inferred,with the intent of misleading another into relying upon it,justifiable reliance upon the representation or concealment, anda resulting injury proximately caused by the reliance..Because the transaction must satisfy every one of these elements, neither of your hypotheticals would constitute fraud. In the first, there is no resulting injury, as the store's loss of revenue would have occurred even if you had made a truthful representation. In the second, your misrepresentation was not made with the intent to induce any reliance (i.e., a discount) on it.The store might also argue that the second case would constitute a negligent misrepresentation, but I think that would fail also.

So, getting to court first in a favorable forum court jurisdiction can be a key litigation tactic when choice of law issues are potentially implicated.Generally, truly procedural issues are always a question governed by the law of the forum state.But for substantive law issues, the modern rule in most U.S. states is that the law governing a legal issue presented in a case is governed by the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the issue, in a multi-factor wholistic analysis that considers the connection of each of the parties to the state and the connection of the underlying facts giving rise to the dispute to the case. The most significant relationship analysis is a highly fact specific inquiry for which all manner of connections between the proposed state's law, and the parties, and the legal issues are considered.Choice of law rules are generally considered to be procedural issues, at least, unless a contractual choice of law provision states otherwise.It is not always obvious, however, what constitutes a procedural rule and what constitutes a substantive rule. Federal courts in diversity jurisdiction cases make this distinction under what is called the Erie Rule and there is considerable detail exploring which rules are procedural and which are substantive. State courts in a case where another jurisdiction's substantive law might apply engage in a similar analysis.Notwithstanding this general rule, there are statutory and case law exceptions, and a judge in the forum state will not apply a rule of law that is squarely contradicted by a public policy of the forum state.Sometimes the laws of multiple states are applied to different legal issues in the same case, a concept called .The modern multi-factor balancing most significant relationship doctrine started to enter wide use in roughly the 1960s and replaced a traditional set of choice of law rules in which bright line rules determined which jurisdiction's laws applied to different kinds of cases, in the absence of an affirmative mutual choice of law by the parties (for example, in a contractual choice of law clause).Some of those bright line rules still have considerable force. Real property law issues are almost always decided based upon the law of the place where the real property is located. The internal governance issues of a legal entity formed under the laws of a state are predominantly governed by the laws of the state of formation. Disputes concerning trustees and beneficiaries and settlors of trusts are mostly governed by the law of the place where the trust is primarily administered. Most probate issues (except those applying to out of forum state real property) are governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the decedent is domiciled at death. Traffic law and criminal law is predominantly governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the alleged violation of those laws took place.In tort and contract law, choice of law analysis has been more strongly governed by the modern most significant connection rule.Historically, tort cases were governed by the law of the place where the tort was committed.In contract law, the traditional rules were to look to the law either of the place where the contract was formed (typically, the place where the person accepting an offer to make a contract was located when the contract was executed), or the place where the contract was to be performed.The aggregate effect of the modern rule relative to the traditional rules for choice of law is that courts end up applying the forum state's law more often than they did under the traditional rules.But this is also partially due to the fact that in the post-WWII era, when the modern choice of law rules were adopted, a series of court decisions made it much easier to bring a lawsuit against someone in the place where the events giving rise to the lawsuit arose, rather than the place where the defendant was domiciled (as a concept called long arm jurisdiction was widely adopted and given U.S. Supreme Court approval). So, some of the shift to a selection of forum state law reflected the fact that the forum state was more often the state with the most significant relationship to the case than was historically the case.There are also some areas of law that are governed by very specific statutory choice of law rules, most notably, choice of law questions arising under the Uniform Commercial Code, and choice of law questions related to child custody (in which there are parallel federal and state laws plus an international treaty or two, the state laws are almost completely uniform, and the laws were designed to complement each other).I've seen some contracts say something along the lines of in case ofa dispute this contract should be interpreted by [states] rules. Isthat legally binding if the other state wouldn't usually respect thecontract?This is usually binding, unless applying the law of the state other than the forum state selected would violate a strong public policy of the forum state which could not be contractually waived in the forum state.Could I do that even if neither signer lived in a state if I wanted totake advantage of that states legal precedent?Usually only if the contract or the parties have some meaningful connection to the state whose law is chosen, although arbitrators will often respect a choice of forum even if the parties have no connection to the place whose law is chosen to apply.It is also not uncommon in business to business commercial transactions (such as letter of credit transactions), especially international ones, for the parties to elect that their contract be governed by a set of highly specific contractual provisions that substitute for legal precedent on most key issues between the parties by incorporating by reference a commercial standard form of boilerplate terms.Lets say person A and person B sign a contract, in which person Asigns away their right to a financial claim. The two people live indifferent states, and one state has a precedent for respecting thistype of contract and the other state doesn't allow signing away legalrights in that manner then what happens if person A tries to claimtheir financial claim they signed away?A typical modern choice of law analysis would begin by asking if the state where the person signing away legal rights was protected by the law of their own state (strengthening the argument that it should not be enforced), or by the laws of the other party's state. It would ask what the source of the public policy invalidating this kind of waiver was, and how strong that public policy was. It would ask where the events giving rise to the financial claim arose, where the contract was agreed to by each party, who wrote the contract, and where other parts of the contract were to be performed. It would also consider where someone chose to sue.Schrodinger ContractFrom the perspective of parties evaluating their rights under a contract that is not yet in litigation, the choice of law question is uncertain (because there are significant ambiguities in how the modern rule applies to particular facts, and sometimes even in how the traditional rules apply to particular facts), and is indeterminate, and unknowable in many cases (in part because the forum in which the question will be decided is not known in advance).Different states have different choice of law rules. Some states cling to the traditional rules in particular areas of law. Some states use the modern rule in particular areas of law. All states have precedents regarding how their choice of law rules are interpreted, but in many states there are lots of questions of first impression not governed by any precedents that are closely on point.Sometimes, you can do an analysis of the choice of law issues in every possible forum and conclude that they would reach the same conclusion on the merits in every possible forum. But, if this is not the case, the parties won't know what substantive law governs their contract until an actual dispute arises and somebody brings a lawsuit.This is why it is better practice to draft such contracts with a clearly stated choice of law and to confirm that there isn't a law in one of the states that could be a forum for resolving the dispute that would invalidating the contract as a matter of public policy."}
{"question":"The Sixth Amendment refers to:\"an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law\"Presumably this originally applied to federal offenses and the \"districts\" were federal judicial districts.

Would that mean \"districts\" could mean districts within which the courts of a state have jurisdiction?","answer":"The key phrase here is:... which district shall have been previously ascertained by lawThat means the relevant district must be specified by law. In the case of a state criminal case, by state law. In some states it would be a county, when the relevant court is a county court. In any case, it would be whatever district the relevant court of criminal jurisdiction had as its area of jurisdiction."}

{"question":"From .Afroman is reportedly being sued by a number of Ohio sheriff deputies for allegedly profiting off the raid they conducted on his home last summer.The Adams County Sheriffs Department ran up on Afromans home last August, where officers searched for illegal narcotics but failed to find anything.Afroman filmed the entire raid via his security cameras, and in the months since the raid has compiled the footage together to turn it into a music video called Will You Help Me Repair My Door. This has reportedly upset the Ohio sheriffs deputies involved in the raid as they believe Afroman to be profiting off their hard work.In turn, the police are suing for invasion of privacy and misappropriation of their likenesses, and are claiming the music video has caused them emotional distress, ridicule, humiliation, loss of reputation and embarrassment.My house is my property, my video camera films, everything on my property as they begin, stealing my money, disconnecting plus destroying my video camera system, they became my property, Afroman said. Criminals caught in the act, of vandalizing and stealing money. My video footage is my property. I used it to identify the criminals who broke into my house, and stole my money. I used it to identify criminals, who broke into my house, stole my money and disconnected my home security system.Do the Ohio sheriffs suing Afroman have any legal standing in their claim \"invasion of privacy and misappropriation of their likenesses\" lawsuit?","answer":"Yes, individuals do have personal standing in suits for invasion of privacy and the like.Ohio generally follows the federal approach to standing law, which requires that a litigant alleges a (1) concrete (2) personal injury (3) caused by the defendant (4) which can be redressed by the court. See generally: Kristen Elia, Ohio's Standing Requirements and the Unworkable Public-Rights Exception,  (2018)A person clearly has standing to bring a tort suit on one's own behalf, alleging personal harms flowing from the defendant, requesting money damages. Suits such as this are perhaps the oldest and most well-established examples of standing.I defer to  about the likelihood of success on the merits raising potential standing issues in the case that the claims are founded on injuries that are just not legally possible (I find the line between standing and merits difficult to draw in cases like this)"}
{"question":"I called my town's county clerk office (in Florida, USA) to inquire about how to transfer the deed of my parent's house to being solely in my mom's name following my dad's passing (she is disabled and unable to carry out these things herself.)The person I spoke to told me to download a 'generic deed form' off the internet, fill it out, and send $10 for the first page of the document plus $8.50 for each additional page, plus $10 for the death certificate as well as the death certificate itself.I am unable to find such a generic document. Did I misunderstand? This whole thing seems pretty fishy! Is it even necessary?","answer":"It depends upon how the property was titled at your dad's death.If the property was titled as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the title transfers to your mom by operation of law, and you would ordinarily record a certified copy of the death certificate along with an affidavit establishing that the person named in the death certificate and the person whose name appears on the deed are one and the same person, in the real property records. This makes it clear on the face of the public record that the transfer by operation of law upon his death has occurred. It would be better practice to pay the quite low price an attorney would charge to make sure that this is done right.If the property was titled as a tenancy in common (which is true unless the words 'with right of survivorship' or 'JTWROS' appear on the face of the deed placing them in title together), then the ownership of your dad's undivided percentage ownership interest in the house must be done via the probate process which is governed by his will, if he had one, and by the laws of intestate succession, if he did not have a will. The person named in a will, if there is one, would have priority to be named as executor, and would seek that appointment in a petition filed with the appropriate court in Florida with probate jurisdiction. If there is no will, your mom is probably the person with priority to be appointed, but can waive that in favor of her children (any sibling with have to waive priority or be jointly appointed). Once the executor is appointed by a court and issued a document called 'letters', they execute an executor's deed (which is a special form) from the decedent to the person entitled to inherit it. Either way, you should have an attorney handle the probate court filing.It is highly desirable to clear up the record title in one way or the other, as this must be done before any sale to a third party and before any new mortgage is obtained, it will simplify inheritance at your mother's death if she still owns it at that point, and it will prevent property tax bills from being issued to your deceased father potentially creating a complicated probate case. You should also have the house appraised as of the date of his death as this value is relevant if the house is sold prior to her death for capital gains tax purposes."}
{"question":"Let's sayThe plaintiff lives in Florida, US.The defendant lives in California, US.The plaintiff sues the defendant in a Texas District Court due to diversity jurisdiction. The case involves serious fraud and the plaintiff has no contractual relationship with the defendant.Since California law has no cap for punitive damages, can the judge in Texas apply California law with regards to punitive damages?If it is possible, could you cite some cases?","answer":"Short AnswerAt the level of generality presented in the question, it is impossible to know with any meaningful level of comfort, which state's laws regarding punitive damages caps will apply, even if there are prior precedents addressing a similar issue, since the determination is so dependent upon a rich set of relevant facts.Long AnswerDoes Federal Or State Law Apply?In a diversity case, under what is known as the , after the U.S. Supreme Court case that established it, a federal district court sitting in diversity applies the substantive law of the state in which it is located (including its choice of law rules) and federal procedural law.A variety of subsequent cases have clarified (or at least made more specific) what counts as substantive law, and what counts as procedural law. A .To cut a long analysis short, punitive damage limitations generally count as substantive law under this test.So, the question of which state's law to apply to punitive damages caps in a diversity case brought in a U.S. District Court in Texas is precisely the same as the question faces by a Texas state court regarding which state's law to apply.Choice Of Law Analysis At The State LevelIn general, a state court (or a federal court sitting in diversity) applies the law of the state in which it is located unless a party argues that under choice of law principles that another state's law should apply, and that party shows that the law of the state whose law is proposed is different from the law of the state where the case is being tried.Historically, there were rigid rules that provided that in particular kinds of cases, a particular state's law would apply. Some of those historical rules continue to have full force.For example, the substantive real property law of the state where real property is located almost always applies.But, in other cases, a more vague modern rule for choice of law applies. This is the rule that the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the issue to be decided should apply. Different issues in the same case may end up being governed by different laws as a result.Among the factors to be considered in applying a most significant relationship test are:The place where the event giving rise to the claim occurred.The interest of the state where the person who was harmed resides in controlling the amount of compensation that the person harmed received.The interest of the state where the person who caused the harm resides in encouraging or discouraging business activity that may hurt others.The interest of the state where the insurance company paying some or all of the claim is located in not driving up insurance premiums.The inquiry in this multi-factor balancing test is usually extremely fact intensive.The practical effect of the most significant relationship test has been to make the ultimate decision less predictable and to make it more likely that a judge will decide that the forum state's law will apply. Under the historical rule, about two-thirds of requests to apply a non-forum state's law were granted. Under the modern rule, about one-third of such requests are granted.A A short article looking at the case law for choice of law cases with regard to punitive damages can be found . It opens by observing that:The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly acknowledged that whilestates are afforded discretion over the imposition of punitivedamages, state law is still subject to procedural and substantiveconstitutional limitations on these awards. State Farm Mut. Auto.Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 416 (2003). Relying on the DueProcess Clause, the Court has provided some basis for determiningwhich state's law applies to the punitive damages question and whatconduct is subject to punitive liability. In Phillips Petroleum Co. v.Shutts, for example, the Supreme Court held that for a State'ssubstantive law to be selected in a constitutionally permissiblemanner, that State must have a significant contact or significantaggregation of contacts, creating state interests, such that choice ofits law is neither arbitrary nor fundamentally unfair. PhillipsPetroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 818 (1985) (internal quotationmarks and citation omitted). The Court has also made clear that[e]lementary notions of fairness require that a defendant must begiven fair notice of what conduct is subject to punitive damages, aswell as the severity of the penalty that may be imposed. BMW of N.Am. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 574 (1996).It also observes in an analysis that should be taken with a grain of salt, because it comes from a law firm that defends companies that are usually defendants in product liability cases rather than plaintiffs and is not written by a neutral party:a growing number of courts have begun to recognize that an analysis ofthe Restatement factors points to the application of defendants' homejurisdictions' laws to the issue of punitive damages. See, e.g.,Kirchman v. Novartis Pharm. Corp., No. 8:06- cv-1787-T-24-TBM, 2014 WL2722483, at *4 (M.D. Fla. June 16, 2014) (applying the law of NewJersey to punitive damages claim because that state is the place ofinjury-causing conduct, i.e., the state where Novartis made itscorporate decisions regarding the labeling, packaging and warning ofthe drugs, which Plaintiff alleges caused Mr. Kirchman's osteonecrosisof the jaw) (citation omitted); Williams v. Novartis Pharm. Corp., 15F. Supp. 3d 761, 768 (S.D. Ohio 2014) (When a plaintiff seekspunitive damages against a manufacturer in a products liability casebased on a 'failure to warn' theory, the focus, for purposes of achoice-of-law analysis, needs to be on the place where the defendant'salleged corporate misconduct occurred.); Braun, 2014 WL 345246, at *5(California law applied to punitive damages claims against infantsling manufacturer because defendant designed its products inCalifornia and therefore all of the actions that would form thebasis for punitive damages occurred there); Dopson-Troutt v. NovartisPharm. Corp., No. 8:06-CV-1708-T-24-EAJ, 2013 WL 3808205, at *4 (M.D.Fla. July 22, 2013) (The Court agrees with the reasoning of the othercourts who have found that the Restatement principles supportapplying New Jersey law to the punitive damages issue in this casebecause the basic policy underlying punitive damages is to punish anddeter [the defendant], whose conduct occurred in New Jersey . . . .)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). For example, in Irby,a Virginia plaintiff alleged that he developed osteonecrosis of thejaw after ingesting the drug Zometa, manufactured by Novartis. Irby,2011 WL 5835414, at 2. The parties stipulated that Virginia lawgoverned the plaintiff's compensatory claims for failure to warn,defective design, breach of implied warranty, negligence, and consumerfraud. They disagreed, however, on which state's law should governplaintiff's punitive damages claim. Virginia law caps punitive damagesat $350,000, while New Jersey law bars them completely in casesinvolving FDA-approved drugs. Plaintiff argued Virginia law shouldapply as the place of injury, while Novartis argued that the law ofNew Jersey should apply because its principal place of business islocated in that state.To some extent, these choice of law principles apply even in cases where there are arguably procedural rules that apply, rather than merely blindly following a federal procedure and state substantive distinction. Wikipedia's entry on the Erie doctrine :Erie has gone in a newer andeven more complicated direction than the previous controlling cases,and that instead of selecting either federal or state law for a case,the federal court may be required to somehow blend federal and statelaw, depending on the issue. This is quite frustrating for those whowish to have a black-letter rule that will point them to the answer.However, the possibility of blending in Erie does not open up aninfinitude of possibilities.But even in the context here where it is clear that state law rather than federal law applies, the determination of which state's law applies is itself involved and is frustratingly indeterminate."}

{"question":"I am confused by  story. Someone fired a bullet, but it was stopped by a cop's belt. The shooter was not charged with attempted murder. Why might that be?","answer":"It's important to keep in mind that charges don't really tell us much about what crimes actually occurred. Sometimes cops file charges that aren't justified; sometimes they don't file charges that would be justified. There can be lots of reasons for the gaps between the evidence and the charges. My best guess is that the officers involved don't have quite as much information about his intent as they'd like to have when they go in front of a judge to argue for keeping this guy locked up.If they're going to hold him for attempted murder, they'll need to present evidence about what he was thinking and demonstrate that he intended to cause the officer's death ()They'll probably bring him up on murder charges, but they probably don't lose much by just booking him now on something easy to prove but serious enough to justify holding him, and then letting a grand jury indict him on the most serious charges."}

(b) No domestic or foreign limited liability company may be formed or authorized to do business in this state under this chapter unless its articles of organization or application for authority designates the secretary of state as such agent.What I haven't been able to figure out is what this accomplishes, assuming the LLC itself is in New York - why can't I accept service at my business address, or my lawyer's address, etc?I find the situation rather confusing in light of the fact that in New York, personal service is required for some family law issues.","answer":"In a state, the secretary of 'state' (interior, actually), is a registrar with which all corporations in the state must register. As a result, the secretary of state is the person\/entity that has access to all corporations, and with whom all corporations must interact in order to derive their status as corporations in that state.

New circuit splits arise somewhere on some issue many times each year.It is difficult to quantify this because there are lots of subtle differences of wording or application of the law between circuits that ordinarily are not considered circuit conflicts but could lead to a different result under some highly unusual set of facts. Establishing the existence of a circuit conflict, and becoming familiar with the conflicts that are most promising to see resolved, is one of the particular skills of lawyers who practice before the U.S. Supreme Court.It is also worth noting that state courts can also enunciate questions of federal law that are presented to them without regard to the rule adopted by the federal circuit in which they are located (federal courts in U.S. territories and possessions are bound by the precedents of their federal circuit on questions of federal law). So, there are 50 states and each of the 13 federal circuits (1-11, DC and Federal) which are directly subordinate to the U.S. Supreme Court and could take a position on a question of federal law that could conflict with another jurisdiction leading to a split of authority that can only be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.What happens when a circuit split is not resolved?When a circuit split is not resolved courts in each circuit follow the precedents set by their particular circuit. Meanwhile, trial courts and appellate courts in circuits that have not taken a position in the circuit split give particularly careful and reasoned consideration to which side the court should take in an undecided circuit as a matter of first impression.Unresolved circuit splits are not uncommon and can last for decades on issues that the U.S. Supreme Court deems unimportant."}

Would the victim be obligated to mark viruses as such, even if there is no intention of distributing them in any way?If possible, please point out if there are differences in the law in areas, i.e. if something applies only in USA, or only in Europe, Australia, Russia etc.Thanks.","answer":"In common law jurisdictions like the United States, this would probably be controlled under normal tort principles, which would mean that the answer turns on the hacking victim's state of mind.If the victim is unaware of the virus or unaware of the hacker, she probably has no duty to the hacker, and therefore cannot be held liable for any injury he suffers as a result of her failure to address the virus.But if this a case of a victim laying a trap for a potential hacker, then you have a variation on the old spring gun cases. The classic example is .In that case, a man owned an house -- abandoned for about a decade -- that kept attracting burglars and vandals, even after he boarded it up and posted no trespassing signs. So Briney rigged up a shotgun to fire at anyone who entered the bedroom. About a month later, two antique collectors went into the house looking for old bottles and jars. One of them, Katko, opened the door to the bedroom, and the gun basically blew off one of his legs.Although he was convicted of breaking into the house, Katko sued Briney for negligence. The jury awarded Katko $20,000 for medical expenses and the like, as well as $10,000 in punitive damages. Consistent with the approach of most courts, the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed the verdict:The value of human life and limb, not only to the individual concerned but also to society, so outweighs the interest of a possessor of land in excluding from it those whom he is not willing to admit thereto that a possessor of land has ... no privilege to use force intended or likely to cause death or serious harm against another whom the possessor sees about to enter his premises or meddle with his chattel, unless the intrusion threatens death or serious bodily harm to the occupiers or users of the premises.So I'd argue that a person who leaves a virus lying around his computer, hoping to infect a hacker, is like Briney, intentionally laying a trap to injure someone who he could probably just defend himself against instead, and therefore liable to the hacker for injuries.But I could also argue it the other way: Briney's trap was designed to inflict bodily harm or even death against a person who posed no real threat, given that the property was abandoned, while a computer virus merely disables the hacker's weapon, and is used against someone who is attacking property that has greater value than an abandoned house, given the quantity and often extremely sensitive nature of contents on a personal computer.So the answer, as always, is that it could go either way."}

They know they don't have those cars and cant get them because they don't exist and never will be built again.  You order a car and they take your money knowing the sale cannot happen.Isn't this fraud? If so, at what jurisdictional level would stealing money this way online relate to? State, interstate or federal government laws?","answer":"In general, knowingly making a false statement as part of a commercial or financial transaction, or as part of a contract, with the intention that the other party will rely on that statement and be harmed by this is likely to be fraud.However, there are some limitations. For the lie to be common-law fraud:The other party must in fact rely on the false statement.The other party must suffer harm as a result of relying on the false statement.The reliance must be reasonable.If a seller advertises having new 1957 model cars in 2020, a court might well find that this was so improbable that no reasonable person would have relied on hte statement, and that therefore it is not fraud. Whether the reliance is reasonable depends on the overall facts of the case, and the details might affect what is considered reasonable.In some jurisdictions such a false statement might be actionable false advertising even if  it is not fraud.If the US mails are used as part of a fraud or attempted fraud  applies. This law applies whether any actual harm occured or not, adn whether the victim relied on the false statement or not. It is commonly known as mail fraud. is a US Federal law that prohibits a variety of false statements and false documents. prohibits false statements and documents in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States but I am not clear if this would apply in the case described in the question.Other sections of chapter 47 deal mostly with false statements made to the US Government, or to obtain money or benefits from the government, Or in connection  with various particular regulated activities, and do not seem to apply to the case in the question.According to :Federal fraud statutes, along with most state laws, require proof of a scheme or artifice to defraud. The statutes do not provide an explicit definition of these terms, but courts have developed definitions through precedent. The U.S. Supreme Court held in Carpenter v. United States that the terms apply to any plan intended to deprive another of property, regardless of whether it would cause immediate financial harm.However, I think that a scheme such as the one described in the question would be more likely to be prosecuted by a US State than by the US Federal government. Either the state where the maker of the false statements was at the time of the statements, or the state where the victim was present could prosecute."}

There is no requirement that they see the will itself, and they do not attest anything regarding sound mind, memory or testamentary capacity. It is not required that witnesses receive a copy of the will (for any reason), and it is probably extremely rare for them to do so.However, a witness could be called, during a subsequent court procedure, to testify as to relevant facts such as that a beneficiary held a gun to the testator's head."}

{"question":"In short, Dutch police ordered Binance (cryptocurrency exchange) to freeze funds of some Colombian customers, and those customers are supposed to prove - to the satisfaction of Dutch police - that their funds were legally obtained. This is related to a money laundering investigation by the Dutch.  (The translation quality is good, there are just minor errors, like referring to the female lawyer as \"he\".)At first sight, this looks like a blatant overreach by the Dutch police. What if there is difference in how money laundering is defined in Colombia and in Netherlands, or a difference in what constitutes legally obtained funds? Are Colombian citizens supposed to know and obey Dutch law?I could understand this if Binance were a Dutch company, and\/or if they included in their ToS a clause like \"all disputes between the Conpany and the Customer will be decided according to the Dutch law by Dutch courts\". But this is not the case - ToS mention law of Hong Kong ( , section X.2)So the main question is: on what basis could the Dutch claim their jurisdiction? Or could it be that the Dutch did not request the freeze in a legally binding way, they just advised Binance to comply? But according to the article, Binance had to freeze the funds.","answer":"Countries have jurisdiction in criminal matters primarily because either (1) the crime affects people in their country, or (2) the crime is carried out in their country.The Netherlands is well within established norms of criminal jurisdiction to enforce money laundering laws that impact commerce in or with the Netherlands, which appears to be what happened in this case.Also, the locus of where a crime that takes place on the Internet occurs is also somewhat nebulous. If Dutch residents are parties to those transactions, and the transactions constitute money laundering under Dutch law, there is a fair argument that the money laundering transactions take place in the Netherlands for legal purposes.The main issue, as a practical matter, is what the Netherlands can do in order to force Binance to comply with its orders if Binance fails to do so.The political and legal reality is that as long as the Dutch courts have the practical ability to enforce their orders, the Netherlands has jurisdiction to enforce those orders from a legal perspective if the Dutch courts agree that they have the power to do so.I lack the technical level understanding of the operations of Binance to know precisely what the Dutch government could do in this case, however. Someone with a deeper technical understanding will have to address that issue. It could simply be that the Dutch government is confident that it could successfully extradite Binance officials who willfully disobeyed its orders from whatever countries they reside in.Usually extradition is available, if there is an extradition treaty in force, if both countries have laws criminalizing the same basic type of conduct with similar degrees of seriousness. So, if the country where the Binance officials are located has a money laundering law that is in broad outline similar to that of the Dutch money laundering law, and if the two countries have an extradition treaty, the Dutch threat to have the offenders outside the Netherlands arrested and extradited to the Netherlands is a credible one.:Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange which is the largest exchange in the world in terms of daily trading volume of cryptocurrencies. Itwas founded in 2017 and is registered in the Cayman Islands.Binance was founded by Changpeng Zhao, a developer who had previouslycreated high frequency trading software. Binance was initially basedin China, but later moved its headquarters out of China following theChinese government's increasing regulation of cryptocurrency.In 2021, Binance was put under investigation by both the United StatesDepartment of Justice and Internal Revenue Service on allegations ofmoney laundering and tax offenses. The UK's Financial ConductAuthority ordered Binance to stop all regulated activity in the UnitedKingdom in June 2021.Japan, Thailand, and Malta (another E.U. member) are also involved in enforcement efforts against Binance.Under the circumstances, it looks like the Netherlands would probably have the U.S., the U.K., E.U., Japanese, and Thai money laundering officials on its side, so it could expect considerable cooperation in its international efforts to enforce it orders.While officially organized in the Cayman Islands (a notorious tax and asset protection haven), it appears that the brain trust of the organization is based in China, which might not be so cooperative. But, multinational business executives can be greatly hampered if warrants for their arrest are outstanding in much of the world.Also, China, while it is prone to ignore business corruption for extended periods of time, every now and then embarks on harsh, mass, anti-corruption campaigns in which large numbers of allegedly corrupt business people are executed or imprisoned with little or no formal due process in short order and with little warning. So, Chinese based executives of the company know that if they become too much of a problem to the Chinese government and the Communist Party of China, that they can be thrown under the bus in a manner much more literal than the way that this term is usually used. ."}
{"question":"It's an election year!  That means in November, millions of people are going to stand in a really long line.  If they get out of this line to use the bathroom or get refreshments, they could lose their spot, especially after the polls officially close.This reluctance to get off the line got me thinking; is it legal, in the United States, to sell snacks to fellow voters in line?  If I were to pull out a crate of fun-sized bags of potato chips and mark them up 500% after the doors close, I could make a killing.  Of course, I wouldn't actually do this, as it's predatory and unethical.  Could I, though?

{"question":"I was a Sri Lankan citizen who acquired US citizenship via naturalization about a year ago. This automatically voided my Sri Lankan citizenship. However, I got to know that I can apply to resume my Sri Lankan citizenship which would give me dual citizenship.However  page on the department of State website says \"obtaining naturalization in a foreign state after the age of 18 (Sec. 349 (a) (1) INA)\". as a \"Potentially Expatriating Act\". It also says \" if they perform certain specified acts voluntarily and with the intention to relinquish U.S. nationality\"I am definitely not doing this with an intention to relinquish my U.S. nationality, but I am not sure what exactly constitutes 'intention'.While I understand this is not an actual legal forum, I just want to get a pulse on what people's experience has been in similar situations. I definitely plan to reach out to a lawyer to confirm before I proceed, but thought this might be a good thing to discuss in a public forum for the sake of general knowledge also.","answer":"Intention to relinquish means you actually meant to stop being a US citizen.  In practice, the US assumes that normal people doing normal things don't want that. As described on the page you linked, there's an administrative presumption that you don't mean to give up US citizenship when you: become a citizen of another country, declare your allegiance to another country, join the military of a country that isn't at war with the US, or take a non-policy-level job with a foreign government. That means the State Department will assume you wanted to keep your citizenship unless you affirmatively, explicitly, and unequivocally say that you did not.In practice, if the issue comes up then the State Department will just ask you what your intention was and take you at your word. Unless you actually go to a US embassy or consulate and fill out a form saying I do not want to be a US citizen any more, you don't really have to worry about it."}
{"question":"Let's say I am arrested and I have a smartphone in my possession. A police officer cannot, without a warrant, seize my phone, unlock it and go through my pictures, messages, etc. The US Supreme Court unanimously concurred in Riley v. California. In such a case, a person who locks his phone is asserting a reasonable expectation of privacy and the 4th Amendment protects said person.Now lets say I am arrested and I have a non-password-protected smartphone in my possession. The phone is completely unlocked. By simply not setting a password or other lock screen, have I inadvertently waived my expectation of privacy?The closest court case Ive found is US Court of Appeals 6th circuit Huff v Spaw. The phone owner accidentally pocket-dialed another person. The court held (to paraphrase) that while the phone owner assumed an expectation of privacy, he did not exhibit the expectation of privacy because he did not take precautions to prevent pocket-dialing.Without a warrant, the police cannot enter your house, even if your closed front door is unlocked. But phones are not houses and the expectation of privacy is different. Im wondering if there are any court cases, laws, etc. that confirm or deny that I have (or dont have) a reasonable expectation of privacy if I choose to not password-protect my smartphone.","answer":"I'm not aware of case law on point, other than , which you mention (which doesn't mean that there isn't any - I'm not a specialist in this area). But, I think that the answer would be that you do have an expectation of privacy because the Riley holding that there was an expectation of privacy in a smart phone didn't really hinge in any meaningful way on the existence of a password. The linked summary of the Riley decision explains the court's reasoning as follows:  Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. wrote the opinion for the  unanimous Court. The Court held that the warrantless search exception  following an arrest exists for the purposes of protecting officer  safety and preserving evidence, neither of which is at issue in the  search of digital data. The digital data cannot be used as a weapon to  harm an arresting officer, and police officers have the ability to  preserve evidence while awaiting a warrant by disconnecting the phone  from the network and placing the phone in a 'Faraday bag.' The Court  characterized cell phones as minicomputers filled with massive amounts  of private information, which distinguished them from the traditional  items that can be seized from an arrestee's person, such as a wallet.  The Court also held that information accessible via the phone but  stored using 'cloud computing' is not even 'on the arrestee's person.'  Nonetheless, the Court held that some warrantless searches of cell  phones might be permitted in an emergency: when the government's  interests are so compelling that a search would be reasonable.    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. wrote an opinion concurring in part and  concurring in the judgment in which he expressed doubt that the  warrantless search exception following an arrest exists for the sole  or primary purposes of protecting officer safety and preserving  evidence. In light of the privacy interests at stake, however, he  agreed that the majority's conclusion was the best solution. Justice  Alito also suggested that the legislature enact laws that draw  reasonable distinctions regarding when and what information within a  phone can be reasonably searched following an arrest.The 4th Amendment expressly protects 'papers' in your possession, which can't be password protected, and a smart phone file is analogous to a 'paper' for 4th Amendment purposes. Your expectation of privacy in an unlocked smart phone flows from your exclusive possession of the phone as a piece of tangible personal property containing information, and not just from the password protection. In the same vein, I don't think that you would need to have a lock on a diary to have an expectation of privacy in it.This said, this is a cutting edge area of the law and password protection for a smart phone provides both more practical protection and potentially a less ambiguous cases of legal protection from search (since it brings you closer to the facts of Riley), and is therefore still a good idea."}

I know they allow citizens to purchase firearms, I'm well aware of that. And my question was what are we doing If I'm European","answer":"The United States federal government allows citizens and legal permanent residents to purchase fire arms.  Individual States will follow these rules as well, though the restrictions on purchase may differ from State to State, though this is not on grounds of citizen or resident status, it could factor into the difficulty of purchasing.  You may not purchase fire arms if you are convicted of a Felony or a misdemeanor domestic offense or a documented history of recent mental health concerns.  In other cases, there will typically be some court order baring you from purchase, but this is case by case.Furthermore, while you may not purchase firearms while on vacation to the United States, it may be possible to go to a gun range and legally fire a weapon owned by the range.  This could also depend on state by state, but I do know Hawaii has a large market of ranges that cater to Japanese Tourists who want to do just that on their American Vacations.  Generally these would exist in areas with high foreign tourists locations, though may be off the beaten path as they tend to be in more rural parts of the state than the touristy parts."}

Yes, he can. See , 214 S.W.3d 159. The critical question was whether the defendant understood the charges (he did) and whether he could assist in his defense (he could).

A government expert witness 'testified that appellant had permanent retrograde amnesia and would not be able to aid in his own defense in terms of remembering any of the acts alleged in the indictment'. The crucial difference seems to be whether one just has loss of memory, vs. loss of memory connected with some other mental disorder.[Addendum]Per , competence to stand trial depends on whether the accused  has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a  reasonable degree of rational understanding -- and whether he has a  rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against  him.I am not aware of any exceptions e.g. whether this is not the case with strict liability crimes like statutory rape, and since it is generally held that 'competency' is a requirement mandated by the due process clause, I don't think there could be an exception."}

{"question":"When I first started making music several years ago I used a service called Music Kickup; they're based in Helsinki, Finland and I am based in California, US. They take music I send them, put it on streaming platforms (spotify, apple music, etc.), and when I make money from people streaming me, those streaming services send the royalties to music kickup, then music kickup pays me. The whole 'paying me' part is what's getting hung up here. They have not paid me since fall of 2016. You can look at , accessed at the time of posting this. Section 4 of Music Kickup's licensing agreement says this about payments, I am considered the licensor here:Music KickUp shall provide the Licensor with a report of the sale of  the Licensors Recordings via Music KickUp Distribution Service and of  the accrued royalties. Music KickUp shall post the report to the  Licensors Music KickUp Account within a reasonable time from Music  KickUps receipt of such reports from the Distributors.Royalties and other related income accrued from the digital  distribution of the Licensors Recordings and received by Music KickUp  from the Distributors (hereinafter referred to as Royalties) shall  be credited to the Licensors Music KickUp Account within ninety (90)  days from the receipt of such Royalties by Music KickUp.

Music KickUp shall not be responsible for any delay or neglect of  payment by Distributors or other third parties.You can read . I'm also entirely certain this is not a delay on behalf of third parties. Spotify, Apple Music, have always been quick to pass my royalties on to other distributors I've used before. I've emailed Music Kickup several times and have either been told that they're fixing it and my payments 'will be available soon' (they never are) or they will just flat out stop responding.

{"question":"Some US states such as California and New York go to great lengths to keep former residents part of their tax base. As an example, New York continues to consider an individual to be domiciled in NY until and unless that individual establishes a permanent domicile elsewhere.And (with few exceptions) if New York considers you to be domiciled in NY, you are considered a resident and must pay state tax on your worldwide income. This is distinct from individuals who have to pay state tax on NY source income.Bottom line: if New York considers you a resident, you must pay state taxes on worldwide income, even if you did not set foot in NY or in any way have a connection to NY during the tax year.Example: John Q. Smith lives in NY and pays taxes for five years. For all of 2015 he is outside of NY and couch surfs around the US without establishing a permanent domicile. He does not return to NY after 2015. New York considers him to still be domiciled in NY for 2015 and therefore he must pay NY state tax on all of his worldwide income for 2015.Smith objects and faces off with New York in court. The first question would be what court(s) would have jurisdiction. New York would love it to be heard in state court and just cite their state tax law as their authority to tax Smith. And Smith wants it to be heard in federal court, but can't sue the state due to the Eleventh Amendment. So is that it, end of ballgame for Smith? The case is heard in NY, New York state law is the authority cited, Smith gets a state judgement against him and he has no way to appeal it outside of the state's jurisdiction?And the second question, assuming somehow the case gets to federal court or another state's court: Smith argues he had no connection to New York during 2015 and shouldn't have to pay New York state taxes. New York state counters his argument with: 'We have the authority to tax John Q. Smith under the legal theory __________________________'. What would that legal theory be? Has this been tested in court?Please do not give practical answers or workarounds that would short-circuit the process before they get to court. This is a hypothetical question on legal theory, not an actual case I'm trying to resolve.","answer":"On a certain level, it doesn't really matter which court hears the case, because New York's imposition of tax on a potential nonresident is a question of due process.If he lands in a New York state court, he still raises the same constitutional challenge. If it is successful, it doesn't matter what the state law says. Even if the state court just says, 'Suck it; you're in New York so you pay according to New York law,' he of course still has the opportunity to appeal that judgment to the U.S. Supreme Court once he's exhausted his appeals in state court.On the second question, the basic idea is that you can't be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of one of those states (or D.C., Puerto Rico, etc.). We determine which state you're a citizen of based on domicile, so until a New York citizen sets up somewhere other than New York, he's stuck with New York citizenship. This concept is fundamental to a lot of different areas of law, and New York's approach is not at all unique.I don't have a case to cite to at the moment, but this has definitely been tested in court. The general principle is well accepted, though there are certainly occasions where states are brushed back for interpreting it too aggressively."}
{"question":"This is a question that was raised after watching several TV series on streaming services.  It revolves around the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and activity of USAMRIID on US Soil and whether legally they can be deployed or can act within the United States in the event of a major viral outbreak or other type of situation where they and their scientists are the 'front lines' of a major Biosafety Level 3\/4 outbreak domestically.Origin of the QuestionA 1995 movie called \"Outbreak\" details a fictional viral outbreak of an infinitely lethal pathogen.  This pathogen essentially infects an entire town and USAMRIID and US Military are deployed to cordon off the town and act alongside CDC to help identify and then attempt to create an antigen for this fictional pathogen.  However, there was a US Army military cordon used in the movie to isolate the affected town.Two seasons of a series called \"The Hot Zone\" exist (based on actual real life events, i.e. Ebola Reston and Amerithrax responses and investigations), the first one detailing the Ebola Reston situation where there was an Ebola outbreak in Reston at an animal quarantine place holding monkeys.  USAMRIID deployed during that first season to sterilize the facility, neutralize the monkeys, and get samples of Ebola Reston to USAMRIID for study.  They operated as a military operation to get in, sterilize the threats, and get out without being seen, however as everyone involved was USAMRIID, they were technically military, so it stands to reason they are not permitted to deploy domestically.The QuestionWe know that the Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1385) limits the ability for the federal government to deploy US military personnel to enforce domestic laws and policies within the US.  However, while USAMRIID is a US Military operation out of Fort Detrick, there still seems to be a lot of movies showing USAMRIID deploying in response to domestic biosafety level 3 and level 4 situations, adn then in turn acting in regards to those situations.I know these movies are dramatizations, and not based in actual US legal cases at times, however I know that USAMRIID along with CDC personnel were involved in eradicating the Ebola Reston 'outbreak' before it spread beyond the quarantine facility.Does USAMRIID operate outside the Posse Comitatus Act, in that they can coordinate and act on US soil in response to biological threat situations, or are they bound by Posse Comitatus and are not allowed to act to enforce biosafety in the event of outbreaks of BL4 agents like ebola or other filoviruses?This question is looking for answers based in law and precedent related to Posse Comitatus and whether it affects USAMRIID specific activities states-side in response to biosafety situations.  Precedents to support statements are desired in this case.","answer":"The article  analyzes the legal restrictions on use of military power arising from that act. Following, 419 F. Supp. 186, where the act played a role in trials related to Wounded Knee, it was found and subsequently supported in various ruling that theuse which is prohibited by the posse comitatus statute is that whichis regulatory, proscriptive or compulsory in nature, and causes thecitizens to be presently or prospectively subject to regulations,proscriptions, or compulsions imposed by military authority.Mere involvement of deployment of the military is not contrary to the act. It should also be noted that the act includes a provision for actions expressly authorized by Congress, as was the case of the Espionage Act of 1917 and the related Magnuson Act of 1950.Hypothetically (in extremis), Congress might pass a law requiring the seizure of persons infected with a disease. If Congress expressly authorized USAMRIID to effect such seizures, that would not be in violation of the act. Otherwise, it would be. Since USAMRIID is a research lab and not an enforcement arm of the military, it is both highly unlikely that Congress would authorize such activities or that USAMRIID would get involved in this way. W.r.t. their ordinary operations, scientific research, nothing in what they do that contradicts the Posse Comitatus Act.Since we are dealing in hypotheticals, I should point out that SCOTUS has so far not definitively endorsed the regulatory, proscriptive or compulsory test, so that test could be overturned, though it is unlikely to be."}
{"question":"If a native English speaking person on trial decides to exercise his right of freedom of speech by speaking in a foreign language (i.e. Chinese), does the court have to hire a translator?","answer":"Not necessarily. The right to a translator is derived from the 5th, 6th and 14th Amendments, and the prohibition against discrimination based on national origin (the Civil Rights Act). However, SCOTUS noted in, 434 F. 2d 386, defendant was not afforded a translator throughout the trial, and the court found that  The least we can require is that a court, put on notice of a defendant's severe  language difficulty, make unmistakably clear to him that he has a  right to have a competent translator assist him, at state expense if  need be, throughout his trialThe question which the court has to ask and answer is whether the defendant is capable of competently assisting in his defense were the trial conducted in English. If a person is perfectly bilingual in English and Mien but decides to testify in Mien to be annoying, the court will not pander to the defendant's desire to be annoying. If the person has a weak grip on English and can more effectively testify in Mien, then (after cogent arguments to that effect) the defendant should be provided a translator. The question that the court has to address is necessity."}
{"question":"In France, you can pay a yearly fee to an organisation called  and use copyrighted works to make profit in various ways.Is there an equivalent in the USA?","answer":"Yes, there are equivalent rights clearinghouse organizations in the U.S. The most prominent are ASCAP and BMI. These organizations collect royalties (including mechanical license fees) for muscial works in much the same way that SACEM does in France. ASCAP and BMI also collect royalties for SACEM artists when their works are performed in the U.S. and vice versa through reciprocal agreements.It's worth clarifying that you are not paying a subscription fee to the organization, exactly; you are still paying an artist's royalty. The clearinghouse just streamlines the process and manages the payments."}
{"question":"From reading on the USPTO website, a trademark seems to go through a standard series of stages: filing, examination, publication, registration.

The final registration date?If a hypothetical company was infringing this trademark for a period of time after the filing date, but before the final registration date they ceased completely, could this company be sued?","answer":"You have a trademark before it is registered, even before the registration process is started, by the fact that you are using the name. Therefore you can sue at any time. The defendant will find it easier to avoid damages because they were not aware of your trademark. The plaintiff will find it harder to prove the existence of the trademark. But in principle, you can be sued at any time.

This was the wrong answer. I was told that this is a trick question and that I should pay attention to punctuation\/grammar.Please tell me which answer is correct and why in detail. Also, tell me why (a) is wrong.","answer":"There are two ways to figure out the right answer. First, in both cases, you eliminate three answers that are clearly incorrect:If the property is not used for hunting during A's lifetime, A can pass it to A's heirs, so it is not a life estate.There is no life estate prior to A's interest, so it is not a remainder interest.The existence of one or more conditions means that it is not a fee simple absolute.Then, there are two possible ways (shown in bold) to determine whether (a) or (b) is correct:All fee simple estates subject to conditions are defeasible fee simple estates.A fee simple subject to condition subsequent, is one that gives the grantor the option to revoke the grant if the condition occurs, but is not self-executing. This conveyance, in contrast, is self-executing. If there is hunting, then the condition takes effect, without any affirmative action on the party of the grantor. So, it is not a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.It could have been a fee simple determinable, but in that estate, the property must revert to the owner by operation of law if the condition occurs, while the first condition in this case actually causes the property to go to B and not to O.The correct subtype of defeasible fee simple estate in this case is called a fee simple subject to executory limitation, but since a fee simple subject to executory limitation is a subtype of defeasible fee simple estate, answer (b) is correct.To the extent that it is a trick question, it is a trick question because four of the options (a), (c), (d) and (e) are possibilities at one level of specificity, and (b) is a possibility at a more general level of specificity.If the answer were that it was a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, then both (a) and (b) would be true, because (a) is a subtype of (b), which isn't possible in this kind of multiple choice format. So, (a) cannot be true."}
{"question":"This is one of a few questions I will ask.  I understand that no one can give legally binding advice and I am not asking for it.  I am looking primarily for information and terminology I need to better research the actual laws relevant, I don't presume anything told to me is legally binding.I have a friend, let's call her Alice, who was raped by a police officer, let's call him Bob.  She went to the police and made a report, in which she also stated that she wished he was dead out of anger.  Alice ultimately did not press charges.Bob, now states that the officer to whom Alice gave the statement, informed him of her statement in detail.  My understanding is that, without charges filed, the officer could not repeat any of the statement to Bob?  Is the officer allowed to provide details of this statement to the accused?  I know the officer promised the statement would not be repeated at that time.If she isn't allowed, what sort of legal options are available for Alice to seek to have the breach of privacy punished? Alice was already afraid of making a report, due to fear that police officers would side together. This violation of her privacy is making it far less likely she will trust the legal system enough to file charges for the rape. So, I would like to be able to assure her that she has some means of seeking punishment for this, to show her that the legal system is still on her side and the police can't just collaborate against her. Any idea of what option one might pursue that I can research in more depth? ","answer":"The misunderstandingThe only person who can chose to prosecute or not to prosecute a criminal case is the state: in the US this is through the office of the relevant District Attorney advised by the police.When a person makes a complaint to police (or other authorities), the police\/DA commence an investigation. In an ideal world all complaints would be investigated rigorously and thoroughly, however, we live in this world. The police\/DA will assess the complaint and decide if it warrants the dedication of scarce resources to investigate. One of the factors they will consider is how vigorously the complainant prods them in the ass.Ultimately, the police\/DA will decide if there is enough evidence to place the matter before the courts. The complainant has no say in when or if this will happen.A complainant cannot 'drop the charges'!The misconductFor a police officer to disclose to another police officer that they were the subject of a felony (or any) complaint is gross misconduct and a huge betrayal of trust.

{"question":"Since suicide is not a crime in many states is there any requirement for anyone to do something about an individual who is attempting suicide?  That is to say does anyone, other then perhaps a therapist, have an obligation to prevent a suicide?  Could a police officer, for example, stand by and watch a suicide occur without being guilty of a crime by not acting to prevent it?  For that matter could a member of a hospital allow it to occur without violating their legal responsibilities?","answer":"A police officer (or any other random person) would not be guilty of a crime or subject to civil liability for standing by and watching a suicide occur when it could be prevented, unless the person attempting to commit suicide was in his custody and he failed to take reasonable care to prevent a suicide in which case the officer could be subject to civil liability. It would not be a violation of the law, however, for a police officer (or in most cases, even a private citizen) to intervene to attempt to stop an attempted suicide. Likewise, prisons and prison guards can have civil liability for failing to prevent the suicide of someone in their custody. Of course, a police officer might still receive a negative employment evaluation from his supervisor for such conduct, or might even be fired for it depending on the rules of a particular department, as it would reflect poorly on the police department and show bad judgment on the officers part.In general, an affirmative duty enforceable by a lawsuit to take reasonable efforts to prevent someone from committing suicide applies in circumstances where the person attempting to commit suicide is in someone else's care and custody and has their liberty constrained. So, there could be liability on the part of a hospital or treating medical personnel (I've actually brought such a case that was dismissed due to malpractice in missing a deadline by local co-counsel who was then disciplined for ethical violations by the State of Illinois for his conduct.) In the absence of such a relationship, a legal duty to take affirmative action to prevent a suicide generally does not arise.Certain medical facilities and providers are required to make anonymized incident reports for the purpose of creating national public health statistics on a periodic basis.In certain extreme circumstances, there are duties to report someone who is a threat to others which may also include a risk of suicide, to authorities, but those are quite narrowly interpreted, and actual legal consequences from failing to warn are very rare.There may be other reporting requirements in educational institutions and for mental health professionals, but I am not personally aware of them and I do not believe that they are national in scope.Usually, for criminal liability, there would have to be actual affirmative acts to aid or to attempt to cause a suicide."}
{"question":"From the  it states:On May 25, 2016,  Myers ordered portions of the video released. The released video omits the shooting itself.The full unedited body camera footage of the shooting was unsealed by the Court immediately after the end of the trial.It seems out of place that there would be video evidence of the crime in questioning happening, but the actual shooting was omitted while other parts of the video were released. Isn't the actual moment of the shooting the most important part of the video?Was this to prevent bias? Why was the video evidence of the not used in the case?","answer":"The non-release of video evidence prior to the trial's completion would be to prevent potential jurors from being tainted, because jurors are required to obtain their knowledge of the facts of the case solely from what is presented to them at trial. Someone who saw the full video prior to the trial would be ineligible to serve as a juror in the case in much the same way that witnesses of a crime can not serve on the jury in a trial arising from that crime.The fact that he was acquitted meant that the case could never be retried. If he was not acquitted, the video probably would have stayed under seal until all possible appeals were exhausted to prevent jurors on any possible retrial from being tainted. The Wikipedia link in the OP notes that:   In March 2018, it became known that the United States Department of  Justice has reopened the case and is looking into a possible civil  rights violation by Brailsford.Finding jurors in that case may be somewhat more difficult as a result, although the more remote time period and the larger jury pool area of a federal court, may make it possible to find jurors unfamiliar with this video. If not, the defendant may move to change the venue of the case to a court less familiar with the case.You are incorrect in your belief that the video evidence was not used in the case. The fact that the video was 'under seal' doesn't imply that it wasn't used at trial. This just means that it can't be released to anyone other than the prosecution team and the defense team other than at trial and that it can't be released by anyone present at the trial until the case is no longer under seal.In fact, the full video was the highlight of the trial. According to  of the trial:  Last year's fatal shooting of a Texas man by Arizona police was caught  on body-camera video and showed him sobbing with his hands up, begging  for his life in his final moments.

This is because, as a practical matter, there is no way to separate business entities from individuals when it comes to marketing and solicitations. This is because one person can be a business entity (corporation, LLC, etc.)"}
{"question":"I was reading an article about  and it mentions her challenging a will on the basis that there was an earlier will with a clause invalidating any later wills.Is such a clause enforceable, say in USA jurisdiction? Of course, glad to have comments from other nations as well. Will be interesting to compare.","answer":"In , the authenticity of a mutual will was in question.Hetty Green (Robinson) claimed that her aunt (Howland) intended to disinherit the father of Robinson and requested that they were both to make a will, so that in case Howland predeceased Robinson but Robinson predeceased her father, the latter would not obtain anything derived from Howland's estate via Robinson.At the centre of the case is the allegation thatit was at the same time mutually agreedbetween the parties that the respective wills, so tobe made, were to be exchanged, and that each wasto have possession of the will of the other, and thatneither was to make any other will without notifyingthe other, and returning the other's will so to beheld in exchange.This is essentially a contract between (at the time) two living persons, and at least at the time, generally enforceable unless there exist motives to nullify the contract. Of course, the parties can also revoke the contracts according to the rules in the contract or provided by statutes.The court made the following observation (among others):Where twopersons agree each with the other to make mutualwills, and both execute the agreement, it is held thatneither can properly revoke his will without givingnotice to the other of such revocation. The death ofone of the parties in such a case carries his part ofthe contract into execution, and the better opinionperhaps is, that the other party, after that event, ifthe agreement was definite and satisfactory, cannotrescind the contract.The particular contract here would be irrevocably executed by one party due to her death and the contract is definitive and cannot be changed.However, in this case, it was decided against Robinson because the existence of the mutual will was not proved.By contrast, a traditional will is a unilateral declaration made by the testator, who in general cannot bind their future self from making another legally valid decision overriding the previous will, unless another party's interests are adversely impacted under certain conditions (e.g. under proprietary estoppel) or the law provides otherwise in that jurisdiction. \/>Nowadays in Massachusetts,  provide for methods to revoke a will as well as contracts regarding the making or non-making of a will that could make certain wills irrevocable.Section 2507. [Revocation by Writing or by Act.](a) A will or any part thereof is revoked:(1) by executing a subsequent will that revokes the previous will orpart expressly or by inconsistency; or(2) by performing a revocatory act on the will, if the testatorperformed the act with the intent and for the purpose of revoking thewill or part or if another individual performed the act in thetestator's conscious presence and by the testator's direction. Forpurposes of this paragraph, ''revocatory act on the will'' includesburning, tearing, canceling, obliterating, or destroying the will orany part of it.(b) If a subsequent will does not expressly revoke a previous will,the execution of the subsequent will wholly revokes the previous willby inconsistency if the testator intended the subsequent will toreplace rather than supplement the previous will.(c) The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will toreplace rather than supplement a previous will if the subsequent willmakes a complete disposition of the testator's estate. If thispresumption arises and is not rebutted, the previous will is revoked;only the subsequent will is operative on the testator's death.(d) The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will tosupplement rather than replace a previous will if the subsequent willdoes not make a complete disposition of the testator's estate. If thispresumption arises and is not rebutted, the subsequent will revokesthe previous will only to the extent the subsequent will isinconsistent with the previous will; each will is fully operative onthe testator's death to the extent they are not inconsistent.Section 2514. [Contracts Concerning Succession.]A contract to make or not to make a will or devise, or to revoke or not to revoke a will or devise, or to die intestate, if executed after the effective date of this article, may be established only by (i) provisions of a will stating material provisions of the contract, (ii) an express reference in a will to a contract and extrinsic evidence proving the terms of the contract, or (iii) a writing signed by the decedent evidencing the contract. The execution of a joint will or mutual wills shall not create a presumption of a contract not to revoke the will or wills."}
{"question":"I received $750 in SSI until May 2018, plus $130 in SNAP, and every year, they ask if I'm paying room rental. Then my mother usually signed an 801 form. However, this was the first time I heard about that since the investigator who was working on my case was different from the one who usually called me in the past.As of March 2017 to April 2018, I haven't been able to pay my parents who are head of the household because I had endured severe medical hardship, and then I accumulated credit card debts so I could survive, and I am currently paying for phone and internet, and, because I'm blind, I take cabs a lot, like Uber and Lyft. I also buy my own groceries and meals.Since the house is being mortgaged, and the money I should be paying would help them pay for it, was I legally obligated to pay them in any way?Since my mother told Social Security that I wasn't paying rent, my SSI was cut, which made it more problematic for me to get out of credit card debt, plus twenty months of rent.However, my attorney and I have a hearing in a few days and are going to argue Nobody from Social Security, until that investigator called me in March 2018, told me that I had some obligation to pay rent, or that they were also required to go and confirm it with my parents.Similarly, my mother's telling me to pay her could be considered hearsay since it was second-hand information.As far as I know, I had never signed any 801 forms until April 2018.On Friday, 17 February 2017, I asked the investigator who was checking up on me if I needed to report any new credit cards I opened.

{"question":"I watched  recently which depicted the following situation, and I'd like to learn more about what peoples' rights are and what an officer's obligations are in a situation like this:A filming crew flew a drone above property to photograph a private business operation.The security for that private business followed the filming crew down the road, and soon a police vehicle showed up, passed the security vehicle and pulled over the crew. The initial encounter went as follows:Officer: 'Good morning folks, (identification), just trying to- had  some people ask questions why you're flying a drone over their  property.' Driver: (silence)Officer: 'You guys got any ID on you?'Driver: 'Why am I being stopped?'Officer: 'You're being stopped because people identified your vehicle  as flying a drone over the top of their property and we're just trying  to figure out what you guys are up to.'Driver: 'That's illegal?'Officer: 'Well they just wanted to know who you were, they couldn't  identify who you were. Do you guys have any identification on you?'Now, the easiest thing to do here is obviously show ID. But my question is: Has the officer fulfilled the conditions necessary in order to demand ID at this point? My concern is this: The officer could be friends with the owner of the facility they were photographing and helping his pal out by going get the name of the people photographing their operation. The law (in most US states) states that an officer can only demand you show ID if you're suspected of committing a crime. Right? That's to keep officers from being able to pull over and annoy anyone they don't like or have a personal or monetary motive to harass. Right? So it seems to me the officer couldn't identify a specific crime the driver had broken, and would be required to name the specific law broken. But I don't know that for sure, which is why I'm here. Is the officer obligated to name the specific law the driver broke before demanding ID, if the driver requests to know which law they broke? To continue the transaction where it left off:Driver: 'So because they wanna know who we are, you're going to tell  them?' Officer: 'Well I'm just going to ask you- I'm asking if you have any  identification.'Driver: 'I do. What crime am I suspected of committing?'Officer: 'Well, I'm just asking to see your identification Sir. I'm  trying to identify you. Driver: 'I'm telling you no.'At this point the officer has failed to name a specific law the driver is suspected of breaking. Does he need to in order to demand ID? The officer doesn't seem to know what law he suspects the driver of breaking, so he goes back to his squad car and presumably investigates. He claims to speak to his supervisor. Presumably, at this point the supervisor would look up a specific law to suspect the driver of breaking right? So it seems to me like the officer has two options: Return to the vehicle and say 'You've been suspected of X (specific law broken) crime, I need to see  your ID'or 'You're free to go'.Anyway, that doesn't happen. The detainment goes on for an hour and the driver continues to request to know what crime he's suspected of and refuse to show ID until the officer identifies the crime he's suspected of committing.  another officer even states 'There is no crime.' in response to the driver asking 'Why can't you tell me what the crime was?' This continues until the officers place the driver and passengers under arrest and bring them to jail.I see these kinds of videos often, and often times its clear the driver is just trying to cause unnecessary drama, but in a few cases, like this one, it seems to me like the driver is genuinely trying not to forfeit rights designed to protect citizens from harassment. I'm no legal expert though, and I'm not claiming to be right. I'm asking for an expert explanation of what rights a person has in this situation, what obligations the officer has, and whether or not this encounter was ultimately a legal \/ illegal detainment and arrest. ","answer":"There are a variety of situations like border crossings, entry into official buildings, etc. in which there is a general right for law enforcement to demand identification on a suspicionless basis, none of which seem to apply in this case.But, the most common justification for demanding ID is to make what is called a  (after the name of the U.S. Supreme Court case that upheld the legality of these stops in the face of 4th Amendment limitations on searches and seizures). Wikipedia accurately summarizes the law in this area as follows. A Terry stop is:  a brief detention of a person by police on reasonable suspicion of  involvement in criminal activity but short of probable cause to  arrest.    The name derives from Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), in which the  Supreme Court of the United States held that police may briefly detain  a person whom they reasonably suspect is involved in criminal  activity; the Court also held that police may do a limited search of  the suspect's outer garments for weapons if they have a reasonable and  articulable suspicion that the person detained may be 'armed and  dangerous'.    To have reasonable suspicion that would justify a stop, police must be  able to point to 'specific and articulable facts' that would indicate  to a reasonable police officer that the person stopped is, or is about  to be, engaged in criminal activity (as opposed to past conduct).  Reasonable suspicion depends on the 'totality of the circumstances',  and can result from a combination of facts, each of which is by itself  innocuous.    The search of the suspect's outer garments, also known as a patdown,  must be limited to what is necessary to discover weapons; however,  pursuant to the 'plain view' doctrine, police may seize contraband  discovered in the course of a frisk, but only if the contraband's  identity is immediately apparent.    In some jurisdictions, persons detained under the doctrine of Terry  must identify themselves to police upon request. In Hiibel v. Sixth  Judicial District Court of Nevada, 542 U.S. 177 (2004), the Court held  that a Nevada statute requiring such identification did not violate  the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and  seizures, nor, in the circumstances of that case, the Fifth  Amendment's privilege against self incrimination.New York is  that has a stop and identify statute, that allows an officer to insist on presentation of an identification any time there is a legal basis for making a Terry stop. The New York stop and identify statute is N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7140.50. This says:  1.?In addition to the authority provided by this article for making an arrest without a warrant, a police officer may stop a person in a  public place located within the geographical area of such officer's  employment when he reasonably suspects that such person is committing,  has committed or is about to commit either (a) a felony or (b) a  misdemeanor defined in the penal law, and may demand of him his name,  address and an explanation of his conduct.    2.?Any person who is a peace officer and who provides security services for any court of the unified court system may stop a person  in or about the courthouse to which he is assigned when he reasonably  suspects that such person is committing, has committed or is about to  commit either (a) a felony or (b) a misdemeanor defined in the penal  law, and may demand of him his name, address and an explanation of his  conduct.    3.?When upon stopping a person under circumstances prescribed in subdivisions one and two a police officer or court officer, as the  case may be, reasonably suspects that he is in danger of physical  injury, he may search such person for a deadly weapon or any  instrument, article or substance readily capable of causing serious  physical injury and of a sort not ordinarily carried in public places  by law-abiding persons. ?If he finds such a weapon or instrument, or  any other property possession of which he reasonably believes may  constitute the commission of a crime, he may take it and keep it until  the completion of the questioning, at which time he shall either  return it, if lawfully possessed, or arrest such person.    4.?In cities with a population of one million or more, information that establishes the personal identity of an individual who has been  stopped, questioned and\/or frisked by a police officer or peace  officer, such as the name, address or social security number of such  person, shall not be recorded in a computerized or electronic database  if that individual is released without further legal action;  ?provided, however, that this subdivision shall not prohibit police  officers or peace officers from including in a computerized or  electronic database generic characteristics of an individual, such as  race and gender, who has been stopped, questioned and\/or frisked by a  police officer or peace officer.In this particular case, if the law enforcement officer were more clever, he would have said that he was concerned that the crew might be using the drone to case the property in order to commit a crime there in the future. And, if he had said that, this would surely pass muster for reasonable suspicion for a Terry stop and would have provided a legal justification for demanding ID. The 'about to commit a crime' justification for a Terry stop makes it, in practice, much broader than probable cause for an arrest, which requires that the police believe that a crime has actually already been committed or is in progress, not just that someone is about to commit a crime (a person may be subjected to a Terry stop even if his actions which tend to show he is about to commit a crime have not yet progressed to the level of an attempted offense for which someone may be convicted and are not truly imminent).(Actually, strictly speaking, the officer is only entitled to determine the information that an ID would reveal, and not to insist that someone actually have the ID on his person, under state law, although a local ordinance or court interpretation of the law could possibly give him the authority to actually demand an ID to determine this information. For example, California courts have held that a duty to provide basic information implies a duty to provide it in a verifiable manner.)The fact that the law enforcement officer failed to articulate any legal basis for the stop, yet went on to arrest the individuals, weakens the case that the stop was valid considerably, because generally, at least in theory, a law enforcement officer is supposed to be able to articulate the reasonable suspicion for the stop at the time that the stop is made and not days later after the fact.In addition to stop and identify laws, some states (including Colorado) have held that failing to provide an ID on demand, under the 'totality of the circumstances' can sometimes constitute obstructing a police officer and provide a basis for an arrest. It isn't inconceivable that a law enforcement officer in this situation could make that argument and prevail at least in showing probable cause for arrest on that basis, even if it wasn't a sufficiently solid argument to give rise to an obstructing a police officer conviction."}

After a DNA sample was surreptitiously collected from the door handle of DeAngelo's car, it was matched with samples related to the Golden State Killer's crimes.? However, according to the UK's  (BFEG):This process of uploading DNA from a crime scene in the Golden State killer case to GEDmatch violated the terms and conditions of use. These terms stated that the person submitting the DNA had to declare that; it was their own DNA; or they were the legal guardian of the DNA donor; or they were otherwise authorised.But I cannot see if this was ever challenged by DeAngelo's defence.The BFEG goes on to say that different sites and different jurisdictions have different requirements:23andMe, AncestryDNA and MyHeritage do not allow law enforcement use of their databases without a warrant. FamilyTreeDNA offers an opt-out from law enforcement matching possibility, and all European users are automatically opted out in line with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Jurisidiction: UK, US, Italy.","answer":"LegalNo.   I'm not aware of the specifics outside of the United States, but all three jurisdictions have protections for freedom of speech and this statement typically does not constitute a 'true threat' to commit a crime.   In the United States, the officer needs to also consider the context under which a statement is made.   'I wish I could be sharp enough to steal billions' said by a comedian on stage would more likely than not indicate the comedian is going to talk about a stupid criminal who was busted for something related to not thinking through the crime.

If the cop has a valid reason to believe you might actually rob a bank, he can arrest you... an arrest does not mean you are guilty of the crime accused, so if it was proven in error or over zealously done, it will not affect you in the long run and in the U.S. you may be compensated for the inconvenience."}

{"question":"I'm confused by hold-over clauses as they apply to the rental of a property. What is the intent? Originally I thought they were so the landlord can increase the rent to a very high amount to put pressure on the tenant to hurry up and move out. Though I sometimes see hold-over where the rent and the lease is the same.So what's the difference between a hold-over an an auto-renewing lease, or a lease that automatically switches to month-to-month after a certain date?If a lease clearly indicates that the tenants must vacate the property on a certain date, and they do not do so, this is already a violation of the contract so what's the point of having a holdover clause? In Canada it's extremely difficult to physically remove a person and their possessions (a judge is required to appoint a bailiff). Out of curiosity, in the US (in places like Texas) is a court order needed to physically remove a person after the lease ends? ","answer":"  Originally I thought they were so the landlord can increase the rent  to a very high amount to put pressure on the tenant to hurry up and  move out.Sometimes this is the intent. For example, this was the intent the lease from the office I moved out of earlier this month where the holdover clause doubled the rent during a holdover period. In this cases, it provides a less messy and more flexible alternative to an eviction action to get a tenant to leave voluntarily, while compensating a landlord, without court action, when the tenant just can't leave quite on time for some reason like an inability to get movers scheduled by the lease termination date.   So what's the difference between a hold-over an an auto-renewing  lease, or a lease that automatically switches to month-to-month after  a certain date?There isn't a difference. Those are just different varieties of holdover clauses.  If a lease clearly indicates that the tenants must vacate the property  on a certain date, and they do not do so, this is already a violation  of the contract so what's the point of having a holdover clause?Most of the time, a landlord and a tenant with a fixed term lease intend the lease to continue indefinitely and establish an end of the lease term primarily to give the parties an opportunity to renegotiate the terms of their mutual arrangement without either party having a status quo advantage. A conversion to a month to month lease does basically the same thing.In that kind of context, neither party wants to force the termination of an otherwise fruitful economic relationship simply because someone didn't bother to check the fine print of a several year old lease in somebody's desk drawer.The purpose of a fixed lease term is that: (1) it allows the landlord to sue for lost rent until the premises can be released if the tenant leaves early, and (2) it allows the tenant to know that they can be secure in their right to use the property so long as the tenant complies with the lease term allowing the tenant to invest (in terms of marketing, tenant finish, etc.) in the premises. Once those mutual expectations are met, there is no need for a fixed term and a month to month, or autorenewing lease is fine.  In Canada it's extremely difficult to physically remove a person and  their possessions (a judge is required to appoint a bailiff). Out of  curiosity, in the US (in places like Texas) is a court order needed to  physically remove a person after the lease ends?It Is Not 'Extremely Difficult' To Physically Remove A Person And Their Possession From Rented Premises When A Lease Is Breached, Even In CanadaThe process you describe in Canada is essentially identical to the process in almost all U.S. states and it isn't that difficult. You give notice in compliance with statutory formality requirements to the tenant demanding that they move out and they don't. You file an eviction action in court (usually a local court of limited jurisdiction where filing fees are lower and the court docket moves more swiftly). The tenant has an opportunity to contest the eviction by a certain deadline which is fairly short, but has no viable legal grounds to do so if the rent wasn't paid or the lease term has ended, and the court orders the eviction either by default or following a short hearing that is held on an expedited basis. You make arrangements with the bailiff or equivalent official to remove someone pursuant to the court's order, and the job gets done. It takes maybe 4-10 hours of lawyer\/paralegal work plus the cost of making arrangements to physically remove the tenant's possessions from the premises, if there is no bona fide dispute over the end of the lease term or the fact that rent is owed.* Usually, those costs can be added to the amount that the tenant owes for unpaid rent and damages to the premises. Not infrequently, a tenant, seeing the inevitability of the situation, will consent to an order of possession in exchange for some extra time to move out or a waiver of some of the money owed to the landlord (as the tenant often has no ability to pay anyway and otherwise would have renegotiated the lease and paid the rent).As a senior lawyer, I spend very little time at all on routine cases where there is no bona fide dispute as to whether rent is owed or the lease term is terminated. Something like 90%-95% of my time that is devoted to landlord-tenant cases goes towards the 2%-5% of cases where there is a bona fide dispute concerning these matters, which can get messy, be protracted and is costly. For example, a recent landlord-tenant eviction case I handled had five copies of the lease floating around with different rents and different terms - four of which were forgeries, there was a dispute over whether rent was paid related to allegations that rent money had been embezzled, not all of the leased property was turned over to the tenant when the lease was commenced, there was a forebearance agreement which may or may not have been suspended, the landlord was being foreclosed upon for not paying its mortgage and was in bankruptcy as well, a key participant was a lawyer who had previously been disbarred for fabricating documents, and there were breaches of fiduciary duties related to the execution of the lease, all concerning a fifteen unit apartment building worth several million dollars that was sublet to individual tenants by a master tenant.Evictions Without A Court OrderThe predominant process to remove someone from leased premises is to get a court order in this fashion to evict someone after the lease ends, if they don't move out of their own free will. In a minority of U.S. states it isn't automatically unlawful to evict someone for non-payment of rent or the termination of a lease term without a court order, if it can be accomplished without a breach of the peace. But, in practice, the benefit of having a court order that provides a safe harbor against criminal and civil liability for a wrongful eviction is almost always worth it to a landlord, even when it is not legally required.Usually, even in states where evictions are allowed without a court order in some circumstances (e.g. Florida), this is only done in practice where the property has been abandoned by the tenant who may have left some possessions there but hasn't been in the premises for ages.Benefits Of Not Having A Holdover ClauseThis said, if you draft a lease without a holdover clause for a fairly short term, like a few months or a year, it does make the eviction proceeding more straight forward and certain, because it is unnecessary for the landlord to prove that rent is owed or another lease term was violated at the end of the term of the lease, in order to evict them. All that the landlord has to do is prove that the lease was entered into and that the term has expired, while the tenant would have to prove a modification or renewal of the lease (something that would ordinarily require the landlord's signature) to prevail. The landlord can then pursue any other monetary amount owed by the tenant separately once the tenant is gone.Also, if you have a fixed term lease with no holdover clause, the requirement that the landlord give notice to the tenant to vacate as the landlord would have to in a month to month lease, or in a case where rent is not paid, is often waived by statue or by a common law interpretation that the lease itself provides the notice in that context. So, this can remove one step from the eviction process in addition to making proof of the right to evict much simpler."}

(Literally, you can always ask, but sometimes the answer will be clearly no, as a matter of law.)Some presumptions of paternity are conclusive (either immediately or after a statute of limitations to contest paternity expires) and can't be overcome by contrary genetic evidence. Other presumptions of paternity are rebuttable. The specifics vary in important details from state to state.The theory behind the conclusive presumption is primarily that the presumed parent in those circumstances becomes the psychological parent, and it is not in the best interests of the child to dislodge a psychological parent, even if that parent is not a biological parents.Put another way, a conclusive presumption is really part of the definition of what a father is under the law.Several other answers at Law.SE have addressed this in the context of specific U.S. states.

Also for hypothetical's sake, let's assume there is no clause in the lease that defines any item's expected condition before or after the lease term.]","answer":"  Are they liable for repairs to the dishwasher when the lease is over?Yes, but that is because of the presumption that the proximate cause for the dishwasher breaking is its usage by the tenant or tenant's household.To overcome liability, the tenant would have to prove that the dishwasher broke prior to the start of the lease.  If it matters, the reason for not fixing something could be inability  to find a contractor or lack of funds to do so.That does not matter, unless any such exceptions are contemplated in the language of the contract.  let's assume there is no clause in the lease that defines any item's  expected condition before or after the lease termIn that case, the default expectation (and presumption) is that everything works fine before the lease, and the expectation is that everything will work fine at the end of the lease."}

{"question":".Suppose Alice Inc. was in this situation, in that they are a US company with their websites running on the cloud in US datacenters, let us say in a single docker container with apache and MySQL and their simple site.  They could with a simple purchase of alternative hosting and a few commands deploy their webserver on an EU host.  This would however have little effect on the access to the data, in that if US law enforcement turned up at the offices of Alice Inc. they could be required to hand over the data and their access to the data will not be changed in any way by the location of the web hosting.If they did this, would this satisfy the particular aspect of the GDPR that was covered by the 'Schrems II' decision and the Meta fine?","answer":"Maybe this changes something, maybe not. But at first glance, yes, avoiding US-based vendors does help comply with Schrems II. They need not be EU-based.Definition of an international data transferThe GDPR unfortunately does not define what an international transfer is, and just explains when they may be lawful:Art 44: Any transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country [\u2026] shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the controller and processor, including for onward transfers of personal data from the third country [\u2026] to another third country [\u2026]. [\u2026]This has been interpreted, in particular by the official EU SCCs and by , to imply two roles: the data exporter, and the data importer. Per those EDPB guidelines, a transfer occurs when three criteria are fulfilled together:The data exporter is subject to GDPR (e.g. as a controller via Art 3, or as a processor via an Art 28 data processing contract).The exporter discloses or makes available personal data to the importer.The importer is in a third country (for EU GDPR: anything outside the EU\/EEA).Note that these importer\/exporter aspects are independent from roles like controller or processor. It also does not depend on where in the world the exporter is situated.Applying this to your scenarioHow does this apply to your scenario?I am assuming Alice Inc is subject to the GDPR (criterion #1). Now, Alice Inc can process personal data, and that's not an international transfer, even if Alice Inc is in the US (or any other third country). The general GDPR rules apply, such as the requirement to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance and security of processing operations.If Alice Inc engages data processors to process personal data on Alice Inc's behalf, then this would fulfil criterion #2 (disclosure to a third party). For example, hosting providers generally act as data processors. Any other kind of data sharing (e.g. to other data processors) would also fall under this category. Tricky in an US context: while employees would be agents of Alice Inc and would not be separate recipients, contractors\/freelancers would also be potential data importers.If those data importers are based in the EU\/EEA, then criterion #3 is not fulfilled and there's no international transfer. For example, using an EU-based hosting providers would sidestep Chapter V of the GDPR completely.If those data importers are based outside of the EU\/EEA, then criterion #3 is triggered and we have an international transfer.Lawfulness of international data transfersWhen there is an international transfer, it must be adequately protected. In order of decreasing priority:country has an EU adequacy decisionappropriate safeguardsfor a group of companies: Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)Art 49 specific situationsWhat SCCs and BCRs do is to translate enough of the GDPR from statutory law into a contract to ensure adequate protection. But to be effective, they must actually be enforceable, and the data importer must actually be able to comply with those rules.In Schrems II, the CJEU found that the US (at that time) did not offer an adequate level of data protection, and that SCCs are probably invalid as well since importers cannot comply with both the SCCs and with US surveillance laws. Before using SCCs, it is effectively necessary to perform a transfer impact assessment (TIA) analyzing, among other things, the legal context of the importer's country. It may be possible to defuse this, for example by using supplemental security measures like end-to-end that prevent unlawful use of the data even if it falls into the wrong hands. However, such measures also tend to prevent intended use, especially in a cloud context.In the , the DPC finds:7.202 In summary, therefore, I am satisfied (and I so find) that:(1) US law does not provide a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to that provided by EU law;<br \/>(2) Neither the 2010 SCCs nor the 2021 SCCs can compensate for the inadequate protection provided by US law; and<br \/>(3) Meta Ireland does not have in place any supplemental measures which wouldcompensate for the inadequate protection provided by US law.7.203 Accordingly, in making the Data Transfers, I find that, subject to the analysis contained at Section 8 below, Meta Ireland is infringing Article 46(1) GDPR.Implications of using non-US vendorsAs already mentioned, using EU-based data processors avoids the international transfer problem due to the way how international transfers are defined.Even if an international transfer occurs, that might not be a problem.Some countries have an EU adequacy decision, for example Canada, Israel, or South Korea. While there would nominally be an international data transfer that needs to be disclosed e.g. in a privacy notice, there is no additional bureaucracy required.In other countries, transfer tools like SCCs might work. A TIA might show that that the issues discussed in the Schrems II decision and the DPC decision wouldn't apply there.But isn't that a contradiction?You correctly point out a problem with the GDPR's approach to data transfers:This would however have little effect on the access to the data, in that if US law enforcement turned up at the offices of Alice Inc. they could be required to hand over the data and their access to the data will not be changed in any way by the location of the web hosting.Yes, this is arguably a loophole.However:If the US-based Alice Inc is a data processor in behalf of another controller, that controller would likely be violating the GDPR by transferring personal data to Alice.If Alice Inc is a data controller: while this might not be a violation of the Chapter V rules on international data transfers, such a scenario could be argued to be an Art 24 or Art 32 violation instead (requirement to ensure compliance and security).When Alice Inc transfers personal data to data importers, that is less visible to data subjects, and outside of their immediate control. However, when Alice Inc collects data on data subjects, that is more visible to data subjects, in particular through an Art 13 or Art 14 privacy notice. That notice must also contain the identity of the data controller, which would disclose that Alice is US-based, which may enable to data subjects to make more informed choices.This won't help MetaWhile moving to non-US data processors can be a sensible compliance approach for many companies, it is less useful for multinationals like Meta. In this context, Meta is an Irish data controller who engages platform and development services from an American company. Even if Meta Ireland tries to perform all GDPR-covered processing activities outside the US, it's actual corporate structure situates some processing activities such as administration tasks in the US and other third countries. If my above analysis is correct, it would have been easier for Meta to comply with GDPR if the US-based Meta company were the data controller."}

{"question":"My question is about promotional contests\/sweepstakes in the United States.Like many, I have received e-mails and hear advertisements directing me to buy something at a store with the promise that I will be entered into some prize drawing (free coffee for life, $1,000, etc.). They always seem to mention that there is no purchase necessary and the contest is only open to people of a certain age. Here is except from a common disclaimer: NO PURCHASE NECESSARY. OPEN TO LEGAL   RESIDENTS OF THE 50 UNITED STATES (D.C.) 18 AND OLDER. ENDS ON . . .  I suspect the no purchase necessary disclaimer is to avoid gambling laws; however, I am not sure and I dont know which law. So, why is there a disclaimer? If its a gambling issue, what is\/are the specific law(s)?","answer":"The reason that clause is in there is because the law does not permit a company from requiring someone to make a purchase in order to participate in a contest.  As such, the company can\/must offer an alternative means of participating to anyone who wishes to.  For instance, they can give you the option to write to a specific address to submit an entry, or perhaps they ask you to complete an online form of some kind.Because winnings are potentially taxable and the prizes themselves may be items which have age restrictions on ownership (cars, for example), contests may be limited to people who are 18 years of age or over.  There are other legal issues pertaining to people under the age of 18 which make such restrictions necessary.Other restrictions (such as geographic limitations) are in place to ensure compliance with applicable law.  For example, certain types of contests may not be lawful in certain states or in foreign countries, so companies take this into account when offering contests.I hope this helps.Good luck!"}

{"question":"Real property seems to have peculiar legal customs.  For example, if somebody has leased property like a vehicle and defaults on their lease the most expeditious way for the true owner to recover the property seems to be repossession, which is essentially physical recovery by 'reasonable' force.But when it comes to a living space the old saying, ',' seems almost literally applicable:  To my knowledge, in the United States at least, there are state and local laws that make it extremely cumbersome for a property owner to evict a tenant in default (and thereby recover the use of their rightful property).

{"question":"If a plaintiff brings a civil suit against another party (aka say the Gorilla glue hair suit), what role does the court play in whether to permit a trial, how has that role changed over the decades, and are there large inconsistencies between federal judicial districts? Federal, as I believe this type of suit would be brought there.I understand and know that a suit can be thrown out, but how far can a court judge a case before trial? And do lawyers pick certain courts where they believe their odds are better?","answer":"American courts generally go through two main stages of pretrial review.First, the parties file their initial pleadings. The plaintiff files a complaint laying out his allegations and identifying the laws violated, and the defendant files an answer saying what allegations are true and which are not. After this happens, the court will entertain either a motion to dismiss or a motion for judgment on the pleadings under , which asks the court to throw out the case because -- even if everything the plaintiff alleges is true -- the defendant still can't be held liable for anything.If the plaintiff makes it past that stage, the court will let the parties move forward with discovery, where the parties exchange evidence, take depositions, etc. Once that process is over, the defendant will typically file a motion for summary judgment under , which asks the court to throw out the case because -- given all the evidence available -- a reasonable jury could not return a verdict for the plaintiff.Broadly speaking, the idea for both of these motions is to ask whether the case presents a question of law or a question of fact. If an employer defendant in an age-discrimination case denies firing the plaintiff, but the plaintiff admits he is only 25 years old, the court can simply end the case because that plaintiff is too young to win an age-discrimination case, as a matter of law. But if the plaintiff is 65 and both parties can point to some evidence supporting their version of what happened, there's a factual dispute that a judge needs to let a jury decide.So as long as there are still important, unresolved factual questions, it is generally going to be set for trial.The precise standards for adjudicating these types of motions have evolved over time, but generally speaking, they have existed for centuries.At this point, there is very little difference among the circuits in how these motions are handled. The standards are laid out in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there has been quite a bit of explicit interpretation by the Supreme Court, and these motions are so routine that every judge is very familiar with the standards."}

Also, perhaps the addresses detectives and police officers aren't searchable in public databases, meaning this is a non-issue?So, what is info can legally be spread about the investigators of an active case?","answer":"If a police officer interrogates you, and you know his identity (name or badge number for example), you can publicize this information. The results of the investigation are, in most (perhaps all) US jurisdictions not yet a public subject to mandatory disclosure, meaning that you can't force the police to reveal the name of an officer leading an investigation, but there is no criminal prohibition against you revealing such facts if you know them.Personal information about police officers is usually not subject to mandatory disclosure under public records law.

{"question":"I'd like to create some original art using images from art history. Let's keep the question widely applicable and say that I might be interested in anything from old paintings and engravings to pen and ink magazine art to early photography, but all of it would be pre-1900s. Many of the images I'm interested in go back much further, all the way to the late 1500s. I live in the United States, but might want to source images from overseas.Presumably the copyright holders for these images are all long expired, and if I've got things right because they predated the copyright law enacted in the early 1900s these images should all be in the public domain.A quick google and a perusal of some art books tells me it isn't that simple. Image archives, whether online or in photo book form, generally appear to make a copyright claim on the images they contain. This makes my want to get a generally more robust idea of what I can and can't do with art historical and early photographic images before I go any further. My question is, what should I know about copyright law and using images that were created prior to the 1900s? What is the best legal practice for reusing images like that in original artwork?","answer":"You don't seem to be distinguishing properly between 'original artwork' and photographs of it. A 19th-century painting will be out of copyright, so you can set up an easel copy it yourself, or even take a photo if the owners don't mind; your copy can be used however you please. However, other people can't use your photograph without your permission. Similarly, if you want to reuse a photograph used in an art book, the important thing is the copyright on the photograph, not the painting."}
{"question":"There are hundreds of videos on YouTube filmed by drivers who refuse to show ID or give information to Border Control agents at interior (non-international border) checkpoints (permanent or arbitrarily) set up along roads, i.e. According to , No documentation is required at a Border Patrol checkpoint for US  citizens...Some of these check stations in YouTube videos are within 100 miles of a border; some are not.The Border Patrol can be very adamant at demanding ID and information.Do these drivers have a solid legal basis - stating that they have been illegally stopped for no reason, that there can be no probable cause solely by driving near a border, that the constitution forbids these kinds of stops - for refusing to show ID?Can they legally refuse to show documents and refuse to answer questions as to where they may be traveling to and from? They don't appear to be getting arrested.Can only US citizens refuse? What about Green card holders?How does the Border Patrol know determine they may or may not be citizens if the individuals are successful at refusing to show ID?","answer":"Away from a border check point a border patrol agent needs 'reasonable suspicion' of a violation of the law (and realistically, a violation of immigration laws) to demand that someone show ID. This is less than probable cause, but more than a suspicionless checkpoint stop or random stop. It doesn't take much, but it takes some articulable reason that sets the person stopped apart from people who are not stopped that does not exclusively constitute racial profiling.Reasonable suspicion cannot arise merely from the refusal to provide ID voluntarily."}

{"question":"In CA, all defeasible fees are known as fees simple subject to a condition subsequent, and all executory interests reserved by the grantor after granting such fees are known as powers of termination.

What is so special about  power of termination? And isn't power of termination unique to CA? Why  would other states not permit it if it has nothing to do with them?This is quite confusing because CA is using non-standard terminology. (This is in part because CA has a mixed civil law and common law legal heritage because most of CA used to be part of Mexico which was a civil law jurisdiction. It continues to have a civil code, but has been heavily influenced since it became a U.S. state in both substance and procedurally and jurisprudential respects by the common law of the U.S. states that were never part of Mexico or France.)What CA calls a 'power of termination' is what most jurisdictions call a 'fee simple subject to condition subsequent'. Other jurisdictions have them, but call them something different. In contrast, a defeasible fee estate that reverts to the grantor upon a condition that takes effect by operation of law rather than at the option of the grantor or someone else, is called a fee simple determinable.Normally, a fee simple subject to an executory limitation includes all defeasible fee estates that upon triggering (either at someone's option, or automatically by operation of law) vest not in the grantor but in a third party. I would also disagree that a fee simple subject to executory limitation (using the standard terminology, rather than CA's oddball terminology - it also has oddball terms like an estate in severalty which means fee simple ownership without co-owners - that are no longer commonly used anywhere else) was not possible to create at common law.The situation is further complicated by the fact that legal defeasible estates in real estate have been abolished by statute in many states, and where they still exist, are so rarely used that the legalities of them have become moribund and are often confused because not enough people are familiar with how they are supposed to work and the proper terminology.Typically, these statutes provide that any deed purporting to create a defeasible estate after the effective date of the statute, will, in fact, create a fee simple estate and the conditions will be null and void. The rule against perpetuities destroys other defeasible estates in those jurisdictions, and eventually, all grandfathered defeasible estates subject to the rule against perpetuities are spent."}
{"question":"I have been offered a job, but while looking over the contract I found a paragraph that concerns me.

I understand MD uses the term exemplary in place of punitive for damages. ","answer":"  Exemplary (punitive) damages vs. recovery of attorneys fees: Is one a  subset of the other?No. Neither one is a subset of the other.

In fact, making one type of damages a subset of the other would unjustifiably discriminate against pro se plaintiffs who, by definition, do not incur attorney fees and yet have been unlawfully harmed in their reputation by statements which are defamatory per se.This  for defamation entitles the plaintiff to actual as well as punitive damages, but it does not mention attorney fees. It is unclear to me whether Maryland legislation addresses attorney fees more generally in a separate statute.By contrast, the Michigan statute , and possibly elsewhere.The difference in legislative detail as enacted in each state does not imply whatsoever that the actual application of defamation law in Michigan is any better or more truthful than in Maryland, though.

{"question":"Why are common people selected to be the jury in the USA?  Shouldn't people that know the law to decide criminal's fate?

Do note that a jury of peers is not a jury of people that share your characteristics (only one gender of the accused's background) but to be a cross-section of the population around.This has been interpreted by courts to mean that the available jurors include a broad spectrum of the population, particularly of race, national origin, and gender.They don't need to know the law, that's what the judge is for.

{"question":"Checking up here on a question that appeared on workplace.stackexchange.com: Someone signed a contract saying 'If you leave the assignment without giving 15 days prior notice you will be liable to pay these days.'. This is in the USA in an at-will employment state, which means the employer can fire the employee at any time without notice, and without these terms the employee could quit at any time without notice. So the question is: In a US state with at-will employment, are contract terms enforceable that say the employee has to pay the employer if they leave without giving notice? (Extra question: Would it be enforceable if the contract just says that the employee has to give 14 days notice, and would it be enforceable if both employer and employee agreed that 14 days notice are required for each side?) Or does the state law that anyone can cancel an employment contract at any time without reason override this?(Probably should have mentioned: In this case the OP posting on workplace had just started a low-paid job, figured out that for medical reasons she couldn't do it, wanted to quit, and then found this term in the contract. So Inaki's answer is very useful in general, while user662852's answer is most helpful in this particular case). ","answer":"  are contract terms enforceable that say the employee has to pay the employer if they leave without giving notice?Yes, as long as the penalization is not of punitive nature. The doctrine of at-will employment is only the default condition, but a contract may supersede it. As for the extra question, reciprocity of sanctions (as in leaving without notice) is not a requirement for enforceability of a contract. In general, the lack of reciprocity only signals that there is a difference in the parties' bargaining power, but usually that does not affect enforceability."}

There are other restrictions, as well, including on which patterns you can use (you can't use any clipart or patterns that depict an individual, for instance).That answer masks a lot of gotchas, though.  For one, you must set limits on the use of the t-shirt image.  Consider this scenario: you do the image, make the t-shirts, and someone buys one.  A third person sees the t-shirt and thinks it would make the perfect costume for a photograph.  Recognizing your copyright in the t-shirt, he asks if he can put a model in your t-shirt and take a picture.  On the language of the license, your answer must be, 'no.'  You do not have the right to sublicense the Corel clipart to the photographer, so you cannot authorize the photograph.  Technically, you will need to be careful about using it in your online t-shirt store for this same reason: if you provide a final (non-downloadable) image for use in the store, you are probably fine.  But if the store permits images to be downloaded and permanently stored, that use is forbidden.The final image to be printed on the t-shirt, the clipart image, your intended and possible future uses of the final design, and much more information about the particular online t-shirt store would all be helpful in giving you a more complete answer.  But the basic answer to the question as posed is, 'No, using an image from Corel clipart incorporated into a t-shirt design and attempting to sell the t-shirt likely would not be a copyright violation on this license.'"}
{"question":"My question pertains to the somewhat recent emergence\/increase of technological searches present at US borders. The premise I am operating under is that, a), while there are limits to this, border agents can demand passwords to phones, laptops or similar devices, and b), you face annoying to potentially serious consequences (being detained, not allowed to enter the US, and\/or having your device confiscated for a period of time or indefinitely). I don't have what I would consider sufficient sources for this information (i.e. for documenting what is actually legal*, certainly there are many sources documenting that such events have occurred).*I am aware that the law in this case may change or become more clearly defined, as matters seem to have a degree of fuzziness now.All of that out of the way, consider somebody (a US citizen) crossing the US border who, knowing they might be stopped and asked for their password by border agents, set an unusually long password. Specifically, one occupying several letter-sized pages. When asked for their password, they provide a pre-printed copy of this password (the rationale is that typing such a password would likely take many attempts and be highly irritating, since you cannot see mistakes on most computer login screens - the individual perhaps intends this to be a protest). What, if any, legal consequences could result from doing this?

Perhaps this person too thinks of this as a protest. What are the potential legal consequences of doing this?I should specify that while I am somewhat flexible with my language by saying 'potential' consequences, an answer merely stating the relevant computer misuse laws for the latter, or failure-to-comply laws for the former isn't exactly what I am looking for - I am interested in an analysis that specifically accounts for the context of these border searches.I have no intention of doing any of these things, nor would I endorse them being done.","answer":"As a citizen, you cannot be denied entry into the US, so you can simply refuse to comply with a demand to unlock your phone, or give them the password. They may (temporarily, some number of weeks) confiscate the device until it is determined to not be a problem (whatever the security issue is). They cannot compel you to unlock it or reveal the password, though a court order could have that result. The consequences of having a 400 character long password are probably similar to the consequences of a refusal, save for the court order part: you can be delayed, and it will cost you something (shipping) to get your device back.  spells out the difference between what you'd hope for and what is.CBP has a : is it almost 10 years old, so things may have changed.

{"question":"I've found the legal definition of duress to be quite well-specified in the case of criminal law, but little of that seems directly applicable to the civil domain. That said, I'm unsure as to if a situation like the following might qualify:Let us suppose Alice and Bob are in a relatively new relationship, but very much in love. However, Alice is unable to work due to a serious, but treatable (although not under government-sponsored healthcare) condition. Bob, on the other hand, has a decent job with excellent insurance coverage, but it extends only to family and spouses (ie, not domestic partners). Under normal circumstance, the two would never consider marriage so early-on, but the combined stress of Alice's condition worsening or the economic pressure of Bob paying for her treatments out-of-pocket has lead the couple to see marriage as the only viable option.If their relationship comes to an end at some point, would they be able to seek annulment under duress instead of facing the legal ramifications of divorce?","answer":"Short Answer: This is Not DuressThis would not constitute duress or a ground for an annulment under U.S. law.In general, economic considerations, or moral duties arising from love and affection, or a felt obligation to do the right thing following a pregnancy, or a need to bring other family members (or oneself) out of dire poverty, do not constitute duress that would constitute a ground for an annulment.Duress would typically have to involve a threat of unlawful physical harm to the person getting married, or to a loved one of a person getting married.Historically Duress Was Not A Ground For An AnnulmentHistorically, duress was not considered a ground for an annulment at all.For example, historically, the duress of a shotgun marriage (literally, a threat to kill the man who got an unmarried woman pregnant if he didn't marry her), would not have been considered a ground for annulment, although it might be today.Similarly, if a king married one of his daughters to the son of another king in exchange for not invading and ruining his country, the daughter could not annul that marriage, even if it was entered into because the two kings agreed that she would be killed if she did not agree and told her so, despite the fact that both she and her father were under duress at the time.Annulments Are Rare And Are Rarely Sought For DuressAnnulment of a facially valid non-common law marriage is very rare.For example, in 2017, there were  and 5 civil union annulment cases, in a year in which Colorado had a population of 5,607,000 people. In the same year it has 25,290 divorce cases, 922 legal separation cases, 6,308 cases seeking an adjudication of parental rights and responsibilities involving unmarried couples, 1,957 paternity cases, 56 civil union dissolution cases, 5 civil union legal separation cases, and 6 cases seeking judicial permission for a minor to marry. There are approximately 41,500 marriages each year in Colorado, so the annulment rate is about 7 per thousand marriages in Colorado, which would be fairly typical nationally. There are about 12 annulments per thousand divorces in Colorado.Duress would be grounds for an annulment in only a tiny share of those rare annulment cases that are filed.In part, in the modern U.S., this is because the wide availability of unilateral no fault divorce, and the abolition of most marital immunities from civil and criminal liability, makes the use of duress to compel someone to marry a pretty futile exercise, that has a high potential for criminal law consequences for someone who attempts to use duress to force someone to get married.Some typical grounds annulments other than duress would involve (in approximate order of frequency)(1) the marriage was entered into under conditions that one or both of the parties felt was a joke or were temporarily too impaired to really understand because they were drunk or under the influence of drugs (legal or otherwise), or(2) an individual who was married didn't have the capacity to appreciate fully what marriage means due to a developmental disability, or due to dementia, or(3) the couple is legally prohibited from marrying (e.g. due to age, because they are a long lost brother and sister, or mother and son, or one or both of the parties was married to someone else at the time), or(4) the marriage was entered into based upon a misunderstanding of one or both parties regarding the sex or gender of the other party (i.e. a woman who thought she was marrying a cisgender man but actually married a transgender man) or the identity of the party (the marriage ceremony was with the wrong twin, for example).Duress would be a less common ground for an annulment than the first three reasons, but might be more common than the fourth reason set forth above.Annulment And The Doctrine Of LachesAlso, annulment is equitable relief that can generally be barred by the doctrine of laches.For example, if two people are married via a facially legal marriage license and aren't legally prohibited from marrying, did so while tripping on LSD and thinking that they were just joking, but then continue to live as husband and wife for eight years and have kids together, a court would probably deny them an annulment, even if an annulment would have been granted if the issue had been raised immediately, even in a state that is not a common law marriage state.Similarly, a marriage entered into at age 13 that was legally recognized due to a lie on a marriage license application, would probably be annulled at age 18 or 20, but laches would probably prohibit an annulment of that marriage at age 40.The put everyone back where they started prior to marriage premise of an annulment is easy to implement when people have been legally married for only a few days or months, especially if they have never actually shared their lives economically and haven't had kids together during the marriage,  but is much harder to implement when they have lived together for a long time as husband and wife.Footnote On Sham Marriages For Immigration PurposesAs an aside, an immigration agency determination that a marriage is a sham that does not afford the immigrant eligibility for citizenship is rarely, if ever, grounds for an annulment under other civil or criminal laws. For example, a sham marriage determination by immigration officials would not end eligibility to file a joint tax return, or end the ability to claim a spousal privilege to exclude a spouse's testimony in a court case, or change the presumption of paternity for children born during the marriage.Canon Law ComparedDuress is ), which aren't considered duress under canon law either.But, a church annulment would have no secular legal effect; it would only affect a person's status in regard to Roman Catholic prohibitions against divorce.Why Seek An Annulment?It is also unclear what you think that the legal ramifications of a divorce as opposed to an annulment would be in this case. The biggest would seem to be that Alice would lose any right to alimony or an equitable property division if this were an annulment rather than a divorce, so generally speaking, an annulment would be harmful to her legally.Historically, annulment was, in part, an extraordinary remedy for cases where divorce was simply not available at all, at least without special legislation authorizing the divorce of a particular man and a particular woman, and in part, a natural outgrowth of the process of a court trying to determine as a factual finding, whether or not two people had gotten married, or had not gotten married. But, in an age where no fault divorce is widely available on an essentially unilateral basis, the need for annulments has largely evaporated."}
{"question":"Let's say someone owns a car and rents it out to a friend. the owner tells the friend \"you can't drive this car unless you put your own car insurance on the car\" and has the friend sign a contract that specifies the same thing.Now 5 months later the friend is driving the car without insurance and gets in an accident which harms someone else and someone else vehicle. Who is responsible for the damages? Would the owner of the car be responsible for anything?This should be hypothetically in the United States and in New York.","answer":"In the United States, car insurance is generally required by law in order to operate a motor vehicle. However, in this scenario, the owner of the car allowed their friend to use the vehicle on the condition that the friend obtained their own insurance coverage.If the friend did not comply with this agreement and drove the car without insurance, they could be held personally liable for any damages or injuries they caused in the accident. This would include any harm caused to other people or their vehicles.The owner of the car, who had required the friend to obtain their own insurance, may not be held directly responsible for the damages. However, it is possible that the injured party or their insurance company could try to hold the owner responsible under a theory of negligence, arguing that the owner should have taken steps to ensure that the friend was actually covered by insurance before allowing them to drive the car.Ultimately, the specific details of the situation and the language of the contract between the owner and the friend would likely play a key role in determining legal liability."}
{"question":"Let's say I'm part of a jury in a case where I believe jury nullification may be warranted, and that my other jurors may agree with me, and so I suggest it to my fellow jurors.  My jurors ask me what would happen if they voted to nullify the verdict and I tell them I can't say for sure, because the legal status of jury nullification is complicated even for the best lawyer, because I'm not a lawyer, and because frankly my knowledge of legal matters is quite haphazard and it's scary to think that the results of a trial and a person's life would depend on my half-remembered understanding of jury nullification.  Unfortunately I can't go online to research jury nullification now that I'm a juror so the jury is stuck with my incomplete knowledge as the best information they have to make a decision with.The other jurors, correctly not trusting me to know what I'm talking about, go to the judge to ask about jury nullification and whether it's an option in this trial.  The judge is one who is not a fan of jury nullification and does not want to see it happen.  Can the judge flat out tell the jury that they cannot vote to nullify the verdict?If the judge did so and the jury chooses to nullify the verdict anyways would the fact that the judge forbade them to do so have any impact on what happens from that point forward?  Would the jury risk repercussions for nullifying a verdict against the judge's orders?Finally is there any situation where a jury trying to nullify a verdict could phrase their objection incorrectly such that the judge could take it as a guilty verdict?  E.g., if they say \"we think you proved the plaintiff did this thing, but we don't believe he should be punished\" can the judge rule that they said he was guilty and just ignore the second half?","answer":"Can the judge flat out tell the jury that they cannot vote to nullify the verdict?He can but this kind of jury nullification makes little sense and is obvious that is not possible. A verdict is rendered by the jury. Once the verdict is rendered, there is no further vote. It would also make little sense for a jury to render a guilty verdict and later have another vote to nullify the previous verdict.From now one I will refer to jury nullification as we usually refer to it: the jury returns a not guilty verdict, although the jury believes the accused is guilty of the crime (rather than returning a guilty verdict and later nullify it, which is what you are implying here)A different question would be can the judge ask the jury to not engage in jury nullification?Yes he\/she can. A judge can respond that jury nullification is not possible. If the jury convicts, this false information by the judge is generally deemed a harmless error on appeal, and the conviction is upheldIf the judge did so and the jury chooses to nullify the verdictanyways would the fact that the judge forbade them to do so have anyimpact on what happens from that point forward?No. Jury nullification is part and parcel of common law, and it could well be part of the jury trial granted by the Constitution.Would the jury risk repercussions for nullifying a verdict against thejudges orders?Only for jury nullification no. They can face repercussions if they lie in voir dire and say that they will follow the law as given to them no matter what, for example.Finally is there any situation where jury trying to nullify a verdictcould phrase their objection incorrectly such that the judge couldrule it as a guilty verdict (ie if they say we think you proved theplaintiff did this thing, but we don't believe he should be punishedcan the judge rule that they said he was guilty and just ignore thesecond half?)Juries return a guilty\/not guilty verdict. They don't return their thoughts to the court (we think that....). They simply say guilty or not guilty.If for some unknown reason they should choose to tell the judge more than what is required from them, jury nullification is still an option of the jury and something that the jury can do, have the right to do, so the judge will not be able to override the jury.But this is something that should not happen. If the jury wants to engage in jury nullification, they have to tell the judge not guilty and nothing more. The jury doesn't have to explain its decision to acquit."}
{"question":"Say there was a record available to all the bars in the state that shows a certified alcohol vendor verified a customer's age with government issued ID. Could that one record of age verification be proof of age for future alcohol purchases?Does state alcohol law dictate vendors must only use government issued IDs and no other proxy ID?","answer":"It doesn't really matter what kind of system verification is in place, unless you personally can see the identification, then you cannot trust another person's word on whether they are of age or not. It's perfectly plausible that another bar didn't actually check and just typed them into their system, or they were buddies and they just typed them in so they could get into their favorite bar. Don't take the chance, ever.Even if such a system as you were talking about scanned in a copy of their ID as part of the verification, there's no saying they didn't actually scan in a fake ID that you might catch by checking it yourself. Bottom line: you're responsible if you sell to a minor and you didn't check their ID yourself. Because if you get busted, the first question they're going to ask is if you saw the actual ID, and if you say no, they're frankly not going to care what other excuses you come up with.As far as what ID you can accept: pretty much all states have slightly differing laws on acceptable pieces of documentation. You'd have to look up what exactly is acceptable in that particular state, but it's not usually hard information to find. But generally all require it to be a government-issued form of ID that has their photo and date of birth listed."}

Or does it refer to something else? In either case, has the interpretation been tested in court?","answer":"The particulars of 'actual knowledge' are addressed in Viacom v. YouTube. The  states (emphasis mine):  Under \u00a7 512(c)(1)(A), knowledge or awareness alone does not disqualify the service provider; rather, the provider that gains knowledge or awareness of infringing activity retains safe-harbor protection if it acts expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material.  17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1)(A)(iii).  Thus, the nature of the removal obligation itself contemplates knowledge or awareness of specific infringing material, because expeditious removal is possible only if the service provider knows with particularity which items to remove...Thus, actual knowledge must be knowledge that is specific enough to allow a service provider to take action against specific infringing content. 'General' knowledge of infringement is not specific enough to be actionable, so it cannot qualify as 'actual knowledge'. (e.g., The general knowledge, 'In the past, about 5% of the videos uploaded to our site were infringing, and we expect that trend continues into the present, so some of our videos right now are probably infringing,' is not actionable to specific videos, so it does not quality as 'actual knowledge'.)That ruling also clarifies the distinction between (i) and (ii), which are respectively termed the 'actual knowledge' provision and 'red flag' provision:  In other words, the actual knowledge provision turns on whether the provider actually or subjectively knew of specific infringement, while the red flag provision turns on whether the provider was subjectively aware of facts that would have made the specific infringement objectively obvious to a reasonable person.Actual knowledge is different from a notification, which the service operator must respond to according to section (c)(1)(C) (whereas your quote is from (c)(1)(A)):  (C) upon notification of claimed infringement as described in paragraph (3), responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.Expeditious removal is required in either event: the operator has actual knowledge of infringement, per (c)(1)(A)(i), or the operator gets a notification, per (c)(1)(C).

{"question":"A lot of states do not permit holographic wills and specifically state in their laws that an unwitnessed will is invalid.This seems like a cruel provision to me. So, if a person writes out in their own handwriting a proper will which is signed and dated, but it is not witnessed, then the state will just throw it out? For a person having no heirs this could be disastrous because instead of the money going to the intended charities and friends, instead the money would just go to the government if the will gets thrown out. Does this actually happen?Also, any answer to this question I would hope will address the legal principle that the law \"favors testacy over intestacy\". In other words, there is a legal principle in common law that it is always better to follow some kind of intent of the deceased, whatever that might be, rather than treat them as completely intestate. This principle would seem to conflict with some state laws that brusquely state that wills that fail to comply with various technical provisions, such as holographic wills, are invalid.","answer":"The page  states in which holographic wills are valid, plus 9 more that will recognize such wills when they are written elsewhere.Beyond that, some states consider a holographic will valid for only a limited time, such as one year, after its date. The idea seems to be that a holographic will is supposed to be for emergency situations, when there is no opportunity to have a will drafted and witnessed in the usual way.Under the common law, holographic wills were valid, if they met a few requirements, such as being entirely in the handwriting of the testator. This satisfied the legal principle that the law favors testacy over intestacy. But such principles never prevail over specific statutes, and the states that disallow holographic wills have generally done so by statute.Holographic wills can be harder to prove, cause court contests, and can perhaps be more subject to fraud, or legislators may have thought so. In any event, they have been made invalid in many jurisdictions.My understanding is that in a state that does not recognize a holographic will, a will not properly witnessed will often be ignored in favor of the legal heirs, that is those who would inherit if there were no will. I am not at all sure about the case where there are no legal heirs, and the state would inherit in the absence of a will. Perhaps there probate judges have more discretion.ExamplesI could not find much caselaw or many news reports about holographic wills, and no case where there were no heirs-at-law, and the alternative was for the estate to go to the state (escheat), although some sites mention the possibility. It seems that few cases dealing with holographic wills are not only brought to court, but appealed so that published opinions on them can be found.The page  (from a law office site) says:A holographic will is a unique type of will that will only be considered valid if it is made under certain extreme conditions. In all other circumstances, a holographic will will not be valid and will not be probated. If this happens, then your estate will be treated as if you died without leaving a will.In New York if you do not leave will your estate will be disposed of according to the laws related to intestate succession. NY EPTL \u00a7 4-1.1. ... If you die leaving only a holographic will and the court determines it to be invalid, then there is a possibility that your property will end up in the hands of New York state. If you are not survived by any relatives, then your property will escheat to the state.The page  says:In one Arizona case, a partially typed and handwritten document was invalidated. A grandmothers wishes were tossed aside, and her granddaughter did not share in her legacy.Ther page  (From a lawyer's blog) says:Holographic wills are invalid in Florida and therefore your assets will pass according to the Florida Intestacy Statute. Your assets located in the State of Florida will pass by the Florida Intestacy Statute even if you validly executed your holographic will in another State that allows holographic wills and then you later move to Florida. ... Finally, if there is nobody that applies, meaning you have no family at all, the property will escheat (transfer) to the State of Florida.The *National Law Reviewe article  says:In In the Estate of Hohmann, the decedent died without leaving an executed will, but his caretaker found a hand written document wherein the decedent stated his wishes for his property. No. 04-20-00237-CV, 2020 Tex. App. LEXIS 9216 (Tex. App.San Antonio November 25, 2020, no pet. history)....The court held that the hand-written document had not been signed and was not valid:Here, we see no evidence in the written instrument indicating that Raymond intended the phrase R. Hohmann Estate to serve as his signature.In the case   Richardson, J. wrote:Where, as here, there is no conflict in the evidence, 'the validity of the holographic instrument must be determined entirely by reference to the applicable statutes and principles of law.' [Citations.] (Estate of Baker (1963) 59 Cal. 2d 680, 683 [31 Cal. Rptr. 33, 381 P.2d 913].) Unanimously in Baker, we stressed that The policy of the law is toward 'a construction favoring validity, in determining whether a will has been executed in conformity with statutory requirements' [citations]. (Ibid.) Moreover, we affirmed 'the tendency of both the courts and the Legislature ... toward greater liberality in accepting a writing as an holographic will. ...' (Ibid.) 'Substantial compliance with the statute, and not absolute precision is all that is required. ...'...In construing section 53 we bear in mind the primary legislative purpose of the holographic will statute which was identified by us in Estate of Dreyfus (1917) 175 Cal. 417, 418-419 [165 P. 941], as the prevention of fraudulent will-making and disposition of property by virtue of the recognized difficulty of forging an entire handwritten instrument....As noted by Professor Osborn: An extended holograph ... is perhaps the most effective means of proving practical execution, even more than witnesses, and the law relating to holograph wills recognizes this fact. ... (Osborn, Questioned Documents (2d ed. 1929) p. 682...Our liberal statutory interpretation and emphasis on substantial compliance expressed in Baker has been well understood, for there have been few reported decisions subsequent thereto which have adopted the hypertechnical application of section 53 to holographic wills which we disapproved in Baker....No sound purpose or policy is served by invalidating a holograph where every statutorily required element of the will is concededly expressed in the testatrix' own handwriting and where her testamentary intent is clearly revealed in the words as she wrote them. Frances Black's sole mistake was her superfluous utilization of a small portion of the language of the preprinted form. Nullification of her carefully expressed testamentary purpose because of such error is unnecessary to preserve the sanctity of the statute. Moreover, rejection of the instrument as a will would have the unfortunate practical consequence of passing her estate through the laws of intestacy to the daughter of her predeceased husband by a former marriage -- in fact, a stranger to her -- thereby excluding those whom she described in the holograph as my very dear friends and my adopted family and the charity which was apparently close to her heart and which she specifically wished to benefit.In the case of  JONES, Justice wrote:It was alleged in said petition that the said writing was not valid in law as a will, because it did not comply with Section 657 of the Mississippi Code of 1942 Annotated (1956) in that it was not subscribed by the said Clara Thompson.  ... The sole question is whether this instrument constitutes a holographic will.No person has an inherent or constitutional right to make a will disposing of his property. Such is a privilege extended to the citizens by the State. 94 C.J.S. Wills \u00a7 3, p. 680 (1956); ... It is a requisite to a valid will that it be executed as prescribed by statute. ...No matter how earnestly one may desire and intend to make a will, a paper, although fully intended by the writer to be a will, is ineffective and invalid unless its execution meets statutory requirements.The purpose of statutes prescribing formalities for the execution of wills is not for the purpose of restricting the power of testator to dispose of his property, but it is to guard against mistakes, impositions, undue influences, fraud, deception, etc., which would divert the property of the testator from those intended by him or her to inherit same. The formalities are for the testator's protection also, as well as the beneficiaries'. ...We have before us here what is claimed to be a holographic will. To be such it must be executed in accordance with the specific requirements of the statute. It must be laid on the table beside the statute to determine whether its execution is in accord therewith. If it is not executed as provided by the statute, it is not a will, regardless of the intention of the alleged testator....An instrument offered as a holographic will must be a complete and executed document, although absolute precision of execution is not necessary, and all that is required is a clear showing on the face of the instrument of its execution in conformity with the law....In summary, the court has construed the statute regarding holographic wills to mean (1) it must be signed at the end of a document, testamentary in character, which shows on its face that the testamentary purpose therein expressed is completed, (2) nothing which follows the signature may be considered, (3) if the writing does not meet the requirements of the statute the intent of the writer is immaterial. The part of the document in question which precedes the signatures thereon fails to show on its face that the testamentary purpose was completed. On the contrary the purported signatures appear in the middle of a sentence....No where is there a court authorized to make a will for any decedent and that is exactly what we would be doing if we said we were going to strike out those words in this instrument which keeps it from being a will.(There was a strong dissent in this case, which I omit.)"}

The communication is encrypted, but I managed to find the encryption key in their app. I know I can't distribute the key, but can I give people instructions on how to find the key?I was planning on making it step-by-step (e.g. 'go to app-downloader.example.com, type in 'com.example.app', download the file, upload it to app-decompiler.example.xyz and look in path\/to\/private.key'), but also wondered itf it was better to scale it back (e.g. 'download the app, decompile it, look in there for the password').I plan to chat to a lawyer when it comes closer to release time, but for now, I'd like to know if I should put the effort in documenting the process or not.EDIT: To further clarify, my app's purpose is to achieve interoperability, or in this case, operability. The app which houses the private key is literally unusable -- I've made 30+ attempts and tried three different phones and their app won't connect to their hardware. Many others are experiencing the same (1.6\/5 stars on Google Play, 16 1-star reviews out of 24 total). Early signs tells me that my code could connect, providing I can encrypt and decrypt the information necessary. Support is non-existent (they stopped replying to comments mid last year, and no updates in that long either).U.S. Code \u00a7 1201 - Circumvention of copyright protection systems tells me that:Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumventionSo as far as I can tell, I'm within my rights to create the code, as my goal is to achieve interoperability, by letting users control this hardware (a Chinese version of a Belkin WeMo WiFi switch) with their home automation system.So my goal isn't to 'stand outside a bank at midnight and offer to give away the access code to the front doors', but rather to stand out the front of a bank during opening hours and show them how to operate the door when they can't get in, and the bank refuses to fix the door.EDIT 2: Since then, I've discovered that I can make this key extraction process even more generic. The app can be freely downloaded from their website. If I download it, read a single file in there and tell my computer to find anything that is 16 alphanumeric characters long in that file (the encryption type they use states that the password MUST be 16 characters long), then it can find it.So now that's what I'm attempting to focus on, because I don't need to distribute anything, I just need to write code to download the file from their public website, pull out all the 16-character long strings from the file (there are a few) and try each key until the correct one is found.","answer":"So it's a confusing conundrum.  In the United States, it's illegal to talk about bomb making for the purposes of committing a criminal act, but it's not illegal to discuss making the same bomb for an academic purpose (discussing the manufacture of a bomb for a terrorist attack you are going to commit is bad.  Discussing how Timothy McVeigh designed his bomb for maximum damage in the Oklahoma City Bombing is good.)   If someone takes knowledge gleaned from the latter situation and uses that knowledge in the former situation than it's probably going to get uncomfortable questions from the investigators, but you are not the bomber, nor was your intent malicious.More to your own concern, I was once considering a course in hacking techniques from a professor I enjoyed (ultimately it was an elective that wasn't scheduled) and he explicitly told the group that when he has taught it he's made it explicitly clear that they were on their own if they actually used any of the techniques taught in the course for an actual computer crime.  This was just advanced demonstration of how to both do this stuff and thus what signs to look for."}
{"question":"If a US federal law creates a private right of action, say for a privacy or consumer protection tort, can the law authorize suit to be brought in a state court, particularly a small-claims court? If so, would specific state legislation to authorize such suits be required? Are there any kinds of cases for which this is currently allowed, or has been in the past?","answer":"The law works in the opposite direction of what you seem to be imagining. State courts generally have jurisdiction to hear lawsuits based on federal law, even without authorization from Congress. It is therefore perfectly normal to see lawsuits under Section 1983 , the Privacy Protection Act, or the Magnuson-Moss Consumer Protection Act being litigated in state court.Instead, when Congress authorizes a private right of action, it includes explicit language when it does not want cases heard in state court. This is the case with  litigation, for example."}
{"question":"I am developing a mobile word game in which the word list and word definitions come from the . According to my research this software is released under the GNU General Public License.I am not using the dictionary's software, only the words and definitions that the software uses, which are originally compiled from other dictionaries (1913 Webster, WordNet, etc). I downloaded the word list separate from the application and copied it to my own formatted file.My research on the license has led to a lot of concern with this:Is this considered using\/distributing the licensed dictionary software?Am I able to sell my mobile game without releasing the source code to the public?If I sell my mobile game, are purchasers able to redistribute my software freely since the dictionary is under a free license?I want to avoid any future problems with this, so any suggestions are appreciated.","answer":"The GCIDE dictionary itself is licensed under GPL-3.0. It consists of a bunch of files with markup, no software involved. Indeed, the GPL can also be applied to non-software works, though it is unusual.When you use material under some license, you must comply with the terms of the license. In case of the GPL, there are two highly relevant conditions:Everyone who receives a copy of the covered work (original or modified, in whole or in part) must receive the complete corresponding source code of the work, under the terms of the GPL-3.0.If you create a derivative work of the covered work, the derivative work can only be distributed under the GPL-3.0.However, selling the covered material is perfectly fine. The GPL does not forbid you to make money, however you must not profit from your requirement to provide the corresponding source code.Here, the core question is whether your mobile game would be a derivative work of the GPL-licensed dictionary. If your game merely loads the dictionary as a data file, I don't think they would form a single derived work. However, if you compile the dictionary into your app, this would be more difficult to argue.Ultimately, what is a derivative work will depend on a court. It could therefore be helpful to keep your app as clearly non-derivative as possible. I would avoid baking the dictionary into the app's binary but store it separately as a data file, would show attribution notices in reasonable places (e.g. a screen with attribution notices and the complete license text), and would make it possible for users to export a copy of the dictionary files. Furthermore, the GPL-3.0 may require you to allow users to modify this file, for example by making it possible to import a modified dictionary into your app."}

{"question":"To install software, you virtually always have to have a license to do so, which states the conditions that you must observe in order to have permission to install the software. Sometimes an institution obtains a license from the rights-holder which allows them to distribute copies in a specified way, subject to a set of conditions on X imposed on the end user. (I believe this is what 'sub-licensing' refers to).The institution may err in its statement of the sub-license terms, for instance omitting a specification 'non-commercial use only'. In that case, the end user is misled as to what their actual legal relationship to the rights holder is: they have not been told that the software may not be used commercially, but permission was contingent on that restriction. The user also has no way to know what the license agreement is between the rights holder and the institution (except if the terms of that agreement are published). Using the software for a commercial purpose is thus not permitted, and the user has infringed on copyright.Although the user is innocent, they still did the act. As far as I know, the copyright statutes do not require any particular mental state for liability so there is no innocent infringement defense.  does allow mitigation of statutory damages:In a case where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the  court finds, that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to  believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright,  the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages  to a sum of not less than $200.The user might then sue the institution to recover that amount.However, a lot of law is written by the courts. So my questions are (1) is it correct that there is no statutory provision that makes such a user non-liable and (2) is there any case law that nevertheless makes an innocent infringement defense possible? Mainly I am asking about US law, but facts from other jurisdictions are also welcome.","answer":"Innocent' infringement is still infringement and is punishable as intentional infringement or 'at the court's discretion' with a nominal $200 fine.In the circumstances the court will almost certainly exercise their discretion and reduce the damages to $200."}
{"question":"ContextThere are several companies in the US offering package and mail forwarding services to people located in other countries.These services are useful for purchasing in the US to merchants that refuse sending abroad, or when the cost for shipping abroad is prohibitive.How it works by package & mail forwarding agents in the USIn the US, mail forwarding agents typically require you filling a  that allows USPS delivering at the Mail Through Agent.Below some shipping volume, it seems that this form doesn't always have to be notarized.

Hence, I'm wondering about the legal implications of this.The US mail forwarding agents emphasize the benefit of getting a US mailing address, but I couldn't find a single word about the legal risks, especially for individual business or small companies.Could one wrongly assume that you are residing in the US, or eventhat you are illegally doing business there?When shopping in the US, before forwarding abroad, can there be import taxes between two US states? (I assume no because the states are \"United\" but prefer being certain of that.)If shopping exclusively in the US and forwarding to my country, are there other possible taxes that the forwarding agent should take care on my behalf (apart from the customs declaration that I could fill remotely on the agent's platform)?Other possible risk that I omitted and that should be mentioned?Comparison with package & mail forwarding agents from other countriesIn other countries, some mail agents are using a more conservative approach.When opening an account, you have to set your account type depending on the purpose (e.g. \"forwarding purchases to myself\" or \"sending to customers\").

But I wouldn't call that a legal risk. If you are wrongly classified and it has consequences, you can clear up the misunderstanding. You can't be deported from a place where you are not present, so the immigration law risk is minor.When shopping in the US, before forwarding abroad, can there be importtaxes between two US states? (I assume no because the states areUnited but prefer being certain of that.)There are no analogs to customs laws between U.S. states that apply in this situation. States are allowed under the U.S. Constitution to have customs duties so long as they don't exceed the costs of inspecting goods in interstate commerce and states utilize this in long haul trucking but not in consumer scale activities.The U.S. and governments in the U.S. are constitutionally forbidden from imposing customs duties on exports.If shopping exclusively in the US and forwarding to my country, arethere other possible taxes that the forwarding agent should take careon my behalf (apart from the customs declaration that I could fillremotely on the agent's platform)?States and local governments can impose sales and use taxes on retail sales of goods delivered to their state and often do. This address could subject you to the sales and use taxes of the state where goods that are forwarded are delivered.Other possible risk that I omitted and that should be mentioned?You might be investigated for using the forwarding service to ship contraband, and there could be complications for goods that due to intellectual property licensing restrictions are only supposed to be marketed to markets that don't include the final destination of your goods.If you order a high volume of high value, low weight, marketable goods or commodities (e.g. gold and loose gemstones), you may also be suspected of money laundering."}

Facebook showed that the document had been accessed by the account user and the court accepted that as the person who owned the account and the person summonsed were the same that service had occurred.In general, it doesn't matter how a document was served so long as there is evidence that it was received: email and other forms of electronic messaging may or may not provide such evidence. For example, if an email is part of a conversation then each response provides evidence that the previous email was received - the only room for doubt is in the last email in the chain.An exception to this is the  where something that is mailed is deemed to be received when it is dropped in the mailbox or, for some legislation, 'in the ordinary time for delivery', usually 1 or 2 days."}
{"question":"If I sell crypto, can I purchase new crypto and avoid paying capital gains tax on it?Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Section 1031 now applies only to exchanges of real property and not to exchanges of personal or intangible property. An exchange of real property held primarily for sale still does not qualify as a like-kind exchange. A transition rule in the new law provides that Section 1031 applies to a qualifying exchange of personal or intangible property if the taxpayer disposed of the exchanged property on or before December 31, 2017, or received replacement property on or before that date.Moreover, from  the amendment says:2017-Pub. L. 11597, \u00a713303(b)(5), substituted \"real property\" for \"property\" in section catchline.Subsec. (a)(1). Pub.

{"question":"How is probation handled when the offender commits a crime in one state, but lives in another?For example - a DUI usually does not involve a jail\/prison sentence, but probation.  While on vacation in Oregon someone gets a DUI.  He lives in California.In what state will the trial be?  Could the trial be moved to California?If he's convicted, will he have to move to Oregon to serve probation or would he automatically serve probation in California since he lives there?Please change crime and states as necessary.","answer":"While on vacation in Oregon someone gets a DUI. He lives inCalifornia.In what state will the trial be?Oregon. State law crimes are always tried in the jurisdiction where they are committed. A crime is committed either where the acts causing the crime took place or where the harm caused by the crime is directed. In the classic example, if you shoot and murder someone in Oregon from within California, either state (or both states) can prosecute you for murder. If you have a DUI in Oregon that doesn't involve crossing the state line, California can't try you for that crime.If he's convicted, will he have to move to Oregon to serve probationor would he automatically serve probation in California since he livesthere?A standard condition of probation is to not leave the state without court permission, but the court imposing probation can authorize you to leave the state subject to other restrictions devised by the court (e.g. forfeiture of one's passport until the probation sentence is completed so that extradition is available if a felony is committed while on probation).There is also a process in place by which states can cooperate to have their probation officers supervise a convicted defendant's probation order from one state in another state (usually with the requirement that the sentencing state either pay for that service, have the defendant pay for that service, or that there be reciprocity such that California will only agree supervise people placed on probation in Oregon if Oregon will agree to supervise people placed on probation in California).It is also possible that even though probation is an available sentencing option, that for an out of state defendant, a jail sentence and\/or a larger than usual fine will be imposed in lieu of a probation sentence, to avoid these complications.Of course, unless you let your lawyer (or if you are representing yourself, the court) know what you would like to arrange and take the proper legal steps to do so (which realistically requires the skills of an experienced criminal lawyer), the court won't allow you to do so."}
{"question":"The US Constitution now has . I noticed that these amendments are \"attachments\" to the original US Constitution. Why don't the constitutional amendments directly modify the text of the original US Constitution? This seems to be different from how other laws are modified, where bills propose to modify the text of existing laws. Is there a legal or historical reason for this?","answer":"The best explanation is tradition, followed by Congress does not actually rewrite laws (it passes laws whose effect changes what counts as the law). Traditionally, Congress would enact some law, then it could later enact a law which effectively modifies existing laws. That modification could be implicit, by stating a new legal fact, which corrects some earlier legal fact. For instance, the  enacted a law (session I, p. 4: Ch. III in second volume) entitled An Act supplementary to the act, intituled 'An Act to provide for the valuation of Lands and Dwelling Houses, and the enumeration of slaves, within the United States', which was enacted by the 5th Congress Ch. LXIX, p. 580. The amendment added a power to the commissioners created by the first act to revise, adjust and vary valuations. This is done by simply stating a new power, and does not require re-writing the entire earlier text  it was understood that the new act overrides the old act.Contemporary statutory practice (as opposed to constitutional practice) is that congressional acts which revise older laws will state, in some fashion, how the previous law should be edited. Officially speaking, the law is the historical sequence of acts of Congress and therefore Congress does not actually rewrite laws (except on some occasions where it does).An example of an editing instruction enacted by Congress is an amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act which states that(n) IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT. (1) Section 411(b) of theImmigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1521(b)) is amended bystriking and under the general policy guidance of the United StatesCoordinator for Refugee Affairs (hereinafter in this chapter referredto as the 'Coordinator') and inserting the Secretary of State.It is very difficult to keep track of the hundred of thousands of acts of Congress making up the Statutes at Large, therefore we also have the US Code system which effectuates the various historical changes. For the most part, the codified (re-written) laws accurately reflect the complex sequence of statutes passed by Congress. though there was a whoops-moment whenThe Act of Sept. 7, 1916, 39 Stat. 753  in 1993).Given how few and how autonomous the amendments to the US Constitution have been, there is no compelling need to adopt a wholesale rewrite model of amendments for the Constitution, though the election of POTUS is one area where it might make sense to delete previous text (still, it's not difficult to read the whole document, as opposed to reading the entirety of the Statutes at Large).A wholesale rewriting of the US Constitution is possible, and . This is still a possibility, but not one which gains sufficient popular support. Until there is a sufficiently large call for an actual rewriting of the US Constitution, we will followed this particular method of amending the Constitution."}

However, they could be uses in states that had been in rebellion.You cant unless you can.This is specifically about rights guaranteed in the ConstitutionIn this particular case, the right of habeas corpus.There is no equivalent right applicable to face masks so a law mandating them in certain circumstances does no more infringe a Constitutional right than mandating the wearing of clothes in public.You cant unless you can.Breaking the law doesnt cause you to lose your jobThe second quote, the origin of which is unknown and definitely not in the case, is total fantasy.Even if a law against face masks was unconstitutional, the authors of that law have overreached and the remedy is to go to a court to have it declared unconstitutional.

The package (allegedly) contains Last Will and Testament which must remained sealed. This is so when the recipients receive it, everyone can see it be opened for the first time and be sure of it.Question: is this true? In law, how common is it for legal documents (such as a Last Will and Testament) to be sealed and become invalid if they are opened? How does this work? The destination is in the US. Also if they are forged documents could I be held liable to the crime?","answer":"In order for a will to be probated (acted on legally), a certified copy must be filed with the local probate court. Suppose the will is in a sealed envelope: you take it to the courthouse, and the clerk will have you open it, because they don't just take random sealed envelopes  the probate judge will read it. There is no official opening ceremony. It's an interesting question how the court would deal with a will that states e.g. 'this will is valid only if it remains sealed in this envelope with such-and-such security seal', but if there were no competing wills, that clause would probably be ignored. The point is that in order to be acted on legally, the will has to be opened.If the will is in a package containing, e.g. heroin, the aforementioned issue would arise in that the package must be opened in order to get at the will, with the added complication that if you open the package in the presence of the clerk, there's a fair chance that you will be arrested for possession of heroin.

Ga 1982) as saying:  The citizens are the authors of the law, and therefore its owners, regardless of who actually drafts the provisions, because the law derives its authority from the consent of the public, expressed through the democratic process.It also quotes  as saying:  As a matter of longstanding public policy, the U.S. Copyright Office will not register a government edict that has been issued by any state, local, or territorial government, including legislative enactments, judicial decisions, administrative rulings, public ordinances, or similar types of official legal materials. Likewise, the Office will not register a government edict issued by any foreign government or any translation prepared by a government employee acting within the course of his or her official duties.  However, some states do attempt to claim copyright in electronic versions of their state codes. The 2015 LA Times story  reports on a recent infringement suit by the State of Georgia against Carl Malamud, who makes copies of the Georgia Annotated Code available for free online. The state claimed that the annotations are protected by copyright.In  a three-judge panel of the US 11th Circuit Court of Appeals found this claim to be without merit.   After a thorough review of the law, and an examination of the annotations, we conclude that no valid copyright interest can be asserted in any part of the OCGA....  In most states the official code is comprised of statutory text alone, and all agree that a states codification cannot be copyrighted because the authorship is ultimately attributable to the People....  When a legislature enacts a law, or a court writes an opinion rendering an official interpretation of the law in a case or controversy, they are undisputedly speaking on behalf of the People, who are properly regarded as the author of the work....  Because we conclude that no copyright can be held in the annotations, we have no occasion to address the parties other arguments regarding originality and fair use. <h3>Non-US Laws<\/h3>UK laws are protected under Crown Copyright, although permissive licenses for reproducing copies are easily available. Many other countries have similar provisions. The US, however, does not generally recognize such copyrights.The  of the US Copyright Office is that:  [T]he Office will not register a government edict issued by any foreign government or any translation prepared by a government employee acting within the course of his or her official duties. <h3>Laws Incorporating Copyrighted Works by Reference<\/h3>Laws sometimes include by reference privately developed and copyrighted documents. For example, building codes and other safety codes may be developed by private groups, often national non-profit organizations, and incorporated into state laws by reference. This means that the text of the privately developed code is legally part of the law, and the law cannot be fully understood and complied with without reading the code. But the code is a copyrighted work, and the copyright holder may charge for copies.For example,  says:   The Texas statutes, administrative rules, and local ordinances occasionally adopt, incorporate, or refer to technical codes published by independent organizations. These codes describe scientific and safety standards for structures and discuss specifications for fire safety, electrical systems, plumbing fixtures, construction practices, and many other topics....  Codes are not reprinted within the statutes or the local ordinances themselves. They are 'adopted by reference' or 'incorporated by reference' and are usually available to review at the city clerk's office and at some public libraries. Please contact your local public library or your local government for assistance accessing codes not available online.<h3>Federal Copyrights<\/h3>However, this does not mean that anything 'published by the US government' is in the public domain or is free of copyright. The Federal government often hires contractors to prepare various works. These works are protected by copyright. Frequently, the contracts will assign this copyright to the Federal government, which as 17 USC 105 says:  ... is not precluded from receiving and holding copyrights transferred to it by assignment, bequest, or otherwise.Such works are therefore copyrighted, and the copyright holder is or may be the US Federal Government. They are protected in the same way and to the same degree as works of private authorship. Many works funded by the US Federal Government fall into this category."}

By binding, I mean of similar strength of common Double jeopardy rules. That way, if later I get sued I can show a previous court ruling stating that what I am doing is fine.","answer":"Processes vary greatly from country to country on this matter.In the U.S., most courts (including the federal courts) cannot issue advisory opinions that are binding, subject to some narrow exceptions in fact patterns different from those you are envisioning.But, if there is a bona fide dispute involving an actual case or controversy between two or more well defined parties, it is sometimes possible to get a declaratory judgment from a court regarding what a law means, or the meaning of contract.For example, if you are in a position where you have no choice but to administer a law one way or the other in a particular upcoming case, you can usually ask a court for guidance.Also, some administrative agencies can enter into binding agreements with citizens regarding how it will treat a particular activity (the comments give the example that is typical of the IRS issuing a private letter ruling to a taxpayer) in advance.Sometimes an agency charged with enforcing a law (e.g. a prosecutor's office) can likewise make a binding interpretation of the law that people to whom the binding interpretation of it are legally entitled to rely upon.Furthermore, even when these options are not available, something called an opinion letter from an attorney in the U.S., while not binding courts in later litigation, can mitigate the harm suffered from breaking the law because you will usually be found to have acted in good faith in interpreting the law even if you are wrong, and may shift some of the exposure to monetary harm from a misinterpretation of the law to the author of the opinion letter if you are a person whose reliance on the opinion letter is expressly intended by the author of the opinion letter."}
{"question":"(sorry about the camelCaseTitle, I ran out of characters)Have there been any lawsuits where the losing party is known to have intentionally lost, because they wanted the opposite precedent of what would benefit them in that particular case? For example, suppose XYZ Entertainment Inc. publishes a movie, then ABC Studios LLC uses part of it in their own movie in a way that is possibly fair use. XYZ then sues ABC. If ABC won, however, the precedent would do them more harm than good long-term; they don't want other companies to be able to copy their work in that way, and they are willing to pay damages to XYZ to avoid that. In the scenario described in my question, ABC would try to lose the lawsuit, because the damages they will pay by losing are less than the long-term loss they would suffer due to the precedent set by them winning. Has something like this ever happened?

{"question":"As many have adviced here:  ,but no one did so far, I'll ask it over here, as I'm curious aswell:All I read is 'Co-signing is the same level of risk, as giving the loan from your own money.' But if it is my own money and I lent the money, I could sue the person if they would not pay as it was negotiated.Is this given for co-signing aswell?Can I sue someone for the financial damage I took due to co-signing their loan?Or does this depend on the circumstances making him not able to pay(in which case I would consider this even worse compared to giving the loan by yourself)?@the comment, notifying me that I can sue anyone for anything: I was assuming it is implying that I'm asking about this beeing appropiate in respect of law. Not that I'm asking about beeing physically able to file it.If this is widely location dependent, assume it to be as tagged, but a common answer is prefered if possible.","answer":"From a legal perspective co-signing a loan isn't the same thing loaning the money to the other co-signer. When you co-sign a loan with someone else both you and the other person are equal parties in the loan, both jointly responsible in fully paying off the principle and interest. If loan is defaulted on, the bank can pursue legal remedies to try to recover its money against either or both of you.If you end up having to pay part or all of the loan, then whether or not you can recover any of that money will depend on whatever agreement you made with the other person. Given that you probably wouldn't a have a signed written agreement with the other signer in case like this, it'll probably come down to whether or not you can prove (on the balance of probabilities) that the other party promised to you to pay off the full amount of the loan. It will help if the loan is specifically tied to a car, a house or other property that the other party benefits from but you don't. Note that you'd have to give serious consideration to whether the other party can actually pay the amount owed. There's no point going to court to obtain an unenforceable judgement.I also should say that from a financial perspective it does make some sense to think of it as if you were loaning out the money yourself. While there's a big and significant difference between the two, in that your bank account isn't affected unless the other person defaults, if they do the result is going to be pretty much the same. Indeed in that case it's not much different than just giving the other person the money. When co-signing a loan you really need to trust that other person."}

The store's conduct would not be found in violation of Oregon's Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA). See .(I am not verifying the multitude of cross-references in the UTPA, but the language of explicit items gives a general idea of what types of conduct the statute sanctions)The store's decision to decline orders, preorders or money for the product impliedly alerts customers not to grow premature expectations on acquiring the product. Also the store's disclaimer of out of stock weakens a customer's possible allegation that customer relied on a promise of availability of the product. Accordingly, the store prevents a customer from credibly arguing that he incurred losses as a result of the store's conduct.Does it matter if (Product) was available in other stores or just never produced at all? Does it matter if other stores have (Product) but charge more than $N?No. The fact that the store [unsuccessfully] attempted to get stock indicates that the shortage --and hence the failure to supply the product-- is not willful. This implies that the matter is not actionable even if the customer suffered an ascertainable loss of money or property. See ORS 646.605(10) and .638.That being said, it is noteworthy 646.683(8)(a) lowers the requirement of willfulness [of violation] to one of recklessness in the context of class actions."}
{"question":"Every time I register a copyright with the US Copyright Office, they eventually send me a fancy \"Certificate of Registration\" printed on heavy, patterned stock. I scan it and then file it away in a box.I have a lot of these certificates, and they take up substantial room in my small office. I've never had cause to use one in any way. When I've had to prove ownership I've always relied on either scans of the certificate or just going directly to the copyright office website.Is there any realistic situation where a court decision might hinge on producing the original physical paper certificate? Or are they just souvenirs that I can safely shred?","answer":"Short AnswerIs there any realistic situation where a court decision might hinge onproducing the original physical paper certificate?Yes. But there are alternative options to prove the same thing, even then.A copyright registration certificate is not like a dollar bill or an original promissory note, where a copy isn't as good as the original, even though it can be slightly convenient to have the original in hand.Or are they just souvenirs that I can safely shred?If you scan them and then shred them, nothing horrible will happen. In the rare worst case scenario where the fact of your registration is disputed by a stubborn defendant in a copyright infringement lawsuit all of the way up to trial, you could get a replacement certified copy from the Copyright Registrar, or you could prove your registration with other evidence.Long AnswerRegistration is not required for a copyright to come into being in U.S. law. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102(a) and 408(a). But it is a condition precedent (i.e. a requirement that must be met prior to taking action) to certain legal remedies. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 412. So, proving your registration is usually one element of your infringement claim in a typical copyright infringement lawsuit.In that lawsuit, if you actually go to trial, you need to prove that the copyright was registered in a timely fashion, if the other side won't stipulate to that fact.But it would be rare for a defendant who had been presented with a copy to insist that the fact of registration be proven at trial because being that stubborn is likely to piss off the judge unless they can successfully prove that you have faked your claim to have a registered copyright, which is something that almost no intelligent lawyer in a copyright infringement lawsuit wants to do, since judges have broad discretion on so many issues, even in a jury trial.The easiest way to prove the fact that your copyright was registered on a particular date is to offer up a certified government document like the ones that you have in your office into evidence as an exhibit (typically, one of your very first exhibits in your infringement case). This is because an official government certificate is exempt from the hearsay rule, is self-authenticating ,and its contents are admissible if not barred by another rule of evidence (which it almost never would be). The legal reason for keeping these paper documents is to get that evidentiary benefit at trial. See Federal Rules of Evidence  (admissibility of public records).Of course, mostly, these fancy certificates are issued as a matter of pride and ego and customer satisfaction. Prior to an actual trial or evidentiary hearing in a copyright infringement lawsuit, a copy, supported by your declaration under penalty of perjury that the copy isn't a fake, would be the usual way to establish your registration in documents that are e-filed through the federal electronic e-filing service called CM\/ECF rather than presented in person on paper anyway.Typically, pretrial document disclosure is done via an electronic transmission of scanned copies as well.In practice, it would be quite rare for a defendant in a copyright infringement lawsuit to insist that you prove up your registration at trial, rather than just stipulating to it. Indeed, it is you who might not want to stipulate in a jury trial, just so you can flash an important looking document in front of the jurors right at the start of the trial for dramatic effect. But you don't have to do that.Ultimately, if the defendant really did insist on proof of your registration, you could get a new certified copy from the Copyright Registrar (which wouldn't be quite as pretty, but would have the same legal effect) for a small fee without too much advanced notice, or you could introduce your scanned copy into evidence and authenticate it through, for example, your testimony on the stand under oath that you scanned the original and that it is a true and correct copy of the original.You also might want to keep a paper copy because it will still be around if all of the relevant electronic records are destroyed or inaccessible for some reason. But if that happens, copyright infringement may be the least of your worries."}
{"question":"It seems that there was a large increase in civil awards around 1980. Piper Aircraft went bankrupt in 1991 after a decade of fighting lawsuits. In 1975, there were 20 makers of football helmets. By the 1990s, there were only 2 left, the others all exiting the business due to lawsuit liability. The manufacture of small planes came to a complete halt in the United States. What changed? Obviously in the 1950s and 1960s these companies had no problem operating. What changed in the 1980s with regard to civil lawsuits that caused these large increases in awards?BackgroundThe immediate reason for the change is obvious: in  (1962) the California Supreme Court decided that manufacturers would be held strictly liable for any 'defects' in products. Since juries tended to ignore whether defects actually existed, all that really mattered was the strictly liable part and lawsuits against manufactured goods skyrocketed. At the same time, the Act of God defense, which previously had been used to routinely dismiss lawsuits against manufacturers, was essentially discarded by the courts and no longer allowed. These changes were subsequently added to state laws across the country, essentially making product manufacturers suable. This is called the 'Section 402 Revolution' in legal history.Note that these changes were part of a trend, not a single event. For example before 1920 manufacturers were mostly legally immune to lawsuits (see Schwartz). Then the courts changed this and allowed lawsuits if the manufacturer was 'negligent'. Finally, in the 1960s this changed again, and manufacturers were held 'strictly liable' and negligence was no longer necessary to be proven. So, there was a definite trend. The question is what caused this trend?","answer":"The Liability Insurance CrisisThere was absolutely an increase in liability insurance premiums in the 1980s, although the cause of the  in the 1980s remains disputed.  During the period from 1984 to 1987, premiums for general liability  increased from about $6.5 billion to approximately $19.5 billion.  In addition to increases in premium, many insurers took the following  measures to limit the number and cost of claims: 1) changed policy  coverage from an occurrence to a claims-made basis; 2) expanded  exclusions; 3) raised deductibles; and 4) lowered policy limits on a  per-claim basis, and 5) introduced the notion of aggregate total  exposure.    The resulting crisis adversely affected a diverse range of  organizations, including municipalities, social service providers and  pharmaceutical, aircraft, sports equipment, and medical device  companies. Many organizations in the nonprofit and government sector  could no longer offer social, medical or recreational services due to  the prohibitive cost or unavailability of liability coverage.CausesAccording to the same Wikipedia source linked above, some of the leading explanations for the liability insurance crisis include:  Collusion: the argument that the crisis was engineered by insurance  companies themselves, through price-fixing and\/or manipulation of  insurance reserve accounts.    Losses: Decrease in interest rates and investment returns forced  insurance companies to raise premiums in order to make up for the loss  of profitability.    Litigation: Proliferation of tort litigation and large settlements  drove the cost of liability insurance premiums to excessive levels.    Reinsurance: Disruption of supply in reinsurance markets cited as a  contributing factor.There are also a couple of distinct questions of causation. One is why liability insurance premiums needed to rise, and another is why this happened all at once. In all likelihood, the pressures on the industry accumulated over many years, and merely exploded all at once due to a crack in competitive pressure to keep rates low, and quite possibly due to major tax law changes around that time that may have disrupted the status quo.Much of the  concerning tort liability were established in the 1990s, in the wake of the liability insurance crisis of the 1980s, so there isn't great retrospective data.Developments In Civil Procedure And Tort LawThe major contemporaneous revolution in civil procedure was largely a pro-defendant, rather than a pro-plaintiff one. In a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions including Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,  (1986), the U.S. Supreme Court made it much easier for defendants in civil cases to avoid trials by jury by having cases dismissed by judges prior to trial pursuant to a Motion for Summary Judgment, which had previously been granted much more sparingly.Likewise, there was not really any revolution in class action procedure which had existed with only modest amendments . These was a major amendment of the class action rules in 1966, but it didn't really dramatically change the scope of the rule.There was a significant expansion of tort liability for defective products that  and gradually spread across the nation.During the 1970s there were a variety of laws passed on subjects such as consumer protection, tenant rights, environmental protection, workplace safety regulation, and intellectual property that generally speaking expanded the scope of civil liability.Underlying Changes In Scientific Knowledge And The EconomyAnother important factor was a rise in scientific knowledge and contemporaneous changes in the economy.Private sector economic production came to a near standstill from the stock market crash of 1929 that began the Great Depression until the end of World War II in 1945, it took time for the economy to return to normal after World War II, and the Korean War again put the economy on something of a wartime footing in the 1950s.While automobiles had been around since before World War I, public transit was much more robust until the post-World War II economic recovery and interstate highway system made automobile ownership (which was one of the areas where product liability laws were first expanded) much more common. Another industry which rapidly surged in this time period was general aviation. The economic prosperity of the 1960 to 1980s (driven in significant part by rampant labor unrest and perennial strikes from the end of World War II into the 1960s, assisted by labor shortages and pent up demand for consumer goods at home and abroad where industry had been wiped out by World War II), and the growing scope of manufacturing enterprises, meant that in general, people were buying more durable goods made by fewer companies. People who don't buy much and buy very simple, locally produced goods are rarely injured by the products they buy.Many new pharmaceuticals and chemical products (think 'The Graduate' and 'Plastics') were being invented, but without the careful regulatory trials before they were introduced. This caused a great deal of harm when the new chemical products had unintended toxic side effects.New technologies often have unintended side effects and insufficient attention to safety (dams that would fail, industrial revolution factories, myriad litigation in the wake of the introduction of the railroad), but a lot of that had been forgotten after decades of technological and economic stagnation in the private sector.In the 1920s, a particular product might be made by hundreds of manufacturers, mostly fairly local, each with their own particular defects. By the 1970s, just a handful of companies in the nation would make a particular product, so if it was defective, one particular defect would harm far more people.New government agencies like the National Transportation Safety Board (1967), the Environmental Protection Agency (1970), the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (1971), the Consumer Products Safety Commission (1972), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (1975), the Mining Health and Safety Administration (1977) and so on, began compiling that kind of data that made it possible to identify safety risks with common causes on a national scale that made it possible to prove that individual injuries were caused common defects traceable to large national companies or industries. Municipalities started to take building code enforcement more seriously and scientifically after decades in which this was irrelevant because nobody was building anything.These agencies and judicially created tort doctrines expanding liability were driven by increasing faith in science and technology. Also, an increasingly prosperous and better educated population was more able to worry about health and safety now that its more urgent priorities like securing food and shelter had been addressed satisfactorily, and it understood how the modern economy worked better than it had in the past.For example, at Love Canal, in Western New York, toxic pollution had been accumulating for decades (since well before the 1940s), but average citizens only started to understand that it was putting them at risk in the 1960s, and the true extent of the environmental disaster was not recognized until a New York State agency organized a large scale scientific investigation in 1977 using newly developed forensic chemistry techniques to quantify the extent to which people were exposed to toxic chemicals. Until then, many people suspected that pollution wasn't good, but nobody had the capacity to link pollution to negative health outcomes in individuals and communities.Litigation and one of the nation's first Superfund sites followed in the early 1980s. The incredibly complex litigation that followed was still going strong at my first job after I graduated from law school in 1995 when I worked on the Love Canal case as a lawyer, representing some of the insurance companies on that risk.The Rise of Big LawAnother innovation that changed how the legal system worked was the rise of the large law firm. When Abraham Lincoln was practicing law, the biggest law firm in the United States probably had no more than twenty lawyers. Law firms with as many as 50 lawyers were extremely rare into the 1950s. Large law firms bloomed everywhere as economies of scale caused their clients to consolidate into large national and multinational companies in need of lawyers with a wide variety of regulatory and technical legal specialties.These law firms were a reaction to the rise in Plaintiff's law firms retooled to gather the technical information and expertise (often gathered by government agencies and burgeoning universities fueled by GI Bill enrollment) that was needed to prosecute product liability cases and mass torts and to manage massive amounts of discovery and class action lawsuit in this complex litigation. ConclusionI don't think that there is one neat consensus answer that even a very informed analysis can provide for the liability insurance crisis. And, like most great moments in economic and social history, there were almost certainly multiple significant causes that all converged at once. But, this answer, at least, touches on some of the relevant considerations."}
{"question":"A 2 lane road is enhanced, widened and expanded to 6 lanes. it goes through a small town. The previous speed limit on that road was 55 mph.After the new road is finished the speed limit signs are taken down in preparation for the new speed study.The police in this small town contend that the old speed limit of 55 mph is still in force. The say that because of the ordinance of that town is still on the books, they can still enforce it even though no speed limit signs are posted on the road.The road is a named and numbered state highway.According to Texas law, I see that it states this:(b) Unless a special hazard exists that requires a slower speed for compliance with Section 545.351(b) , the following speeds are lawful:(1) 30 miles per hour in an urban district on a street other than an alley and 15 miles per hour in an alley;(2) except as provided by Subdivision (4), 70 miles per hour on a highway numbered by this state or the United States outside an urban district, including a farm-to-market or ranch-to-market road;That road is a farm-to-market road.This road is also one where there are not many driveways and would be considered to be outside of an urban district.So what would the speed limit be on that road when there are no posted speed limit signs anywhere in that city on that road?In Texas speeding is considered to be a class C misdemeanor criminal offense and is not a civil infraction. In Texas a trial by jury can be had for those offenses.","answer":"It would be the speed limit that a  would assume.Such a person would see speed limit signs on the highway before it approaches the town (say 70 mph).

I assume company officers do have the power, but how can this be validated for sure? I am using the state register database, but it only has the registered agent. They also want credit card information for this! I ask for a contract with an employer, which are requested modifications to. The company says the project manger will sign. I requested for the signature from the registered agent. The point is how can I trust a verbal confirmation that x or y has the authority to make modifications to the company policy? ","answer":"Anyone with  can bind the company. That is, authority that appears from the circumstances to exist whatever the reality may be. The persons role and the nature of the transaction feed into the circumstances. For example, consider a national supermarket chain:The cashier has ostensible authority to sell the supermarkets goods.The manager has ostensible authority to resolve customer complaints.The purchasing officer has ostensible authority to enter into contracts with suppliers.The state manager has ostensible authority to buy and sell land.The officers (CEO\/Board) has ostensible authority to do anything.Anyone who enters into a transaction with a person who has ostensible authority can rely on that to bind the company. Of course, ostensible authority ends if a reasonable person would believe (or actually knows) that the person was exceeding their actual authority, for example, if the supermarket cashier sold you the supermarket, the company wouldnt be bound.If the person acts as if they have authority and its reasonable to assume they do, then they do."}
{"question":"Certain US federal employees are required to work without pay in the event of a government shutdown (i.e. budgetary incompetence). If you are classified as an an essential employee, you must work with no idea of when you will get paid.How can this be legal? Why is it not a criminal offense as a sort of temporary enslavement?","answer":"Employees are only required to work in the sense that refusal to report can result in discipline (like reprimand or firing) and forfeit of whatever money you would have earned had you shown up. This is exactly the same way federal employees (or most employees, for that matter) are always required to work. The fact that they're not being paid on time has nothing to do with whether it's slavery. That's because pay has nothing to do with slavery. Slavery is forced labor and\/or ownership of people, and civilian federal employees are just as free to quit as they normally are. Military personnel can't freely quit, but they can never freely quit. Nothing relevant has changed for either group.Not paying employees is potentially a violation of labor law, and the government in fact lost a lawsuit after the last shutdown for violating the FLSA. If that happens this time too, they'll have to pay damages. "}
{"question":"In the US, copyright has been retroactively extended multiple times. .It was first due to enter the public domain in 1955. Then in 1986. Then in 2003. Last extension (that I know of) was until 2023 which is the year I write this.But at the same time, .So how is it possible that ex post facto copyright extensions have been passed multiple times?As I see it the victim here is the general public. Is it simply that they haven't sued for rights? Or did they?If I sign a contract that I will hand over my poem to you in two weeks, can I just change my mind and say \"no, now it's three months\" whenever I feel like it?

This related to an extension of copyright protection for works that had already fallen into the public domain.an extension of copyright is still a limited time allowed by the Constitutionhistorical practice, including by the first congress, is evidence that giving copyright protection to previously unprotected works is okaythere is a rational basis that such extensions promote the progress of sciencefair use continues to be available as a defence\/exceptionFurther, no one is liable for copies of works made while a work was in the public domain. This was not imposing retroactive, ex post facto punishment.

{"question":"I'm a leaseholder of a flat, currently going through a remortgage in the UK. The lender's solicitor has told me that they're waiting to hear back from the landlord on what \"notice of charge\" fee is applicable and they won't proceed under they have that information.There is a section on \"Notices\" in my lease, but no fee mentioned at all  neither to an amount explicitly, nor any reference (e.g. \"a reasonable fee\").

{"question":"Introduction:I had an idea for how to make a certain product much better. I'm currently in the prototyping stage for a product based on that idea. That idea (the solution to the problem of improving that product in certain ways) is patentable according to all the stuff I read about patents. But patents are really expensive: My primary market would be western Europe (member states of the European Patent Convention) and possibly later the US, that would cost a 4-digit USD amount upfront and in total a 5-digit amount within a couple of years, as far as I can tell.So I'm evaluating the possibility of just keeping my invention secret until I'm ready to sell a product based on it and then publishing the full details to make sure no one else can patent it.Question:But when I'm selling such a product: Would competitors need to design a new product based on my idea, involving all the prototyping and too easy to patent but still not trivial problems - or would it be legal to take my product apart, put the parts in a 3D scanner and produce the exact same product? Where is the border between what is allowed and what not, exactly?Hypothetical example:Say I found a new method to make car chassis more aerodynamic. There are certain equations and methods which are applied during the development process, and to keep anyone else from patenting them, I publish them (in my case, the invention is obvious from the final product). Are the competitors allowed to take the chassis I developed and use that, or do they need to design their own using my methods?","answer":"Without a patent, your inventions are not protected (except as trade secrets). If you publish your findings, anyone can use them.It is possible to patent the specific design of your chassis. Design patents, which cover the specific aesthetic design of something, can be less expensive than utility patents, which cover functional aspects. Although your chassis is designed with functionality in mind, it will also embody an aesthetic design.That said, enforcement of patent rights (or any other rights you might hope protect your chassis) is orders of magnitude more expensive (typically millions of dollars) than merely obtaining a patent. Thus, even if you do obtain protection for the chassis design or the method of designing it, your budget may make it impractical to effectively take advantage of those protections, unless a law firm is willing to take the case on contingency."}
{"question":"I read about one of the largest payday loan scammers in the United States of America being caught and eventually found guilty. The case was interesting because the company tried to avoid state law by incorporating on an Indian Reserve, theoretically meaning they would only have to comply with Federal law. Although, this did not help them in court.I was hoping, given the publicity, someone could point me to a source because I have since lost the article. In particular, I am interested in reading the misleading contract that clients signed when taking out the payday loan, which caused them to repay more money than they had initially thought.","answer":"Could it be American Web Loan?American Web Loan claimed it could charge sky-high rates because it was owned by a Native tribe, the Otoe-Missouria. The tribes sovereign status meant that the business would have immunity against state usury laws and civil suits.

{"question":"The Chicago police  (or perhaps still do) take detainees to a site at Homan Square, question them, take them a different police site and then arrest them.  Or at least that's what they claim.  Can a LEO actually move a detainee miles from the point of initial detainment without arresting them?  My intuition says that a LEO moving a detainee that far implicitly puts the detainee under arrest, even if the LEO doesn't make it official until later.","answer":"NoAn arrest is the act of detaining a person or property by legal authority or warrant and has been made when a police officer or another individual makes it clear to the person that they are no longer a free person.A person does not need to be physically touched to be placed under arrest as words alone are capable of bringing about an arrest if they establish that the person is no longer a free person.Now, if a LEO asks you to accompany them, then, so long as you have the choice not to, you are not under arrest."}
{"question":"There are two parties to a contract. Call them Party1 and Party2. The contract will take effect when Party1 meets  A, and Party2 meets condition precedent B.Party1 meets condition precedent A. Party2 does not meet condition precedent B. My understanding is that Party1, having met his obligation, condition precedent A, can now enforce the contract against Party2.

But Party2 can't enforce the contract against Party1 because he hasn't met condition precedent B. Is this, in fact, the case?Yes, although the term of 'one way contract' is odd or a misnomer because the way you describe this scenario suggests there are two independent exchanges of considerations (or of promises) consolidated in the same contract: one exchange is premised on condition precedent A only, and the other premised on condition precedent B only.For it to be otherwise, the contract would have to tie\/link Party 1's benefits to the fulfillment of condition B or to an external condition. But that would imply that not all the conditions precedent to which Party 1 is subject are met yet."}
{"question":"I found about the patent too late while searching for eventual patent. The main idea of the patent under question was entirely my own. It was first implemented in a prototype, and then a production facility was setup in Japan. The patent was issued to two other inventors. One ofthem I knew very well and we worked together on the prototype. Unfortunately, He passed away last year. I do not know the other inventor and I could not find any clue about him nor about the Company name mentioned in the patent (neither could my friends in Japan). I have all the evidence (and I have witnesses abroad, too) to prove that I am the main Inventor of the patent. Who I should contact so that my name is included as an Inventor of the patent:the law firm under the correspondence address?the US Patent Bureau?or third party law firm?Does it matter if the patent has expired because the fees have not been paid?","answer":"Correction of named inventors is covered under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256. If all the parties agree that you should be named, the inventorship could possibly be corrected by a petition (and a fee, most likely) submitted to the USPTO. Otherwise, you may be able to retain a lawyer and sue to have your name added. However, that route would likely end up being rather expensive."}
{"question":"About a month ago, I asked  over on Workplace. TL;DR: I was informally told I was being laid off, but when I asked HR about rights and benefits, they were totally unaware of any layoff.Looks like I was right to be suspicious, because there was no layoff. Now my immediate supervisor is begging me to \"extend\" my employment. I've already given them an extra two weeks. (I guess I'll find out on the 19th whether I'm actually being paid...) Now I'm being asked for another \"extension.\"I've already made financial and personal decisions with the understanding that I'm being laid off. My supervisor does not have unilateral authority to make job offers. Does being asked to \"extend\" after being \"laid off\" constitute a job offer for purposes of claiming unemployment?

If you have not yet field a claim, then it doesn't matter, only offers after a claim is field affect unemployment benefits to the best of my understanding.You could ask for a job offer in writing.

{"question":"Is a fig roll (UK, fig bar in the US) taxed as a biscuit or a cake in the UK?A Jaffa cake has been determined to be cake, not a biscuit, based in part on what happens when it goes stale. It is taxed at the lower VAT of a cake.How is a fig roll taxed? Biscuit or cake?","answer":"The relevant guidance is , at sections 3.4 and  3.6. It is surprisingly(?) confusing, the result of trying to account for exceptions both historical and otherwise motivated.The biscuit\/cake distinction is not the one to focus on, because some biscuits are zero-rated (I think this category is basically the fairly plain biscuits like custard creams or bourbons) and some are standard-rated (those with chocolate, but also some others as far as I can tell).The following are supposed to be standard-rated:biscuits wholly or partly covered in chocolate (or some productsimilar in taste and appearance)any item of sweetened prepared food,other than cakes and non-chocolate biscuits, which is normally eatenwith the fingersLater, in the 'zero-rated' column of a table of examples we have bothCakes including sponge cakes, pastries, eclairs, meringues, flapjacks,lebkuchen, marshmallow teacakes and Scottish snowballsandBiscuits coated with icing, caramel or some other product different intaste and appearance from chocolateThere is some further clarification :In most cases, the borderline between cakes and confectionery causes few problems, but there are products whose status as cakes is not self-evident. They will normally be marketed as cakes, through bakeries and supermarkets rather than through confectionery outlets, and will be displayed with cakes and biscuits rather than in the confectionery section. The style of packaging used will also normally follow the pattern for bakery products, with a number of individual portions boxed and cellophane wrapped so the contents are revealed. They are also usually eaten as part of a meal rather than between meals as confectionery.Later in that page they discuss flapjacks vs. cereal bars and admit that flapjacks are classed differently because flapjacks were around when VAT was introduced and cereal bars weren't.Based on this, I think fig rolls are likely classed as confectionery rather than cakes, so get standard-rated for tax. If they wanted to invest in the legal battle that Jaffa Cakes had, they might well win, but 'to the man on the street' they are a sweet product sold for eating between meals in its own packaging, and so they naturally fall into that intended category.EDIT: After all that, I found  who states that fig rolls are zero-rated. Perhaps they do get classified as cakes or plain biscuits, then."}
{"question":"Plaintiff sues defendant under state law in state court.On January 1, the court issues an order that would give rise to an interlocutory appeal by the defendant. Assume defendant has 30 days to file a notice of appeal.Later that day, Plaintiff amends his complaint to add claims under federal law, permitting Defendants to remove the case to federal court.Defendant believes that federal court is a more favorable venue in which to resolve the underlying claims, but that state courts would be a more favorable venue in which to resolve the issue to be appealed.Can Defendant thread that needle? If he initiates the appeal before removing the underlying case, does the appeal stay in state court? Does the appeal transfer to the federal courts?","answer":"Nobody says you have to wait until the deadline runs.Filing a notice of appeal shouldn't waive the right to remove either.Probably the safest course of action is to file a notice of appeal both before and after the removal to avoid any risk of losing the right to appeal the interlocutory order.You could file the notice of appeal and then file the removal, which insures that the appeal doesn't fail for being untimely if the federal court remands to state court.But, simply filing the removal before the notice of appeal deadline and then filing a notice of appeal in the removed action should suffice too.If he initiates the appeal before removing the underlying case, doesthe appeal stay in state court?Probably not. But it's on obscure technical point, so the result may not be 100% predictable.Does the appeal transfer to the federal courts?Probably not. You probably need to appeal separately for the appeal to survive the removal, but see above.The removal process is governed by  which states in the part pertinent to a federal question removal:(a)Generally.A defendant or defendants desiring to remove any civil action from aState court shall file in the district court of the United States forthe district and division within which such action is pending a noticeof removal signed pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of CivilProcedure and containing a short and plain statement of the groundsfor removal, together with a copy of all process, pleadings, andorders served upon such defendant or defendants in such action.(b)Requirements; Generally.(1)The notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall befiled within 30 days after the receipt by the defendant, throughservice or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forththe claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based, orwithin 30 days after the service of summons upon the defendant if suchinitial pleading has then been filed in court and is not required tobe served on the defendant, whichever period is shorter.(2)(A)When a civil action is removed solely under section 1441(a), alldefendants who have been properly joined and served must join in orconsent to the removal of the action.(B)Each defendant shall have 30 days after receipt by or service onthat defendant of the initial pleading or summons described inparagraph (1) to file the notice of removal.(C)If defendants are served at different times, and a later-serveddefendant files a notice of removal, any earlier-served defendant mayconsent to the removal even though that earlier-served defendant didnot previously initiate or consent to removal.(3)Except as provided in subsection (c), if the case stated by theinitial pleading is not removable, a notice of removal may be filedwithin thirty days after receipt by the defendant, through service orotherwise, of a copy of an amended pleading, motion, order or otherpaper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is onewhich is or has become removable.. . .(d)Notice to Adverse Parties and State Court.Promptly after the filing of such notice of removal of a civil actionthe defendant or defendants shall give written notice thereof to alladverse parties and shall file a copy of the notice with the clerk ofsuch State court, which shall effect the removal and the State courtshall proceed no further unless and until the case is remanded.. . . .(g)?

{"question":"As a hypothetical:Company A is a competitor of Company B. Management of Company A thinks that Company A is so much better than Company B that Company B will soon go out of business. After getting approval from all major stakeholders of Company A, management publicly announces plans to short Company B and provides their reasons for doing so, but these reasons are mostly subjective. For example, the management of Company A believes that Company A has a better culture, smarter employees, and more efficient processes.Later on, Company A does short Company B, and Company B shortly thereafter goes out of business, making Company A a lot of money. Has Company A (or its executives acting on Company A's behalf) committed insider trading?According to rule 240.10b5-1, insider trading is defined as:among other things, the purchase or sale of a security of anyissuer, on the basis of material nonpublic information about thatsecurity or issuer, in breach of a duty of trust or confidence that isowed directly, indirectly, or derivatively, to the issuer of thatsecurity or the shareholders of that issuer, or to any other personwho is the source of the material nonpublic information.On the one hand, there was no breach of trust as Company A, with approval from stakeholders, made a good faith effort to publicize their actions and information used to justify these actions in advance. On the other hand, a reasonable person might argue that management of Company A had an unfair advantage over other investors in Company B in that they were acting on \"nonpublic information about that security\". Specifically, management of Company A knew firsthand what Company A was actually like- information that is relevant to the prospects of their competitor, Company B. The general investing public outside of Company A had to rely on the claims of management, which might reasonably be taken with a grain of salt since many companies claim to have \"the best\" culture and talent.I understand that this question is fairly speculative, so to make things a little less theoretical, I would prefer answers that provide specific regulations, court cases, or legislation addressing the following issues central to this question:Is there some privileged information that simply cannot be acted upon even if made public since it cannot be publicly verified in an objective way (e.g. the firsthand impression of management of how well the company is doing)? To put it another way: is an indirect duty of trust owed by management of a company to the entire general investing public- not just investors in the company itself?To what extent does getting the approval of stakeholders in Company A and publicly announcing planned actions in advance protect against insider trading regulations? (Note that this is different than the typical case of employees filing plans to buy or sell stock in their company in advance because (a) this involves another company's stock and (b) the plan is publicly announced after becoming aware of information relevant to the stock price of Company B not before.)","answer":"The management of Company A does not have a duty of trust to Company BAs such, they can act on whatever information they like."}
{"question":"For example, a company that rents out car parking spaces requires that I will also buy insurance for the property inside my car, while I already have insurance for the property inside my car.For example, the company may require that the coverage for the property inside my car may only be part of home owner insurance, but not car insurance.If the coverage for the property inside my car is part of my car insurance, the company does not accept this coverage and forces me to buy another policy that covers again the property in the car, which is already covered by my car insurance.","answer":"Each of the 50 states plus non-states has their own laws, but there is nothing general about contract or other law in the US that forces a rental facility to accept customers who don't have \/ won't get the insurance that they require. It is a reasonable requirement, because it protects their interest insofar as angry customers might sue the facility because their car was broken into, and many of them would mistakenly believe that their car insurance covers theft or destruction of contents (thus leading to a desire to sue, to cover the property loss). It may be just too much hassle and too risky for them to assume the correctness of a customer's claim that they already have adequate coverage and will maintain said coverage, with no practical means to verify the claim."}
{"question":"This is a real instance, but I'm going to avoid names.I downloaded a photograph found via Google - a still from a famous show. This is an image of a television character in a known location that was part of the show. The credit for the photo is [photographer\/[famous TV company].To that I superimposed two additional characters - my own photography & green-screen process - to make it look as though they were part of the same scene. To be clear, the original character and location are still recognisable and unadulterated. The only change is it now appears that there are two other 'matching' characters in the scene. There is no hint of any defamation or ridicule of the characters, it is a simple set of 'hero poses' in a known film set location.This derivation was used for a family calendar in a print run of maybe 6.I'd call that 'fair use'.However, I'd now like to be able to post that up online.There is no hint of any profit being made, merely a 'Hey, look what I can do in Photoshop'; but let's assume I wanted to post it to Stack Exchange, which would assign a CC BY-SA 4.0 license. [As far as my limited knowledge goes] I can't do that because I don't have the right to reassign the original work. If I wanted to post to social media, Facebook etc I really don't know what license they would use\u2026 if any. It all seems a bit cavalier.I contacted the original photographer to see if he would allow this usage - however, he got back to me quickly & nicely, only to explain he doesn't own the rights himself, they were assigned to [famous TV company]. My attemps to contact [fTVc] have drawn a blank.Am I just plain out of luck?Is there still any case for it being legally considered 'mine because it is derivative or fair use' or am I still hard up against the rights of the original owner whom I cannot contact? I don't want to just 'post & be damned', I'd rather do this properly [or not at all].I'm in the UK, additional images & manipulation done UK, original photograph taken in Northern Ireland [again UK], [famous TV company] is American.","answer":"First of all there is no such thing as fair use in the UK, that is a specifically US legal concept, and it does not apply in the UK.  The UK has a legal concept that is somewhat similar, known as fair dealing but it is much more limited than the US concept of fair use. See In general Fair Dealing is an exception to copyright that permits use for:purposes of research or private study;purposes of criticism, review or quotation;purposes of reporting current events (this does not apply to photographs)None of those seem to apply to an image from a TV show or film modified to add two additional characters as if they had appeared in the original. Unless somehow this is being used for criticism of the original, but the question does not mention any such criticism.The Wikipedia article says:Under United Kingdom law, an infringer relying on fair dealing as a defence must show that their actions fall into a specific category of acceptable use, as opposed to the illustrative open list of purposes in US law.[4] The fair dealing exceptions had previously been formalised in case law as fair use forms, but this was eliminated by the Copyright Act 1911.The use as described in the question appears to be a case of copyright infringement by creating a derivative work. It does not seem to come under fair dealing in the UK, and might well not be a valid fair use under US law, either. Whether any profit is made by the infringer is not relevant. Whether the market for the original is harmed is relevant, but not decisive.However, when used for a small private circulation of less than 10 copies, it is unlikely that the copyright owner would sue, or indeed would ever learn of the existence of the infringement. if posted to the net, however, this is much less safe. Programs exist to make automated searches of the web or of images listed on search engines for images similar to a copyrighted work. If such a search finds a similar image, the copyright holder might choose to file an infringement suit. This is entirely up to the copyright holder. Such a suit might result in significant damages. It is not, however, likely to lead to criminal prosecution unless mass commercial infringement is discovered.One of the things copyright protects is the right to create, or authorize the creation of, derivative works. Thus it is never correct to say that something is mine because it is derivative. If the derivative work is made without permission, and the original is protected by copyright, than simply making the derivative work is a copyright infringement, jsut like making an unauthorized copy of the original. Fair use (in the US) or fair dealing (in the UK) is such an exception to copyright. Several of the EU nations have exceptions similar (but not identical) to the UK fair dealing. These are often called fair dealing when discussed in English. Most include exceptions for criticism and classroom instruction. None are as broad as the US fair use concept, to the best of my understanding.The only way to be fully lawful about this would be to contact the copyright holder and request permission for the derivative work, and get it. I cannot say if the holder would grant such permission, or on what terms. The holder has no duty to grant permission on any terms, or even to reply to a request. No reply must be treated the same as a reply of No!, I am afraid."}
{"question":"For context, the region I'm in is Sangamon County, Illinois.I ordered an  from their shop. I expect it to arrive before November 3rd and I am excited to wear it at the polling place. I am, however, not certain if this is permitted under the law. I checked on the Electoral Judge's manual for clarification and I found this:Electioneering is defined as working for, against, or in the interest of a candidate, party, or proposition.Electioneering is not allowed in the polling place or within the campaign free zone (a distance of within 100 horizontal feet of the room). No one is permitted to wear a campaign button, display political literature, or engage in any political discussion within the restricted area.So I interpret this as putting me in the clear. The pin is unrelated to a candidate, party, or any proposition on my region's ballots.I wanted a concrete illustration of the law so I did a search and found within the No person shall do any electioneering or soliciting of votes on primary day within any polling place or within one hundred feet of any polling place, or, at the option of a church or private school, on any of the property of that church or private school that is a polling place. Election officers shall place 2 or more cones, small United States national flags, or some other marker a distance of 100 horizontal feet from each entrance to the room used by voters to engage in voting, which shall be known as the polling room. [\u2026][\u2026] This subsection shall be construed liberally in favor of persons engaging in electioneering on all polling place property beyond the campaign free zone for the time that the polls are open on an election day.It's striking that electioneering isn't defined within the section, so I reviewed 10 ILCS 5\/0.01 et seq. and found section 5\/7-4. Definitions does not provide clarification about electioneering.Okay, maybe its a common sense term. I checked Blacks Law Dictionary 5th ed. and also found no definition of electioneering.Well maybe there's relevant case law? I reviewed West's Smith-Hurd ILCS Annotated and found there were no reported cases related to 10 ILCS 5\/0.01 et seq.Last I checked West's IL Digest and found no relevant case law. There were surprisingly only 5 cases related to elections, none of which had anything to do with electioneering.So I imagine if a judge were to make a determination about whether displaying this pin within a polling place is electioneering, they would have to refer to a dictionary definition. From Webster's:electioneer verb elec\u00b7?tion\u00b7?eer | \\ i-?lek-sh?-?nir  \\  electioneered; electioneering; electioneers Definition of electioneer intransitive verb : to take an active part in an election specifically : to work for the election of a candidate or partyWell this is incredibly unhelpful! While this pin is not working for the election of a candidate or party, my very presence in the polling place is taking an active part in an election.So in summary, would displaying this pin in a polling place be considered unlawful electioneering?","answer":"Illinois law has a bit more to say about electioneering in . The core isany broadcast, cable, or satellite communication, including radio,television, or Internet communicationwhich is really about communication, and certain other factors which are about electioneering. Such buttons clearly are not communication: the question is whether the court would apply a whole-act or whole-code canon to supply a definition when one is statutorily missing. The part that identifies electioneering is:(1) refers to (i) a clearly identified candidate or candidates whowill appear on the ballot for nomination for election, election, orretention, (ii) a clearly identified political party, or (iii) aclearly identified question of public policy that will appear on theballot...(3) is targeted to the relevant electorate, and (4) is susceptible tono reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for oragainst a clearly identified candidate for nomination for election,election, or retention, a political party, or a question of publicpolicy.The button fails to constitute electioneering in that sense, because any association between the slogan and a particular candidate is unclear. On a balance of probabilities, it most likely refers (negatively) to particular candidates, but the law is framed in terms of clear statements, and not vague implications.The law states a prohibition, but does not clearly say what the consequences of a violation are. Presumably, polling officials will tell an offender to remove the button. Under 10 ILCS 5\/29-11,Failure to comply with order of election authority. Any person whoknowingly fails or refuses to comply with any lawful order of anelection authority issued by the election authority in the performanceof the duties of the election authority, shall be guilty of a Class Amisdemeanor.Then the prosecution would have to prove that the order was lawful. A judge is highly unlikely to read just the part of the definition that says to take an active part in an election (because then I voted stickers would be illegal). The whole definition specifically limits this to candidates and parties (which omits ballot propositions: that definition is defective)."}
{"question":"States and counties in the U.S.A. can have court rules, such as: (including uniform rules)Who sets these rules? If it's not the legislature, by what authority?","answer":"In most US states such rules are set by the state's highest court, often but not always known as the State Supreme Court. The legislature could set such rules, but normally does not. It may authorize the court to do so.Mote that the Oregon rules (on a  easy to reach for the one linked above) say:Proposed changes to the Uniform Trial Court Rules (UTCR) and Supplementary Local Rules (SLR) are reviewed annually by the UTCR Committee.  The committee makes recommendations to approve, disapprove or modify these proposals.  After considering these recommendations, the Chief Justice or the entire Supreme Court, reaches a final decision on whether to approve or disapprove a proposed change.The  state:**Rule 1. PREAMBLE **-<br \/>Pursuant to the inherent powers of the Court and Article VI, Section IX, Paragraph I of the Georgia Constitution of 1983, and in order to provide for the speedy, efficient and inexpensive resolution of disputes and prosecutions, these rules are promulgated.Rule 1.6<br \/>The Council of Superior Court Judges shall have a permanent committee to recommend to the Supreme Court such changes and additions to these rules as may from time to time appear necessary or desirable. [Emphasis added]Many other states have somewhat similar procedures. Others including NY and California, set more of the rules by statute.On the Federal level, the various Federal Rules of Procedure (Civil, Criminal, and Supreme Court, perhaps others) are set by the Supreme Court, although they are usually drafted by an ABA committee Court appointed advisory committee and submitted to the Court for approval, I understand.  Many (but not all) state rules closely imitate the Federal rules, down to the numbering and wording in many cases."}
{"question":"Say that I have created a hypothetical new invention. I would like for it to be used by as many people as possible without restrictions, so I deliberately choose not to pursue a patent on it.As described in the answers to , someone else can patent my invention unless the US Patent Office is aware that there is prior art, established by me producing and selling my invention. The trouble is, I can't necessarily guarantee that they will become aware of my prior art if I'm not particularly well-known.What can be done to ensure that the patent office knows about my prior work (which I deliberately choose not to patent) and therefore doesn't unintentionally grant a patent to someone else?","answer":"Producing or selling the invention are not the only ways to establish prior art. A simple publication detailing the invention would also suffice, from a strictly legal perspective (the publication qualifies as prior art under 35 USC 102). It is possible that the USPTO (specifically, the Examiner responsible for finding prior art to reject another application) will not be aware of the publication, and in this regard a generic publication is typically worse than a US Patent Application. It is possible to for a third party to submit prior art relevant to a pending application, but doing so would require you to be aware that there was a relevant application pending (which might not even be possible, if the application was allowed before the 18 month publication date).However, as long as you have evidence of the date the publication was made, you could rest assured that any patent issued on the invention would be easily invalidated (assuming the patent application was submitted after your publication date). Then, if the patent owner threatened to sue you for infringement, you could show them the publication and they would likely drop the issue.There are also options to go through the USPTO to invalidate an issued patent, such as IPRs. However, these proceedings, while not as costly as patent litigation in court, can still be quite costly and complex."}
{"question":"There is a question on workplace.SE about a company which offered to pay travel costs for a job interview, but canceled the return ticket after ending the interview - .Generally, when arranging a job interview which requires the candidate to travel, it is common for the potential employer to pay travel cost and lodging for the candidate. In practice, the employer will ususally offer this, often in writing, but not write up a formal contract or similar document.In that situation, can the employer later renege on the promise to pay costs? In particular, can they renege after the candidate has begun their journey, thus saddling the candidate with the travel cost?My thoughts:On the one hand, a simple one-sided promise is usually not binding, as a binding agreement requires both sides to give something (called  in Common law).On the other hand, there is the notion of , which appears to fit here. Also, one could argue that the candidate does provide something in exchange, namely their presence and willingness to attend the interview (basically, the company trades travel costs for having the candidate  present for the interview).So, is the promise to pay the candidate's cost enforceable or not?Im interested in any jurisdiction, particularly European and US.","answer":"This aspect (and many others) of contract law is applicable in the US and various countries of the EU.can they renege after the candidate has begun their journey, thussaddling the candidate with the travel cost?No. The company would incur breach of contract.There is no need for a formal contract. The candidate only needs to prove that the company agreed (in writing, orally or clearly through its conduct) to cover or reimburse those expenses and that this elicited a .The agreement would be void if the candidate incurred the expenses despite knowing (via timely notice) that the company changed its mind.Likewise, if the candidate lied on his CV, the contract (here, the company's agreement to cover the expenses) would be voidable by the company, since the candidate's intentional misrepresentations preclude the aforementioned condition of meeting of the minds.--Edited on 1\/18\/2019 to add ...--Per  by @KRyan, the aspect of void or voidable contract is expanded.

The Workplace SE postreflects a company's breach of contract. The subsequent comments here about fraudhypotheticals are mostly derivative inquiries beyond whatis described in Workplace SE. In particular, we do not assumewhatsoever that the stranded candidate committed fraud. commented:can the contract be voided on the spot like that without firstproving in court? As it seems like it grants a rather vigilantejustice power that is open to abuse, since effectively thepunishment (cancellation of the flight and thus inducing a ratherserious physical situation) is administered before any due process hasbeen afforded the one accused.Yes, it can be voided on the spot (aka sua sponte).Vigilante justice denotes a self-attribution of punitive powers that exclusively belong to the state\/government\/court, whereas a party's voiding of a contract is the act of foreclosing his losses\/exposures with respect to a contract that de facto never existed (such as when that contract was induced by fraud).I agree that unfortunately that is open to abuse: As a pretext to actually incur breach of contract, a company might allege that the contract was void. That is why (if taken to court) it will be the company's burden to prove that (1) it reasonably relied upon a candidate's representations (2) which were significant and blatantly false (3) given the candidate's knowledge that his lies contravened the job's core requirements.That can be quite burdensome. For instance, is the company handing out airfares without first conducting some competent corroborations about the candidate's credentials\/skills? If so, one can hardly concede the company's allegation of reasonable reliance. The resulting finding would be that the contract was not voidable by the company, and thus that it is liable for breach of contract.Also, belatedly informing the stranded candidate that the company is going in a different direction falls short of evidencing that the contract was voidable. That applies even if the candidate  or screening process.Given the hardship imposed on a stranded candidate, a company has to be morally and legally very judicious about its method and timing for going in a different direction.But absent any representations or [company's] bylaws to the contrary, a company generally does not have the obligation to afford due process to a candidate. The court is the entity with an obligation to enforce due process as provided by law (although many of us in the U.S. have repeatedly experienced the courts' disavowal of due process).--End of edit on 1\/19\/2019--a binding agreement requires both sides to give somethingHere, the candidate's consideration is his time and effort to accommodate the company's interest in assessing the candidate's profile at a location that is convenient to the company."}

{"question":"A turning point for the Trump campaigns legal efforts came on Nov. 13, when its core team of professional lawyers saw the writing on the wall. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia delivered a stinging defeat to Trump allies in a lawsuit trying to invalidate all Pennsylvania ballots received after Election Day.The decision didnt just reject the claim; it denied the plaintiffs standing in any federal challenge under the Constitutions electors clause  an outcome that Trumps legal team recognized as a potentially fatal blow to many of the campaigns challenges in the state.I don't understand the highlighted text. It's written in English, but not in the English that I can comprehend.

The decision is .The court gives a pretty clear explanation of the concept of standing on pages 19-20 of the opinion:Article III standing doctrine speaks in jargon, but thegist of its meaning is plain enough.

As we will explain below,Plaintiffs here have not suffered a concrete, particularized, andnon-speculative injury necessary under the U.S. Constitutionfor them to bring this federal lawsuit.So the court held that the plaintiffs do not have standing: that the alleged actions of the defendants, even if they are assumed to have happened as the plaintiffs claim, would not violate the plaintiffs' Constitutional rights.  As such, the court is not even going to consider whether the plaintiffs' claims are factual, or whether Pennsylvania's actions were illegal, or whether the remedies the plaintiffs seek are appropriate.

{"question":"A friend of mine was dating, and nearly married an immigrant woman. While she was in the 'old country,' her parents had her sterilized under circumstances that would be illegal in the U.S. but permissible in the other country. (This happened while the girl was undergoing another operation, so she wasn't even informed.) Only when she went to the doctor for a pre marital check up was this discovered.Since my friend wanted children, they broke up the engagement. But suppose he had found out after the wedding. What rights would he have in the United States? Could he have the marriage annulled as opposed to file for divorce? Could he sue the girl's parents for doing this and not telling her about it?","answer":"The full answer is too broad (it's a 50-state survey question). Here is a starter, though. In  may be sought if  (i) The marriage or domestic partnership should not have been  contracted because of age of one or both of the parties, lack of  required parental or court approval, a prior undissolved marriage of  one or both of the parties, a prior domestic partnership of one or  both parties that has not been terminated or dissolved, reasons of  consanguinity, or because a party lacked capacity to consent to the  marriage or domestic partnership, either because of mental incapacity  or because of the influence of alcohol or other incapacitating  substances, or because a party was induced to enter into the marriage  or domestic partnership by force or duress, or by fraud involving the  essentials of marriage or domestic partnership, and that the parties  have not ratified their marriage or domestic partnership by  voluntarily cohabiting after attaining the age of consent, or after  attaining capacity to consent, or after cessation of the force or  duress or discovery of the fraud, shall declare the marriage or  domestic partnership invalid as of the date it was purportedly  contractedBut then also  (ii) The marriage or domestic partnership should not have been  contracted because of any reason other than those above, shall upon  motion of a party, order any action which may be appropriate to  complete or to correct the record and enter a decree declaring such  marriage or domestic partnership to be valid for all purposes from the  date upon which it was purportedly contractedSo an annulment would have to fit into one of these latter unspecified reasons. Although material fraud is considered to be such a reason, the closest case (), the WA Supreme Court avoided deciding whether a particular instance of alleged fraud sufficed to invalidate a marriage, since in addition one party was incompetent and the marriage was not solemnized, as required by state law.In Radochonski v. Radochonski (1998 Wash. App. LEXIS 765), the husband sought adeclaration of invalidity of marriage based on fraud in the essentials of the marriage (the allegation was that the wife entered into the marriage to get permanent residency). The petition was denied because 'the alleged fraud does not go to the 'essentials' of marriage' and because he 'cannot demonstrate reasonable reliance on any statements Barbara made as to her motive in marrying him'. The court notes that there is only one case, , addressing what the essentials of marriage are:  where one of the parties to a marriage ceremony determines before the  ceremony that he or she will not engage in sexual intercourse with the  other after marriage, not disclosing such intention to the other, and  carries out such determination, the offending spouse commits a fraud  in the contract of marriage affecting an essential of the marital  relation, against which the injured party may be relieved by annulment  of the marriage.The court said that fraud in an essential may be found (citing cases in other states)   where one spouse has misled another on an attribute that prevents  sexual relations between the parties such as impotence, venereal  disease, and drug abuse, the latter on the theory that narcotics cause  impotence. These attributes have gone to the essentials of marriage  because they affected the sexual relations that are at the heart of  the marriagebut no so in the case of   premarital chastity, false representations as to love and affection,  misrepresentation of affection, failure to disclose out-of-wedlock  children, fraudulent representation of pregnancy, and failure to end a  previous relationship.So it is highly unlikely that fraud in the essentials of marriage would be found at least in Washington.

Does that mean I can start the app without having to worry about trademark issues?The most active one is by bree.com, but that's selling bags: ","answer":"As a general principal, under US law (and that of several other countries as well, but I am less sure there) trademarks are protected only in the field\/industry in which they are actually used in trade. Protection is also limited by the geographic area in which trademarks are used in trade. There is an exception for 'famous' or 'widely known' trademarks which get additional protection. So a trademark for 'Avalon' as a brand of beer would not prevent using 'Avalon' as a motor oil, say. It might prevent using 'Avalon' as a wine label. However, weather any of the existing trademarks 'Bree' is close enough for your use to be an infringement would require a trademark lawyer or other expert to answer. If you are able to register your proposed trademark successfully, you will have good reason to think it is not infringing. of course in the US (unlike some countries) a trademark can gain some protection from mere use without registration, and you may wish to go that route (lower fees)."}

Assuming it's not, how does it change my situation? Is this the proper way to check if it's registered?EDIT: It turns out this comapny is registered, but only in California.","answer":"I can't answer this for all of Europe, but in the UK you can pick your company name as long as it cannot be confused with the name of another UK company (and some other rules, like you cannot name it Her Royal Majesty's Game Studio). Both companies may want to register trademarks, and if they register a trademark in the USA that you registered in the EU, then they cannot use their trademark in the EU, and you can't use yours in the USA. You can register your trademark in the USA if you're quicker. When you try to register a trademark in the USA, anyone with a valid interest can protest against it.

{"question":"There is  about the same subject but it is applicable to the United States.

What I am curious about is what the UK employment law would say about the relationship in cases where a gay priest decides to 'come out'.

And when the child turns 18 then they will need to either renounce their foreign citizenship or Indian citizenship. In general by acquiring foreign citizenship the individual is deemed to have lost their Indian citizenship, however the issue is that a minor cannot renounce their Indian citizenship.This is the route that I have personally taken and my child holds both an Indian and American passport.Now getting to your particular question, the short answer is yes your child is eligible to acquire Indian citizenship by registration.

{"question":"John signs a contract with Jane to buy a car, but he forges Joe's signature. Obviously, Joe isn't bound to the contract (at least, if he can prove he didn't sign it). Is John bound by it?","answer":"The signature is a formality indicating the existence of an agreement between two parties. There does exist an agreement between John and Jane, though John is poses as another person (for no obvious reason).

Joe can proffer evidence (such as Jane's testimony) proving that he did not agree to the transaction. Jane can likewise proffer evidence proving that Joe did agree to the transaction. If the court concludes that Joe most likely did agree to the sale, it will conclude that he is bound by the contract, forged signature and assumed identity notwithstanding."}
{"question":"I was wondering what constitutes a provocation to which it is justifiable to use force as self defense. For example, if someone came a slapped you on the face but did not proceed hitting you (at which point it could be claimed he no longer presented threatening force to you), would it be okay to punch him and not be legally liable?  Or if someone started getting in your face but not really touch you, would it be legally okay to punch them to get them out of your face? What are some examples of provocation that the law would be sympathetic with the target using physical force against?  In general, what are some guidelines, in the U.S., to know when it is okay to respond with physical force?  Is ANY violence (e.g. a humiliating act like slapping somebody) enough to exempt the victim from ...  beating the c**p out of or shooting the perpetrator?  At which point does shooting the perpetrator becomes fair game because their actions constituted a legitimate threat?","answer":"The general rule is that using force in self-defense is justified if the person using the force reasonably believes it immediately is necessary to prevent the unlawful use of force against themselves or a third party. Deadly force is not generally justified except in response to a reasonable fear of deadly force, or to prevent certain violent crimes (like rape, kidnapping, robbery, etc.) Force is not justified in retaliation. In some states, if you're not at home (or maybe even then), you also have a duty to retreat before you can use deadly force in self-defense.So, for your specific questions:If they hit you once but aren't continuing to hit you, it's illegal to hit them back. You can only use force to defend yourself, not to get even.If someone gets in your face without touching you, you might be allowed to use force, but it depends on the circumstances. You don't have to wait for someone to hit you, but you can't sucker-punch someone because you want more space in a mosh pit.Your use of force needs to be something you reasonably believe to be necessary to stop\/prevent their unlawful use of force. It also needs to be proportional to the force you're defending against; you can meet deadly force with deadly force, but shooting someone to stop them from slapping you is murder. Likewise, no one's going to believe that you really thought you had to beat the crap out of someone in order to stop them from slapping you, or that it's in any way proportionate to what they did.Deadly force is not allowed in defense of a person unless you reasonably think deadly force is needed to prevent the unlawful use of deadly force, or to prevent one of a few crimes being committed against them. Depending on the state, it might be presumptively justified if the person is trying to forcibly break into your occupied house, car, or place of business, but that's state-dependent."}

Now the large site comes after my site and sends a DMCA notice to my hosting provider, asking us to take down quite some of our most popular products.While it's absolutely a false claim and it's possible that they had no idea we were licensed just as they were, it seems I have to take down the infringing materials and send back a counter-notice and wait for 14 days?My question is is this fair?14 days are enough for Google to de-index the page and for it to lose all the ranking juices. Not to mention the sales losses.What if they actually know we are licensed but just wanted to ruin our site rankings and keep coming after us in future?Do we still have to follow the legal procedures to take down whatever products they claim infringing for 14 days? What better options do we have here?UpdateAfter I first posted this question, my host restored the allegedly infringing product after 14 days of my providing the counter DMCA notice. Now the same complaint is after us again on another of our popular products. This is really annoying and stupid. How can I end this once and for all? We are not physically in United States, can we still find someone to win the lawsuit for us? Or is there any other way to stop them?","answer":"The most important fact to remember is that under , you do not make a judgment of the merits of the allegation, you simply follow the rules. The second most important fact to remember is that you have to follow the rules exactly. The point of the rules is that it immunizes you from being sued either by the uploader or by the copyright holder. I'm speaking to 'you' as though you are a provider, who has received a proper DMCA takedown notice.The service provider takes down the allegedly infringing material, having gotten notice. The uploader can then file a proper counter-claim with the ISP. The ISP notifies the complainer of the counter-claim and waits between 10 to 14 days for the him to (claim to) file lawsuit; if they don't, the ISP puts the material back up (otherwise, the courts sort it out).The uploader does not have any requirement to take material down (that requirement is imposed on the service provider). The uploader can (1) provide a proper counter-claim to get the material restored and (2) possibly sue the complainer for filing a false DMCA complaint (the statements that are filed have a 'penalty of perjury' requirement associated with them). Option (2) is a mild long-shot because you'd have to prove that they knew their statement was false. If the material is actually licensed by a third party such as a photographer, that would clearly be a false statement (the complaint has to be filed by the copyright holder, not a person who has licensed the protected material). One of the requirements for the take-down notice is 'A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed'. When you license material from an owner, you do not gain authorization to act on behalf of the owner: claiming that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner (or are the owner) is a false statement."}
{"question":"I'm nonplussed.

Finally, you will identify any cases that discuss or clarify the applicationor content of the statute in question, again relying on yourlecture notes and reading materials to point you in the right direction.You also need to know the extent to which other acts relate tothe statute in question. For example, the Unfair Contract Terms Act1977 incorporates, by reference, the concept of the common dutyof care under the Occupiers Liability Act 1957 and the OccupiersLiability Act (Northern Ireland) 1957 (see section 1(1)(c)). The 1977Act also relates to obligations arising under the Sale of Goods Act1979 and the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 (see section6(1)).

Again, in a simple statute, the cross-referencing to other enactmentsmay be easily identifiable. In those cases, you would simplyhighlight the cross-references. You would not need to make a separatelist of the potential areas of statutory overlap, as you would dowith a complex statute such as the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.However, no matter how complex your statute is, it is always good tomake a single list of the cases which discuss your statute and the statutes\/sections to which they relate. Compilation of a single list is necessarybecause you may learn about the cases at different points overthe term. It is astounding how much more easily you can remember aseries of cases if you have them all listed in a single place.Now I copy and paste section 11(4)of the 1977 Act.(4) Where by reference to a contract term or notice a person seeks to restrict liability to a specified sum of money, and the question arises (under this or any other Act) whether the term or notice satisfies the requirement of reasonableness, regard shall be had in particular (but without prejudice to subsection (2) above in the case of contract terms) to(a) the resources which he could expect to be available to him for the purpose of meeting the liability should it arise; and(b) how far it was open to him to cover himself by insurance.Page 17.

In practice, the vast majority of statutes will be self-evidently non-applicable. In this example, we are talking about contract law so statutes about crime, defence, fishing, aerospace, farming etc. are clearly not relevant. So, a practitioner needs to know which statutes will bear on contract law, and specifically on limitation of liability, and look at those.No one said studying law was easy."}

{"question":"I have read conflicting information about police in the United States arresting people for not paying a bill from a retail vendor, like a taxi driver, auto mechanic or restaurant.On one hand my understanding is that in all states if you owe money to a vendor, then they have to sue you to collect it. It would seem unlikely to me that a vendor's complaint that you did not pay them would constitute the basis for a criminal arrest. For what?On the other hand I keep reading what are essentially rumors on the internet that the police can and will arrest you if a store keeper or other vendor complains that you have not paid them AFTER THE FACT. For example, I read one case where a guy left an auto mechanic's shop after the mechanic tried to add an unapproved \"diagnostic\" charge to a bill and later he got a phone call from the police who threatened to arrest him if he did not go back to the shop and pay the mechanic the disputed charge. Allegedly the cop told him, \"You have to pay him or I will arrest you. You can sue him later if you want to.\" I have read similar things where it is claimed if you leave a cab and do not pay, the driver can chase after you and if he can somehow find you, then he can have you arrested.So, what is the reality here? Does this even happen and what are the laws involved here? I mean I guess if I could get somebody arrested by just saying to the police that they owed me money, there are a lot of people I could get arrested.UPDATE: I think Frederick's comment is very relevant in that the complex question seems to be whether there is \"intent\" to defraud, in other words, did the customer set out to obtain the services with no intention of paying in the beginning, or did they later refuse or fail to pay for some reason that had no relation to their original intent.

{"question":"In , it was determined that after taking a Driving Safety Course, a record of such action is placed upon one's driving record.Taking the course in Texas could be for either dismissing a ticket, or for obtaining an insurance discount.If one has a jury trial for speeding, and intends to claim a spotless driving record (which happens to show the course), , what is to happen in regards to the jury selection?Are people who have themselves been charged for speeding, excluded from the jury pool?  Or only those that have been convicted?  What about those whose cases have been dismissed, including through the Driving Safety Course option?As per , is it fair to assume that reasons a Driving Safety Course is taken for is not common knowledge?  Does it follow that those prospective jurors that do know should be disqualified?  Would it be the responsibility\/job of the defendant or the judge to disqualify such jurors, provided the defendant has informed the judge (and prosecutor) of the concern?  How would this be done in practice without revealing the concern to all the juries when trying to disqualify a single one at a time, because the whole selection process is generally performed in the open, and in the presence of all the prospective jurors at once, isn't it?Or would it just be allowed to take the statement about a clean record at face value, e.g., with the confirmation of the prosecutor, without the jurors being capable of examining the driving record from the DMV?","answer":"In Texas speeding is a class C misdemeanor and thus a criminal offense. Prior guilt should not be a factor in determining guilt in a trial. The prosecution would thus not present a copy of your driving record as evidence at the trial.I don't think that people who've been charged with speeding are excluded from the jury pool. Each side gets a chance to exclude jurors in a process called Voire Dire. In Texas for speeding, they'll want to choose 6 jurors.Each side gets to exclude jurors during this process. You can pick 3 people to exclude for any reason you want. You can decide which ones by asking them questions. Each side also gets to exclude jurors 'for cause' which usually means if you ask them if they can be impartial and they say no. There are also other reasons, but the judge will have to agree to your reasons.You have the option of choosing whether you want the jury or the judge to determine your fine if the jury finds you guilty. In that phase, I do believe they can take prior findings of guilt into account. But they probably won't. The prosecutor is going to ask the judge or jury to give you the maximum fine.You need to ask the judge BEFORE the trial starts who you would like to assess the fine should you be found guilty; the judge or the jury.Ask the court clerk if the court is a 'court of record.'In my experience (which is limited and I am not a lawyer) juries in Texas usually assess lower fines than a judge.There is at least one situation where you might want the judge to assess the fine;If you are found guilty in a court that is NOT a court of record, you can appeal the verdict by posting a bond in the amount of double the fine plus court costs. You must appeal and post this bond within 10 calendar days of the finding of guilt.If you do this, the case goes to a court of record (usually the county criminal court) and you get a brand new trial which starts over anew (called 'de novo') and at this trial, it all starts over again and the original trial doesn't mater at all.At this trial, it would be wise to ask the judge to assess punishment if you are found guilty by the jury. If you are found guilty by the jury, and BEFORE the judge can assess the fine, ask the judge to please allow you to be assessed 'deferred adjudication' - and if you are lucky, the judge very well may do it. BUT - be prepared to show this law to the judge. Because it's nearly a guarantee that the judge of this court (a real criminal court) won't know about it because that judge will likely not ever see many class C or speeding ticket cases. See Texas Code of Criminal Procedure 45.051  Suspension of Sentence and Deferral of Final Disposition:  On a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by a defendant or on a finding of guilt in a misdemeanor case punishable by fine only and payment of all court costs, the judge may defer further proceedings without entering an adjudication of guilt and place the defendant on probation for a period not to exceed 180 days"}
{"question":"In one of my favorite films of all time, 1992's , at the end of the trial when it's abundantly clear the prosecution will lose, at least that's the conclusion the filmmakers want the audience to surmise, Trotter pronounces... \"the state would like to dismiss all charges.\"And . . . as per Hollywood, everyone rejoices.I am fully aware movies are movies and not real life and the film is a pure work of fiction. Since I have no direct connection to anyone in the legal field, I thought I would ask some knowledgeable users about something that's always had me wondering. (Just saw the film again tonight.)I am aware that an acquittal means one can not be tried for the same crime again (double jeopardy). But a dismissal may not provide such protection. Acquittal meaning the prosecution could not prove the defendant committed the crime, whereas dismissal may allow for retrial.So, is there a legal basis for Trotter dismissing a case merely because he'll clearly lose? Common sense leans towards thinking this may be \"Hollywood fluff\" and it could not actually happen at the final stages of a trial so close to jury deliberation. But.. again, I don't really know.I think this is fluff because if it were actually possible, why wouldn't all prosecutors merely drop charges if they fear they are going to lose, then go build a better case and retry the defendant.Are the requirement for an actual dismissal more stringent than the film would have the audience believe or in this aspect, is the film pretty close to reality?(I am referencing U.S. criminal law in general)","answer":"This is entirely possible in a number of different motions that could have been made.  At this point, Vinny had destroyed the Prosecutor's eyewitnesses by showing they had issues that called their testimony into question (The first has a timeline that doesn't line up with events, the second has poor vision and her prescription glasses were not doing their job, and the third had many obstructions blocking his view of the scene).  His first witness tears apart the expert witness, who was only there to testify that the tires were the same brand (albeit, a popular brand at the time... loads of cars had the same tires).While it might go by a different name in different jurisdictions, the Prosecutor is allowed to make a motion to dismiss at any point prior to the jury goes to deliberation (as is the Defense;  Also they might be able to make motions while the jury is in deliberations).If properly titled, the Prosecutor should have made a motion for nolle prosequi (not prosecuting).  This can mean any number of things including the prosecutor no longer believes the evidence can prove the charges OR even that the prosecutor is no longer convinced that those charged committed the crime.In the My Cousin Vinny case, as the jury was seated the case cannot be retried by the State of Alabama at this point.This is possible because the Prosecutor's duty is to uncover the truth behind a crime, no matter what that truth becomes.  In this case, despite his previous beliefs, the prosecutor in My Cousin Vinny, upon realizing he was wrong, admitted it and dropped the charges.  Given his backstory of having worked as a defense attorney and making the switch after getting a client off some serious charges (and knowing the client was guilty) shows that he was inherently an honest man and dedicated to finding the truth of the matter (as a government employee, he undoubtedly took a pay cut when he switched to prosecution.  Private industry almost always pays way more than a government equivalent).  With that in mind, it is expected of prosecutors to be perfectly honest with what evidence they have and make the choices in the case based on that evidence.  This comes up in another scene when Mona Lisa Vito explains to Vinny that the prosecutor was required to give Vinny all the files he had on the case... because Vinny, by representing the Defendant, is allowed to examine all evidence against his clients.  The only dirty trick he pulled was the stunt where his expert witness was not disclosed and while bad, really it's the judge allowing the witness to testify that would have caused a problem with the trial (his response to Vinny's objection could have created a mistrial on appeal).To give a real world example, I was charged with driving on a suspended license which I had no idea I was doing at the time.  As it turned out, the license was suspended for an unpaid traffic ticket that I had paid in the last minute... essentially the DMV forgot to unsuspend.  A quick call fixed that issue but I still had to go to court over the charge.  The day of the trial, I show up in the court room and the prosecutor walks over and tells me that they were going to enter a motion of nolle prosequi for the charge... essentially dropping it... because the matter was a clerical error on the state's part and not anything I did wrong.Edit:  Additionally had the prosecutor not motioned to dismiss, Vinny certainly could have.  In fact there are two points during the trial where Defense attorneys are expected to make these motions.  The first is when the Prosecution rests their case.   The second is before the jury is given the case to deliberate.As for why it was called a motion to dismiss in the film, it's likely to due with the fact that the audience would not know what a motion for nolle prosecui and it is a type of motion to dismiss."}
{"question":"Suppose a person borrows money from a relative or friend, say, 10 million USD, without documentary evidence  the transaction is purely based on trust and cultural norms. If the borrower invests the money in real estate and after 5 years returns the borrowed amount to the lender, can this be treated as money laundering?","answer":"According to the United States Treasury Department:  Money laundering is the process of making illegally-gained proceeds (i.e. 'dirty money') appear legal (i.e. 'clean'). Typically, it involves three steps: placement, layering and integration. First, the illegitimate funds are furtively introduced into the legitimate financial system. Then, the money is moved around to create confusion, sometimes by wiring or transferring through numerous accounts. Finally, it is integrated into the financial system through additional transactions until the 'dirty money' appears 'clean.'I have no idea if the $10m are proceeds of crime so we apply the duck test - 'If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck and swims like a duck; its probably a duck'A person has gifted another person $10m - there is nothing illegal about giving someone a gift, however, this is a pretty substantial gift. I am calling it a gift because there is no enforceable contract that requires repayment.There is an expectation that the receiver will invest this money for a period of time, hey, if I had $10m I'd probably invest it too.And then return it to the giver; with or without the earnings (you do not say). Again there is nothing wrong with reciprocating a gift; reciprocity is a cornerstone of most societies, however, this is a pretty detailed understanding of what reciprocity means.Quack, quack, quack - its money laundering.Many jurisdictions in the world have 'unexplained wealth' laws which basically require a person to explain their unexplained wealth or have it confiscated.

However, disclosing classified information without authorization can be a crime in some circumstances.  If the article discloses classified information from the document, then that might be a crime.

{"question":"While looking up my most favorite in-rem case (), I stumbled over a few quite strange ones:All of these are named \"Item v State\" and technically, it was a representative for the items' owners that sued, but how come we name these cases \"Item vs. State\"  and not \"Representative for Item vs. State\" or \"Owner v State\"?","answer":"The reason is that the item did a wrong, therefore the police are seizing the item. A   against the item  will be filed by the government. The item is not protected by the Constitution, and in case the owner finds out and sues, the government's case rests on whether the item has the result of relation to a crime, and they just have to prove that it is more likely than not (the owner does not have to be even allegedly culpable). As that article says,Civil forfeiture rests on the idea (a legal fiction) that theproperty itself, not the owner, has violated the law. Thus, theproceeding is directed against the res, or the thing involved in someillegal activity specified by statute. Unlike criminal forfeiture, inrem forfeiture does not require a conviction or even an officialcriminal charge against the owner.In the , because the car complained about that ruling where the Commonwealth complained about the car: this explains the order of parties being different."}

{"question":"Suppose police conduct an illegal search of a residence (no warrant, no consent, no probable cause) and find a dead body. There is plenty of evidence in plain sight that it was a murder and also evidence of who the killer is: he is standing next to the body with the murder weapon in his hand.The murderer, being a smart lawyer, keeps his mouth shut.Would all of the evidence found during the search be excluded under the 'fruit of the poisonous tree' doctrine? If so, how could the murderer be prosecuted?","answer":"If that which you describe in your comment ( Facebook post as only basis for warrantless search) is, and can be shown, to be the only basis for the search, and there was no evidence of a crime in plain view when they arrived.....then yes, it is likely the search and all evidence acquired from the search would be excludable. As to whether the individual could still be prosecuted, that depends if a case could be built independent of the evidence collected during the search. "}

{"question":"Many years ago, probably some time around 1990, a lawyer was sent around my employer (in the UK) to brief all the programmers about the need to include a proper copyright notice at the top of every source code file, including the \"?\" c-in-a-circle copyright symbol.We programmers tried to explain that the ASCII character set did not include the copyright symbol, and hence our practice was to use \"(c)\" c-in-brackets. The lawyer replied that this was not acceptable, it had to be a proper c-in-a-circle, and it was up to us techies to figure out how to do it. Needless to say we let him go on his way and carried on using \"(c)\" because there was nothing else we could do.According to  the US Copyright office has always accepted \"(c)\", but it says nothing about other countries. And there are still some countries that are not signatories to the Berne Convention.These days of course putting the proper symbol in source code is not a problem as long as your programming tools can handle Unicode.

So if this happened in February 1989, the lawyer was correct that you needed to include a proper copyright notice.But he was probably mistaken to think that your rendering was problematic. The copyright symbol required was the same circled C that you mentioned, but the Copyright Office will also recognize a variant on the symbol if it resembles the ? closely enough to indicate clearly that the variant is intended to be the copyright symbol. The  makes clear that your variant would be sufficient:Acceptable variants include:The letter c with a parenthesis over the top.The letter c with a parenthesis under the bottom.(cc)(c)The letter c with an unenclosed circle around it.Examples of unacceptable variants on the ? symbol include the following:COCC\/O@ (i.e., the letter a in a circle).The letter c with a circle attached to the bottom of the letter.The letter c in a square.[c]The same was true under the .

If shell companies are used to \"shuffle assets\" between, say companies A, B, and C, so that the assets and liabilities are separated, is this still legal?

Its Section 4 also provides an elaborate mechanism whereby 'the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide' can precipitate a process that would allow Congress, within 21 days, to transfer the office to the Vice President.Otherwise, there is no contemplation in the law of a 'backsies' mechanism for removing a person from the office because 'it should have gone to someone else.'(The idea that a person who was in the designated line of succession, but in the wrong order, was sworn into office does not seem nearly as problematic as other events that have happened in real history.

However, the realization at the time was that any legal challenges or decisions after that date would be moot, because 'election error' is not a cause to remove a sitting U.S. President.)The question of a previous President reappearing, and his successor refusing to cede the office, takes us to the height of speculation.

Some of these differing interpretations involve what seems like major questions of rights that such as in  about warrentless seizures of a person based on suspicion of the person having committed a misdemeanor.Would it pass constitutional muster for the U.S. code to enact de jure laws that have these de facto effects, i.e. a law that says in Texas police have this power and in Florida they do not, etc.?If not,  is there any legal scholarship arguing that whatever legal principle would prevent the law from being made intentionally should also preclude the de facto situation being allowed to stand rather than having some forcing mechanism for resolution,  whether through congress or the Supreme court?  I know this obviously isn't the case now as circuit splits do exist and have these effects,  just wondering if anyone in the Academy is putting forth arguments against it.","answer":"<sup>(The original title of your question suggested you might think that federal circuit precedent binds state courts: , even on matters of federal law.)<\/sup>But regardless, Congress would not be able to legislatively lower the constitutional floor. If a certain police act is prohibited by the Constitution, Congress cannot legislatively allow that act, whether in a single state or uniformly across all states. That means that if the Fifth Circuit has decided that the use of some new investigatory tool is a search under the Fourth Amendment, no law that Congress passes could affect that holding.When congress creates laws that result in different effects for different people (e.g. people in Texas vs. people in Florida, as in your hypothetical), the distinction must be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. Many of the enumerated powers allow for local distinction, some prohibit it. Some examples where Congress has distinguished between states include: localized agricultural programs, time zones, voting rights protections, and various others listed in . Some distinctions between states could also intrude on principles of federalism and state sovereignty (e.g. the Supreme Court has said that the Voting Right Act does this).Maybe I am unimaginative, but I cannot think of a legitimate federal government purpose that would call for the powers that police have against the people to vary from state to state.

{"question":"As I understand it, the \"Right to Remain Silent\" errs on the side of innocence in the USA justice system.Jurors are usually supposed to rule as if the defendant testified in the manner voiced by his attorney(in opening and closing arguments) even if the defendant does not really testify.What would be the harm in removing this right when questions are asked through his attorney with a longallowed response time?  For example, suppose the judicial system (and even the police in the executivesystem) allowed questions like \"Were you inside your house at any time on March 30, 2021?\" and requiredan answer of either \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"I don't recall\" (with allowance for further supplemental informationif the defendant wants to clarify further).  There might be a limit of only a few such forced questions,but answers to these forced questions are all admissible in court.  It's important to realize that theattorney fields these questions for the defendant, so direct police interviews still would be refused.Of course, some defendant accused of murdering his wife on March 30 would rather not answer this questionif he was truly at home with her.  But, jurors would know that this incriminating evidence was forcedout.  So, jurors get more information in the end and can stay open to circumstances which allow thedefendant to still be innocent.I'm ultimately looking for alternative justice systems which drop the \"Right to Remain Silent\".  Thereare many cases in the current system where defendants don't even try to give an alibi and this often putsa wasteful burden on investigators.  Are there any such candidate justice systems in other countries? oram I missing something that makes such a system impossible?","answer":"In the US, jurors are not supposed to interpret the conduct of the defendant's attorney as equivalent to testimony by a defendant, and attorney argumentation is explicitly not to be interpreted as testimony.The right to silence is virtually universal in modern legal systems, though in regimes such as North Korea or Iran any nominal legal protections against coerced confessions are disregarded. Historically, coercion has frequently been used to obtain evidence against a defendant, including in UK law a few hundred years ago. Of course, torture is not a necessary aspect of coerced confessions, so an alternative would be summary imprisonment until a confession is rendered.The harm is violation of the rights of the accused. Whether that causes any greater harm to society is really a question for philosophy of politics: legal systems are fairly neutral as to good and bad, they simply operate on baked-in assumptions about good and bad as encoded in systems of legal rights."}

They are prosecuted, leading either to a trial or a plea-bargain. If not prosecuted, charges are dropped.Any country where infringing products are produced or distributed may choose to prosecute criminal infringement.  However, the country where the products are produced and thus where the criminals, or some of them, are located, has an advantage in arresting them and bringing them to trial.

Thus the  the country that could arrest the criminals doesn't, and the country that might want to, can't get hold of them.  International criminal copyright prosecutions are, I believe, rather rare.As a practical matter, almost all copyright enforcement is by private suit, not criminal prosecution.Since each country has jurisdiction on the infringement happen within their country, does the mean the criminal case to be settled in each 179 countries? If that is the case, then don't you think this increases the paperwork?There is no need to settle the case in every, or indeed in any, jurisdiction. Any country where a criminal act occurred may prosecute if it chooses. In practice, few if any will choose to do so.Can matters like this only be settled from only one country (plaintiff or defendant)?No, several countries can bring cases if they so choose. There is no such thing as double jeopardy between separate countries, unless an agreement specifies that there is, and that is not common. Such countries  may need to negotiate over possession of individual defendants - If country A has arrested Joe Thug, country B may not be able to try Joe without the cooperation of country A. Corporate defendants are, of course, always available.  But unless they have an agreement not to do so, multiple countries may legally try Joe or Infringements inc for copyright infringement. Whether they will do so is another matter."}

{"question":"I have two questions I'd like some help on, the answers to which potentially depend on each other.The first is a working definition for a civil wrong (as opposed to a crime). The second is whether all civil wrongs constitute crimes and hence can be regarded as illegal acts.A crime is generally defined as an act or omission that is prohibited by law. Thus, from what I understand, states will have various statutes that are passed by their respective legislatures defining what acts\/omissions constitute crimes in their jurisdiction as well as what their potential punishments will be. For example, California may have a law written in a statute somewhere saying that an individual may not assault someone and that the penalty is no more than 2 years imprisonment etc.Now suppose someone in California bumps into someone else walking on the pavement (accidently) causing the other to fall and injure themselves. In this case, because the action of bumping into someone had no malice aforethought (it was accidental), we could say that the individual has not in fact committed a crime but instead has possibly committed a civil wrong (a tort). If this is the case, are there statutes in each respective state defining exactly what acts and omissions constitute civil wrongs? If there are statutes defining these civil wrongs, surely this would mean that all actions\/omissions defined by statute to be civil wrongs are also in fact prohibited by law ? (since there exists a statute stating that the act\/omission carries with it a potential penalty etc). If this is true, all civil wrongs must necessarily be crimes as well as civil wrongs since they are prohibited by law because a statute declaring a potential penalty for an act\/omission is functionally a prohibition by law.Am I correct in my thinking here? Is it the case that all civil wrongs are necessarily crimes because they constitute actions\/omissions that are prohibited by law (since there exists statutes defining them and their potential penalties)?","answer":"The detailed answer depends on the jurisdiction that you are asking about (e.g. Saudi Arabia, France, US or specifically California): my answer is about the US. You should note that the term crime originally comes from Ancient Greek , which means decision; judgment: the word form is pretty stable, compared to the concepts that it is associated with. When the legal system changes, the referent of crime changes. Some facts about how the words are used are because of historically earlier concepts. At an earlier stage of English law, there was no distinction between crimes and civil wrongs, there were simply wrongs (tort, in French).In contemporary American practice, crime is a sub-type of offense against the government, the other being an infraction (such as a parking ticket). Civil wrong encompasses breaches of contract, breaches of trust, and torts such as trespassing and assault, and have in common that they are wrongs against an individual. If you commit a crime, it is you against the government, and one set of principles is adhered to in deciding guilt. If you commit a civil wrong, it is you against the individual (though it may be that the government acts as the mouthpiece when e.g. the citizens of California have been each wronged), and different principles are adhered to in deciding liability.The distinction can be murky given overlap in certain cases, for example assault is both a crime, as dictated by statutory law and punishable by prison time, and also a tort (sub-type of civil wrong) as recognized at common law (traditionally recognized since the 13th century in England), and passed on to modern America. You can sue a person for the tort of assault, but the government prosecutes you for committing the statutory offense of assault. In the case of a lawsuit over assault, you seek compensation for the harm done do you, you do not seek punishment for an offense against society. That is the function of criminal law, to define the acts which may be punished.Most states in the US have done away with common law crimes, but as far as I know the remnants of common law crime in the US are limited to definitions  punishments are set out in statutory law. An example of common law definitional inheritance is assault under , which summarize the case law that defines assault.As you can see, there is a bright line between crimes and civil wrongs, so it is plainly not the case that all civil wrongs are crimes. A number of civil wrongs are statutorily defined (e.g. copyright infringement), and there is in the US a tendency to statutorily encode the essentials of civil wrongs as well as crimes.You are probably right that crime is generally defined as an act or omission prohibited by law, where generally means by most people, but that is because most people don't have a clear understanding of law, statute and common law. Here in Law SE, we tend to use legal in a very broad sense, meaning would probably be allowed and not incur any sanction by the courts. Copyright infringement is not (necessarily) a crime, but it is prohibited by law, thus prohibited by law is not a good definition of crime.Because of the distinction between crime and infraction, both of which are cases of the individual vs. the government, crime has to be defined in terms of a specific aspect of the statutory law, the punishment. You can be imprisoned for committing a crime, but not for an infraction, such as a parking ticket. In Washington,  is said to be civil in nature.In other words, the distinction is anything but clear."}
{"question":"Say that a city abolishes their police department based on accusations of systematic racism within their police ranks.

Can this person sue the city for not providing in a timely manner the services needed to protect themselves and\/or their property?","answer":"No. The government generally has no duty to protect private citizens from each other. It was different facts but basically the same question in , where the Supreme Court held:  A State's failure to protect an individual against private violence generally does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause, because the Clause imposes no duty on the State to provide members of the general public with adequate protective services. The Clause is phrased as a limitation on the State's power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security; while it forbids the State itself to deprive individuals of life, liberty, and property without due process of law, its language cannot fairly be read to impose an affirmative obligation on the State to ensure that those interests do not come to harm through other means."}
{"question":"I recently bought a product on eBay, that turned out to have been directly bought from the manufacturer with stolen credit card info.A couple months after the purchase, the hardware, which 'calls home' on startup, started displaying a message that read 'product disabled as identified as potentially stolen'.I just checked the terms of sale:ANTI-FRAUD  ...   XXX reserves the right to make contact using details provided, and lock both XXX accounts and hardware.Is this even legal ?This is really the question I'm asking (can't be too specific on stackexchange), but I'd like to provide more context with respect of my own case:The company failed to implement antifraud protection on their website which is often just one optional line of code away (i'm a payment systems programmer). The company accepts payments from Visa, MasterCard, AmericanExpress and Paypal. They all propose anti-fraud filters and offer a zero-liability to the card owner in case of theft. This means the merchant (which turns out to be the company as well in this case) is fully responsible for handling the chargeback the financial institution imposes on the transaction (even if the goods have been sent). In other words (correct me if I'm wrong), the law consider the loss is the value of the goods sent, i.e. that it is not money theft per se, but theft of goods.Disabling the product seems to me like a way to escape their responsibility.Also, for reasons that are too long to explain, I sent back the disabled product to get a refund (was promised so), but now the company, which probably did not want to accept a stolen product to refund\/repair\/re-enable it but did so in the confusion of its shitty many-people-for-one-request kind of support is just silent and I'm still waiting for my refund.What kind of specific threats can I do to force them to perform this refund ?To me the ownership situation (they now own the product they disabled) shows that the theft has factually been transferred onto me, for an error they committed and that I would not have done (it's my job).What kind of offices\/chamber of commerce should I threaten them to reach out to, knowing the company is in Australia and I'm European customer.","answer":"The person getting the item by fraud didn't get any ownership. Therefore when you bought it, you didn't get ownership either. It's still the company's property, and they can do with it what they like (within reason, they wouldn't be allowed to make it blow up in your face).

{"question":"Today (26th of June 2018), the SCOTUS decided that the Sept. 2017 Executive Order banning travelers from several predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States (the 'Travel Ban') does not violate the 1st Amendment of the US constitution. Notably, the SCOTUS declared that the campaign promises that the President made during his campaign rallies of banning all Muslims from entering the country (paraphrasing here) should not be taken into account when deciding whether this order is violating the 1st Amendment.As someone who doesn't live in the USA and isn't a constitutional lawyer, I don't really understand that. If I say 'I'm going to kill the guy who slept with my wife' and 3 days later I jump out from behind a tree and kill him, that's considered premeditation, which increases the severity of the murder charge. However, if the President says 'I'm going to ban all Muslims' and then a year or so later does something to that effect, why is it not taken into account? ","answer":"Because the nations that made the list (which was modified at the time of the SCOTUS hearing) were selected based on their ability to provide the US with documentation for vetting of immigrants (or rather their lack of an ability), not religion, and the courts give the legislature (Congress) and the executive branch (President) wide discretion when matters of security are involved as they are related to foreign relations where the Judiciary have very limited powers.  The specifics of the law which the Executive order modifies do not limit the President beyond a bona fide reason for which the selection was made.The court also ruled that the document contains no mention of any religion specifically or any matters pertaining to religion, and that several nations on the list have no Muslim Majority (they cite 2, but I am only aware of Venezuela being on the list).  Additionally, the nation of Chad was removed from the list after their standards were brought up to scratch.In the original opinion, they did say that the campaign remarks were considered in that they pointed to the plaintiff's standing in the case (you need to show a potential harm is inflicted on you by the law in order to get a court case.  Or in other words, I cannot ask the court to hear a case on rights of a vampire, because I am not a vampire) but found that the request to probe for malice in the minds of the President and his staff was not an area they could tread as there was a good reason for the law and several prominent Muslim Majority nations were not included.Basically, if the government could show that the order was made by some objective standards that neither favored nor disfavored a religion, then it is not a violation of the first amendment. For five of the justices, the government satisfied this requirement.**Note, I am still reading through the ruling... my PDF of it keeps crashing and I lose my place."}
{"question":"On a highway through a rural area, the sign says \"speed limit 70 mph.\" But, the one cop who patrols that stretch of highway pulls over and tickets anyone who goes over 60. In the last 10 years no one has successfully appealed a ticket he's written. From the perspective of the citizen, is the speed limit 70 or 60?Clarifications: The state code says explicitly that only the posted speed limit is enforceable. The cop writes a speed over 70 on the tickets he writes, but whether he does so because his radar gun is miscalibrated, or because he is lying, isn't clear to the citizen.","answer":"Courts, particularly traffic courts, tend to take a police officer's word over that of an accused person. While legally the limit is 70, the driver has very little recourse if the officer claims falsely that the actual speed was over 70. But the deterant effect of a posted limit is lost, since drivers in general have no way to know that Officer O will ticket anyone going over 60.I suppose that driver D, or D's lawyer, could subpoena calibration records of any radar gun or other measuring devise used, and could insist on its being tested. However, unless they had reason to think there was an issue, I wonder if D and D's lawyer would go through that process.Some speed measuring devices print a paper slip showing the date and time along with the reading. If such a device was used that record would be harder to alter.Some cars are now equipped with devices provided by insurance companies that record speeds and other driving info in a secure way to help judge a driver's safety and allow individual rate setting. It might be that the record from such a device would be admissible to show the speed was under the posted limit.But there is a sense in which the law is what the police and the courts enforce. If anyone who drives the road over 60 is cited and must pay, one could say the effective limit there is 60."}

{"question":"My knowledge of law is shallow and only comes from entertainment sources, mainly movies.I was watching some moments of Johny Depp's trial. I noticed that, when an objection is made, the judge responds:\"I will sustain\/overrule the objection\".Isn't that a bit verbose? In movies, I only hear \"Sustained\".","answer":"It doesn't really matter exactly what the judge says as long as it's clear whether the judge is sustaining or overruling the objection.  With that said, in movies you'll rarely see the person asking the question get to respond to the objection, but you'll notice in the trial that happens in most cases.  For example, if one party objects that a question calls for hearsay, the examiner may defend their question by pointing out that the statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, or that it falls into one of the hearsay exceptions.  At that point the judge is responding to both parties and someone else or possibly multiple people have spoken since the objection was originally raised, so she might specify that she's overruling the objection as opposed to just saying overruled, so it just makes it clearer on the record what she's ruling about.It's worth noting as well that she might need to specify which objection she's sustaining if more than one objection is raised.  In this trial both hearsay and relevance objections have been raised at the same time, and the judge might specify that she's sustaining e.g. only relevance.  This can tell the examiner whether they are free to keep going down the same line of questioning with different questions, if the objection sustained was hearsay, or to move to another line of questioning, if the objection sustained was relevance."}

The court directed the jury to find Brayn 'not guilty' for want of evidence and committed the Quaker as a concealer of Felony for refusing an Oath to Witness for the Kingbout the US, the same article states:The original 1787 text of the Constitution of the United States makes three references to an oath or affirmation: In Article I, senators must take a special oath or affirmation to convene as a tribunal for impeachment; in Article II, the president is required to take a specified oath or affirmation before entering office; and in Article VI, all state and federal officials must take an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution. Another reference appears in the Fourth Amendment, which specifies that all warrants must be supported by evidence given under oath or affirmation. of the Federal Rules of Evidence states:Before testifying, a witness must give an oath or affirmation to testify truthfully. It must be in a form designed to impress that duty on the witnesss conscience.and the notes to this rule read:The rule is designed to afford the flexibility required in dealing with religious adults, atheists, conscientious objectors, mental defectives, and children. Affirmation is simply a solemn undertaking to tell the truth; no special verbal formula is required. As is true generally, affirmation is recognized by federal law. Oath includes affirmation, 1 U.S.C. \u00a71; judges and clerks may administer oaths and affirmations, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7459, 953; and affirmations are acceptable in lieu of oaths under Rule 43(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Perjury by a witness is a crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a71621. of the Court Rules of North Dakota reads:(b) Affirmation. A person must be allowed to make an affirmation instead of taking an oath, by substituting the word affirm for the word swear and substituting the phrase under the pains and penalties of perjury for the phrase so help you God.Other stastes have similar rulessIf asked by an official: Do you solemnly swear that ...? one may simply reply I so affirm. This has the same legal effect as I do while not making an oath in a religious sense."}
{"question":"In many cases rule books are copyrighted. For example, the standard set of rules to play chess in the United States is copyrighted. Also, the standard set of rules to play baseball is also copyrighted.This creates a problem in that often these rule books are published in some inconvenient format or size for some uses. Also, players who need to summarize rules for various purposes have the problem of how to do so without getting sued. In many cases organizations would like to display the rules on a poster rather than have them in a book. Once again, there are copyright problems.Rules could be construed as 'information' or 'data' rather than a form of expression, so at some level, to the extent that the rule is 'data' it is not copyrightable. How can organizations that need to republish rules (for example to put them on a poster) be able to do so without violating copyrights?","answer":"Rules' are not copyrightable (they may be patentable): the particular expression of the rules are.To be clear: no one owns the copyright (or the patent) on the rules of chess or (probably<sup>1<\/sup>) baseball - these rules were created prior to the twentieth century and any copyright has long since expired. However, if I sit down and write out my representation of the rules of chess or baseball then I have copyright in that particular expression of them. I can decide how and who can make copies or derivative works from that but I cannot prevent anyone else from writing their own version of the rules.<sup>1<\/sup>The original rules are certainly out of copyright, however, the rules as they are now probably include changes that are subject to copyright."}
{"question":"I want to create a new cryptocurrency as an experiment. Is this legal?My cryptocurrency won't use a blockchain, so laws specifically regulating blockchains might not apply.The system will be completely decentralized. Mining doesn't create any form of control over another user's transactions, so a majority of mining being done by one entity wouldn't be a problem at all other than the possibility of them disrupting operation by just ceasing to mine, so a \"51% attack\" is impossible.","answer":"YesIn general, the default is that it is legal to do anything unless it isn't. That's how cryptocurrencies happened in the first place.Of course, you will have to follow laws that are applicable to cryptocurrencies and not do anything illegal with them or your business."}

{"question":"According to , they're not. I thought this was very interesting considering all the hubbub in the House of Representatives about the FBI agents being or not being whistleblowers.Who Is(nt) Covered?Most executive branch employees, former employees, and applicants fall within the WPAs protections because they are part of the merit system that governs the federal civil service under Title 5 of the U.S. Code. Employees of the Government Publishing Office, aLegislative Branch agency, are also covered. (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(C)).However, some executive branch employees are excluded from the WPAs protections, including (but not limited to):? Political appointees (e.g. federal inspectors general)? Uniformed military service members? Noncareer Senior Executive Service employees? Employees of the 17 different intelligence community elements and the FBI? Members of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps? Officers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Commissioned Corps? Employees of the U.S. Postal Service","answer":"This particular list of excluded branches seems to refer to those who are able to excercise whistleblowing protections through the U.S. Office of Special Counsel.  It does not mean that employees excluded by these rules would be unable to whistleblow at all.  Rather, the government channels through which they are able to seek protection are likely through a different office.  In so far as I can tell, USOSC might restrict the FBI from protection services because they protect employees who go to the Media.   FBI agents often handle classified material which would not be allowed to be disclosed to the media and many intel agency employees are required to submit any documents they intend to publish based off knowledge aquired from their employment for a pre-publishing review to make sure no classified material is leaked, and would thus limit the way the employee could whistleblow.Just because this particular office does not provide protection services to the listed employees, it does not mean there is an agency or department that does provide them (Usually the Office of General Inspector for the particular agency in question.  While they are attached to the agency they cover, they are not within the chain of command of the agency itself and are independent to them.).For that reason, just because the rules that apply to most do not cover FBI Whistle Blowers, it does not mean an FBI employee cannot become a whistle blower.  They just cannot use the services of USOSC in their whistleblowing efforts."}
{"question":"Trials of major terrorists happen quite  often in Europe, but in America, it has taken 2 decades since 9\/11 for the trial of the confessed mastermind to even start in military court. (This is longer than it took from the end of the Holocaust to capture and try Eichmann).Why is it so hard to put someone who has admitted his guilt and where theres lots of evidence on trial?","answer":"A complete analysis would be a major research project, but here is a summary: read  for more details. Jurisdiction has been a significant factor. Initially he was to be tried by a military commission (a panel of active duty officers). Defendant and co-defendants represented themselves, and were skilled in slowing the process. The presiding judge was unexpectedly replaced, and defendants indicated that they wanted to plead guilty, which raised legal questions as to whether the new presiding judge can accept a guilty plea, and also involved competency hearings for some of the defendants.The trial was to be transferred to civilian courts under a new administration in 2009, and the military commission charges were withdrawn. There was a large political stink about holding the trial in New York, and a further complication was that the defendants' lawyers were not allowed to travel to Cuba to consult with their clients (I assume it's clear why that's a problem). Laws relating to  and using federal funds to transfer detainees from that facility were passed, so the matter was transferred back to a military commission, and in May 2012 a military trial started. The is a long set of issues regarding e.g. the speakers being cut off, female guards, motions to recuse, access to information that has been classified, and then finally a trial date just in time for COVID-19, but it was restarted a few days ago."}

{"question":"A certain University in New Jersey is holding a conference and organising an afternoon of excursions and leisure activities. It requires that participants sign a waiver containing the clause (emphasis mine):In exchange for {UNIVERSITY}s grant of permission for Participant to participate as a registered Conference Participant in an excursion or activity, for himself or herself, his or her parents, guardians, heirs, assigns, agents, and all those in privity with Participant, do hereby release, waive, discharge, and covenant not to sue {UNIVERSITY}, its trustees, officers, employees, and agents from liability from any and all claims, including negligence, personal injury, accidents, assaults, kidnappings, or illnesses (including death) and property or economic loss related to or arising from, but not limited to, participation in the Seminar[sic].and also:I have read this waiver of liability and assumption of risk agreement, fully understand its terms, and understand that I am giving up substantial rights, including releasing the University from all liability related to or arising out of the Conference excursion or activity. I acknowledge that I was provided this document with sufficient time to consider its provisions, ask questions and to seek review of it counsel[sic]. I am signing the agreement fully and voluntarily, and intend by my signature to be a complete and unconditional release of all liability to the greatest extent allowed by law.It isn't realistic for me to seek professional legal advice on a waiver for  an afternoon's excursion. To what extent does NJ law allow an institution to demand a waiver from the negligence of itself or its agents?","answer":"The University is probably entitled to put a term like this in its contract. In general, one can waive in advance, liability for negligence, but not gross negligence, willful and wanton misconduct, reckless  conduct, or intentional conduct, from the person seeking the waiver. The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the validity of these clauses in the case of  (August 5, 2010), which involved a negligence waiver in a contract with a private gym.Also, since this is conditions on an afternoon of fun activities, rather than something mandatory or necessary, this waiver does not appear to be conditioned on giving up a substantial thing to which you are otherwise entitled. If the waiver were conditions upon something which you had an unconditional right to (e.g. a public high school education), it might not be valid because it would not be supported by valid consideration. In contrast, here, you get the right to participate in something fun, which you did not have an unconditional right to have, in exchange for the liability waiver."}
{"question":"Can the President of the United States be impeached for endangering the security of the state? 'Endangering the security of the state' defined as leaking or telling sensitive information to other countries or third parties, abuse of power in a way harmful or destructive to the Judicial or Legislative branches of the government and\/or beneficial to other countries, or degradation of the defensive military in a way directly or indirectly harmful to the security of the United States.","answer":"Under Art I Sect 4 of the Constitution, the President 'shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors'. There is no existing crime or misdemeanor 'Endangering the security of the state'. However, in the case of Clinton's impeachment,  specify a number of acts which are not statutory crimes \/ misdemeanors. Since the Constitution speaks in general terms about the grounds for impeachment, such an impeachment would not be clearly unconstitutional. It is likewise not clearly constitutional. There is no legal precedent that tells us how the Supreme Court would interpret the power of the House to impeach, in particular whether it would be unconstitutional to impeach a president for 'abuse of power in a way harmful or destructive to the Judicial or Legislative branches of the government and\/or beneficial to other countries, or degradation of the defensive military in a way directly or indirectly harmful to the security of the United States'.Since the Constitution does not clearly prohibit such an impeachment, it is unlikely that SCOTUS would rule that such an impeachment is unconstitutional, although it has the theoretical power to so rule. In light of the fact that Article 1, Section 2, Clause 5 states 'The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment', and the fact that in  it was held that the Senate's decision to convict and remove that judge based on the analogous 'sole power' clause for trials, there is no realistic chance that the courts would review any aspect of the impeachment process."}

They seem to be plain reproductions, unaltered in any way.I can find U.S. copyright law, but nothing about using antique mass-market images created in Britain. Nor any information about U.S.-British mutual copyright agreements that focus on commercial images.Thank you.","answer":"Copyright always is globalWhen you make a new work, you gain copyright everywhere the  was signed, to the degree that country provides.

As a result, we have to look back...

However, it is more narrow. Depending on the artistic choices of the photographs, and who made the digital copy, copyright might or might not apply. If copyright applies, then only in the artistic choices of the photographer, e.g. specific lighting or how the pieces are mounted, a text belonging to the picture... Anything that adds to the original work has its own copyright.As a reasonably safe example: the library of Congress and its employees would not hold copyright in a digital copy, as they are US government actors. Those copies are Public Domain.It looks entirely different in museums: the  is copyrighted, despite the items in it being at times thousands of years old. Those pictures are contextualized in the catalog of the collection with notes and such. The MET has a copyright on the collection and its texts.But... as long as the photos are just mere reproductions with no artistic input no new copyright was created."}
{"question":"If you're writing a patent application does the patent need to be specific enough to avoid ambiguity, but not so specific that it locks you into a pinhole sized area (example: define a type of device, or software specs)?","answer":"A  requires detailed public exposure of the invention: that's what you give the state in return for your monopoly rights.

{"question":"If the rights or wrongs of abortion are a judicial matter rather than political, central to it would seem to be the question of what defines a \"person\".Critical to the idea that abortion should be illegal seems to be that a foetus is defined as a person, and is entitled to all the rights etc as such.Civil law (including commercial law, in the United States and all English-speaking jurisdictions) has its own definitions of persona which is in some ways more extensive and in others less so than in criminal law. For example legally constituted companies, or governmental bodies etc have legal personality and can sue or be sued.But is there ANY branch of the law, in any country of which subscribers may be aware - where a foetus is given legal personality separate to that of the mother?For example, I could leave money in my will to my 5 year-old granddaughter, and, should she not survive me, - to \"any of her ( currently unborn) issue\". That would not mean that the unborn issue at the time of writing the will had legal personality - but they would acquire it at birth. But is there any country where they might acquire it at e.g. conception? The question is not as irrelevant as it might sound, since if a foetus, for example, inherited money, but did not survive birth - would the money in question become part of a separate estate in their name, and dealt with appropriately, under laws of intestacy. Does anyone know of any country where that, for example, might be the case?","answer":"The law isnt just concerned with peopleAnimal welfare laws, for example, impose obligations on people to do or refrain from doing things for the benefit of animals who are clearly not people.Pro- or anti-abortion law could be made with or without recognising a foetus as a person. of laws that give legal status to a foetusIn  you can murder a foetus."}
{"question":"I'm trying to wrap my head around the :I never lived thereI never traveled thereI had no company thereBut all I worked for now belongs to the U.S.Now I came across a news item on the German portal  that says Kim Dotcom is about to be handed over to the U.S. authorities by a N.Z. court.Now I am wondering: He never had any company in the U.S., also he claims to never having been or lived there. Is it even possible to be prosecuted unter U.S. law? It sounds a bit weird to me. Also, is it possible to get extradicted to a country you never have been to?Personally, to me the scary part is: Do I need to make sure I do not break any laws in any country of the world in the future, not only in the country I live? Or is this a difficult question to answer because the accusations against him are related to internet business?","answer":"Yes.Kim Dotcom is alleged to have committed a crime against US law. The US requested his arrest by NZ authorities with whom they have an extradition treaty. He has now had his extradition hearing and the NZ court is satisfied that, under NZ law, he should be extradited to face those charges.You do not have to be a citizen of a country to offend its laws. You do not have to be located within its borders.For example, if you rob a US bank over the internet you are liable to prosecution in the US no matter where you are in the world.

{"question":"Two standards that I've heard of are 'compelling' evidence, and 'reasonable indication.' Apparently, they may be used to defend certain actions where the level of proof is less than 50-50 but 'non-trivial.' How, for example, can evidence be 'compelling' while being 'less likely than not?'","answer":"The standard of proof required to survive a motion to dismiss is very low.The factual (not legal) assertions of the plaintiff are assumed to be true, and the case is dismissed if the defense shows that even when the plaintiff is given that benefit, the assumed facts don't establish the case.This standard is somtimes referred to as 'sufficiency of the claims'."}
{"question":"A book published in 1875 is in the public domain.A scan of it possibly being copyrightable in certain jurisdictions by \"sweat of the brow\" logic is not copyrightable in every jurisdiction.But if there was a simple contract written and agreed to, that stated that the person being given a PDF or JPEG copy of the 1875 book was being given these files to do with what they wished, with the caveat being they couldn't reproduce them in whole or substantial part, or otherwise proliferate the scans to others (whether for free or profit, whether citing the scanning source or otherwise)...Would that contract be able to stand up in a court of law (namely US), that while the images are of a book in the public domain, and not copyrightable by \"sweat of the brow\" and thus outside of copyright entirely, and in theory one could do with them whatever one wanted...if there was a contract whereby one person agreed NOT to exercise the right of public domain protection, is that valid?","answer":"Sort ofA copyright suit would fail because, as you say, there is no copyright.However, a suit for breach of contract would likely succeed. You promised not to do something and then you did it. That is a clear breach of the contract you entered and would entitle the other party to sue for damages. Admittedly, such damages are likely to be nominal at best because no real loss has been suffered but the suit would probably succeed."}
{"question":"This is more of a theoretical question, but have been having discussions with coworkers regarding this and cannot come to a conclusion. With the passing of article 13 in the EU, if a site chooses to simply block users from within the EU from accessing their site (I'm aware this can be bypassed with vpns and whatnot), can anything be enforced regarding possibly 'copyrighted' content? If a site had few enough European visitors, the cost of having to filter out everything may far outweigh the drop in traffic. It may be to early in the game to know yet, I'm unaware of the finer details of said article but have a generalized understanding of it.Note: I've tagged with both EU and US because I'm currently located and host my sites in the US. Unsure if the EU even has legal authority over what I serve here.To summarise my question: Does the EU have any legal power over my site if I take reasonable steps to block web clients from within the EU?","answer":"I try to reply here very briefly from my personal experience.  Article 13 (now Article 17)  is harmonization of copyright law, which is part of the civil law. (No EU will not go after you.) It is very difficult to go through a civil dispute even in a different member state of the EU. Only in very huge cases are considered international disputes effective. The content of Article 17 is very vague 'effective and proportionate measures', 'best efforts' etc. so there is a small chance to be successful. Harmonization of copyright laws has to be implemented in the member states of the EU. In other words, if you have no property in the EU, they can not enforce the law on you. I would not consider ' Blocking EU users' as effective because copyright can be infringed even if a person outside of the EU has unauthorized access to the author's work. From my perspective there are two sides:You have to be in line objectively with Article 17 to not to be held responsible for violation of copyright otherwise it can be enforced in a civil proceeding, buteven if the other party win the case, enforceability is very low if you are resident outside of the EU."}
{"question":"Say a new company, NewCo, wants to use the name of their competition, BigCo, in their tag line without BigCo's permission. Something like:NewCo  (Like BigCo, only newer)Is this legal? Is it fair use? Or there some violation of federal trademark law or some other IP statute or regulation? Does the content of the tag line matter given that it's all \"puffery\" anyway? Or would marketplace confusion become an issue if they said something like, say, \"NewCo  the newer version of BigCo.\"","answer":"It really depends how the tag line is presented.   For example, BigCo may be an unregistrered (TM) or a Registered Trademark (R), but big co is not a registered mark. So if NewCo could have an actor say your tag line in all spoken advertisements and then when served a trademark dispute claim You thought we said 'BigCo?  We said 'big co'.   In print they could say:NewCo - (Like [a] big co, only newer).The article a is added so that it grammatically flows but the argument is that NewCo is saying they are big corperation or company (abbreviated co) but are newer.   BigCo may be a subset of big corperations, but so is GiantCo and NovaCo, which are not direct competition. In New Co's market.Another play is to move around word or refernce concepts so that there is a generic boast but any consumer would know the dig is directed a competators.  For example, say McDonalds and Burger King release the following two claims in their ads:McDonald's:  Come to McDonald's, the true king of burgers.Burger King:  Come to Burger King, where we never clown around with our customers.In both cases, the statements use generic terms to poke fun at their competator's brand without saying the name directly.  Everyone knows that Burger King's mascot is a king of burgers while McDonald's mascot is a clown, and that the jabs are invoking claims but the ads aren't directly featuring either company's trademarks.   Here this is puffery as both claims are subjective in the eyes of a consumer.  It's highly unlikely that either company would be in any legal challenge.  Also because we all know Wendy's is the true sass queen of the fast food burger joints... and their popular Where's the Beef? ad campaign featured a fictional competator which advertised a hamburger with a large bun and a comically small patty and cheese slice.  At the time, McDonald's (and Burger King) focused strongly on the bun of their product with terms describing it as Big and Fluffy as it was assumed the beef was going to be in the bun.  The point was summed up in the Wendy's commercial when the competator was shown to have a single golden arch as it's logo, evoking similar images to McDonald's famous logo.  The campaign was so sucessful that 1984's presidential campaign would see the slogan adopted by Walter Mondale during the primaries, and the actress who played the old lady asking the question would feature in a Prego (spaghetti sause) commercial which advertised it's beef blend with her saying I've found it!  Another example of parody and word play being used is how you answer the question:  Which company sells batteries with a  toy pink bunny beating a drum that lasts forever because of the battery?  If you're in the United States, you would say Energizer.  In Europe the answer is Duracell.  The Energizer Bunny was a parody of an iconic Duracell Bunny which was used 15 years previous.  Despite the campaign concluding, Duracell sued but settled for splitting the trademark so Energizer would have the trademark in the US and Duracell would have it everywhere else.  Part of the reason the case didn't go to trial was Duracell's lapse of use of the character and several differneces:  Energizer's character wore prominant sunglasses, sandles, and was a lone individual while Duracell's bunnies wore a yellow shirt and were a species (It's THE one and only Energizer Bunny in all commercials vs. A group of (or one of a group of) several Duracell Bunnies in all commercial).Another case is say NewCo releases an ad where it states that in a recenty trade magazine, NewCo's products were found to be more Modern than BigCo's products and then mad your slogan.  Here, it's acceptable because they cite an trade source that did a side by side comparison between to products on objective merits (or customer subjective  preference) and used the findings.  One famous campaign of this nature is The Pepsi Challenge which feature a single sip blind taste test where the customers overwhelmingly chose the product revealed to be Pepsi over Coca-Cola (Coke).  The ad worked because when drinking a sip, consumers would typically prefer a sweeter flavor, which Pepsi had over Coke..  However, if allowed to consume the whole can, Coke would bring in a slightly better result.  Pepsi could set up anywhere and give the test, film it, cut the examples of customers choosing coke, and run the ad with their commentator's product displayed because they could not show the test results without a fair use of their competitor's product.  Coke did not take this lying down and did their own counter marketing digs, such as releasing a campaign button which read I selected Coke in the Pepsi Challenge. (Pepsi Challenge was a trade mark for the campaign but Coke could use it because they were advertising the people who were proud because they made the right choice in Coke's view.   As it was a study, Coke could tout the results, including the pride of their loyal customers who didn't take the bait.)   If BigCo was established in 1887 and NewCo was established in 2007, and they featured the same product, then your above slogan has an objective statement of fact and is not puffery.  Furthermore, while objective, it would not necessarily be damaging as BigCo can counter that 100 years of experience in the market and nostailgic pleas could counter the illusion of moderness.  BigCo would be better served by pointing out that you should trust the time tested BigCo over some young upstart like NewCo than actually suing NewCo, who could not only have a valid defense but spin the PR as BigCo being so afraid of a competitor that they would resort in uncompetative practices to get rid of competition.  (Suing a company out of Buisness is not competitive as opposed to product sales.  BigCo would only sue a smaller new company if it feared the new company would actually be able to take a big bight out of their market share... and this is over a correctly stated 120 year age difference between the two...   which would imply BigCo is old and rigid while NewCo is hip and down with the kids)."}
{"question":"Apparently, (soon-former) US President Donald Trump's name  on the stimulus checks sent out last year.I guess this is a late question to ask, but - how can this be legal? It makes it appears as though it is a personal gesture by Trump rather than a federal state action, which if anything is credited to the congress. Obviously it has a significant (and perhaps huge) effect on people's personal support for Trump as a candidate if \"he sent them checks\".Is this kind of practice really not forbidden by some law or election-related regulation?","answer":"It is common place for major official actions, not just checks but also, for example, governmental buildings, to note the politicians who implemented law or enacted them at the time. This practice is not forbidden by any law or election-related regulation.There is a strong political norm as a matter of political etiquette that checks from the government be signed by a senior official in the Treasury department or a state and local equivalent, such as the Secretary of Treasury, the Comptroller of the Currency, or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service, rather than the President, Governor, or Mayor. But no one would have legal standing to challenge a violation of this political norm in court, because a person receiving a check naming the President as the signer has not suffered an actual injury."}
{"question":"Several months ago I signed a contract to lease an apartment in Utah, USA and took up residence in the said apartment. The contract was stated explicitly to run through August 25th. This is clearly and unambiguously stated in writing.I signed this contract and so did the landlords.However, now the landlord is telling me that this was a typo and that it should have said August 14th. I was notified of this on August 6. They are threatening to fine me or send collections after me if I do not vacate the apartment by noon on the 14th of August.The only problem is that I have employment in this city until August 19th. I would need to live in my car for five days if they kick me out.I am not overly concerned about them coming after me, as I do not believe that the case law backs them up here. However, I felt it best to get the legal opinion of the Internet on the matter. Do I have a firm case to stand on if they were to pursue legal or financial action against me? Are there specific cases or statutory considerations that you are aware of that provide legal precedent in this type of case?  ","answer":"I will not speak to your specific situation. I am unfamiliar with the jurisdiction and real estate contracts are one of the most highly regulated contracts so local statutes may override common law.In general, the terms of a contract are what the parties agree; the written document is not the contract - it is evidence of the contract.In a case where the parties agree that the written version is wrong then the written version is wrong. Where the parties disagree that the written version is wrong (or agree that it is wrong but disagree as to how) then each will need to provide evidence to support their position. A signed written contract that supports one parties position is extremely strong evidence! The other party would need to provide some overwhelming evidence to trump this.The general position that the courts take is that the written contract accurately documents the agreement unless someone can prove that it doesn't."}
{"question":"We got into an interesting debate at work today after someone joked that a prostitute would be cheaper than dating someone.  The crutch of the debate was whether Federal employees or military could use a prostitute if they went to Las Vegas.Prostitution is legal in certain parts of LV.  However, the debate was whether there was a Federal law that would prohibit travelling to another state for the express purpose of using a prostitute.  At least one person suggested it was illegal due to human trafficking's laws, though I'm not convinced that is accurate.So, could a Federal employee legally travel to LV with the intent of using a prostitute there?  As a related question is it possible that it's legal, i.e. I won't end up in jail, but would be grounds for termination from Federal employment; though I realize the latter question may be more policy than a legal question.","answer":"First of all, contrary to popular legend, it is not legal for anyone regardless of employer to solicite prostitution in Las Vegas.   While Prostitution is Legal in Nevada, Clark County, the county in which Las Vegas is located, has made prostitution illegal.  So the Federal Employee is violating the law if he\/she does this in Las Vegas specifically.  You also can't do it in Reno (it's illegal in Washoe County) and the nearby independent city of Carson City (Nevada State Capital).  In fact, the law only permits counties with a population of 70,000 or less to do it per county law.  And before you ask, you can't go to Rachel, Nevada (closest settlement to Area 51) for some extraterrestrial ladies of the night as well as Lincoln County, while qualifying for legalized prostitution with a total population of , prohibits it.  Of the 16 counties in Nevada, only 10 allow prostitution, all of which must be done through regulated licensed brothels only.  Even then, only 8 counties have at least one active brothel in operation.Despite this, the U.S. laws against Sex Tourism only allow for prosecution of individuals who travel to foreign nations to engage in sex with a minor (under 18 years old) regardless of that nation's laws.  Federal policy also prohibits all federal agents from foreign travel for these purposes regardless of age of the prostitute.   In addition, the states of Hawaii, Missouri, and Washington make it illegal for travel agencies to promote sex tourism in the state (again regardless of age) but are not able to penalize individuals who travel for such purposes (since the federal government regulates interstate and international commerce, this is their job.)."}

So if a line of cars were at both stop signs, and all cars wanted to make the same conflicting turns, they would alternate.If the opposing cars stop at the same time then the one turning right has the right of way.

{"question":"Modern browsers offer the ability to edit the HTML source of a page while viewing it; for instance, on Firefox, with right click - inspect element - right click on the line highlighted in blue - edit as HTML, I can modify any text appearing in any web page.What happens if I alter the text of a click-through license in this way before clicking 'OK'? One could argue that this is equivalent to striking out a clause from a contract before signing it; however, the other party typically has no way to figure out that it has happened, because it is a modification that I make only on my web browser, and the text of the page is usually not sent back to the server together with the button click.What would be the legal validity of this behaviour? Suppose, for instance, that I get a witness to confirm that I clicked 'I agree' on a modified page and not on the original one. You may assume that all parties are in the US, for simplicity.","answer":"  What would be the legal validity of this behaviour?Your changes to the browser source of the website contract or license of Terms of Service (TOS) - essentially a 'click-wrap' license - before agreeing to it means nothing in a legal sense, other than to void the contract.The other party (the website) can't possibly agree to those contract changes without them being submitted as contractual changes and agreeing to them, if they did agree to them. That's basic contract law.That website TOS probably has a clause that says that if you don't agree to the TOS in full, as written, without modifications, you can't use the website. And the TOS may also say that they reserve the right to prevent you from using the site by closing your account or even blocking your access.Your 'witness' to the contract changes is meaningless, as your witness is not a party to the contract. And any witness to the fact that you have changed the terms of the TOS before agreeing to it would work against you in a civil proceeding as proof of your attempt at modifying the contract."}
{"question":"I'm asking in general and also specifically in the example I'm going to show. In my country, international treaties have constitutional level since 1994, which means a violation of an international treaty is a violation of the constitution. For example, Argentina signed the declaration of human rights, so if a law violates a human right here, it's violating the constitution. How is this in United States? Does violating an international treaty have any legal consequence in United States?","answer":"For the US, violating the obligations of a treaty (for the purposes of international law) is not the same as a violation of the US constitution (for the purposes of domestic US law). The US Constitution is higher than treaties, and if a treaty is in conflict with the constitution, courts will rule the treaty null and void for the purposes of US law. See the Supreme Court decision in Reid v. Covert (1957). In addition, treaties do not have a privileged position over regular federal law, and simple acts of Congress can amend or repeal treaties for the purposes of US law. See the Supreme Court decision in the Head Money Cases (1884). In these cases, other countries may still regard the US to still be bound by the obligations of the treaty, even though the US may no longer be following the domestic law obligations, and thus the US may be violating the treaty from the perspective of international law.Even if a treaty has not been ruled unconstitutional and has not been amended by Congress, a violation of it might still not be a violation of US law. For example, Article 33 of the Refugee Convention (which is binding on the US because it's a party to the Refugee Protocol) prevents countries from returning refugees to a country where they are persecuted. But the US government has taken the  Congressional Research Service report goes into detail about the issues surrounding the impact of treaties on US law."}

{"question":"(Apologies in advance for the lengthy epistle)Background:A colleague is planning to launch a social media and forum website which will appeal to a relatively narrow audience.  For the sake of discussion, I've compared it to an online dating website. During a technical review, I noted he intends to block the entire EU due to GDPR regulation, as other major media outlets (presumably following legal advice) have taken the same approach.Personally, I've always detested blanket-bans as they inhibit the open and collaborative nature of the Internet. I sought for a solution that would allow EU users to knowingly waive their GDPR rights in order to use a site that was not necessarily GDPR compliant. See In response to the question, @DavidSiegel pointed out a  map which depicted five US states that also currently have active GDPR-like data privacy laws.  Additionally, there are apparently a handful of other states that are working to introduce similar laws which are expected to possibly be active by 2023.@DavidMulder noted that other countries like Japan, Canada, Brazil, Israel, Kenya, Argentina [and probably many others] also have their own data privacy legislation.All this information was helpful, but it ultimately led my colleague to drastically expand his geoblock ranges to encompass these additional states and countries. Ugh!Changing gears, I myself am also an engineer who has several services and websites I would someday like to share with the world. Consequently, this discussion around GDPR\/CCPA has piqued my interest to some degree.So now that you have an overview of the background...on toThe question:Why is the onus for adhering to privacy directives (e.g. GDPR, CCPA, etc.) on a host and not the user?If I create a website and make it available to the Internet, anyone in the world can theoretically access it. From EU users, to Iran users, to California users.  If my server resides in New York City, USA, I would expect that the laws of the USA, New York State, and New York City apply to that server.I'm not a lawyer by any stretch of the imagination, but many articles I've reviewed seem to suggest that my server (in NYC, USA) would be responsible for adhering to GDPR if someone in the EU connected to it and provided so called PII. Likewise, if someone in California connected to my server in (NYC, USA) and provided personal info, the server must adhere to California's CCPA law.The preceding paragraph is the crux of my concern.  If my NYC server doesn't actually need to care about who is connecting from where or what data they provide, this entire question I posed is moot\/there is no concern.However, if my server must be concerned about every single privacy law legislation in existence (GDPR, CCPA, California Prop24, Colorado SB 190, Connecticut SB 6, Virginia SB 1392, Utah SB 227, and surely more to come in the US) plus Japan, Canada, Brazil, Israel, Kenya, Argentina and forthcoming privacy laws legislation from other countries (and\/or their states?)...Well hopefully, you see what I'm getting at. If it's required to support this plethora of ever increasing and changing legislation, it effectively prevents law abiding individuals or small businesses from providing interactive websites or services -- we simply just don't have the time, legal team, or financial resources that large corporations do.  If this is the case, then the Internet's future does not look very bright to me.Assuming your answer is GDPR\/CCPA\/XYZ compliance is required for my NYC server, how does that mandate even bear any weight? The US is a sovereign nation, not a part of EU.  Even though California is a part of the US, it's not part of New York so I would expect that only servers operating within California would be required to adhere to CCPA. If\/when New York State creates privacy legislation, then my NYC server would be subject to it. And Iran, only servers in Iran would be expected to follow Iran's mandate.  Etc., etc.  This is the only approach I can fathom that makes any sense when dealing with multiple disparate legal jurisdictions.While I suspect (and would hope) there is a significant amount of overlap between the privacy legislation from all these legal jurisdictions, there doesn't have to be.  Some jurisdictions may change their legislation more than others, add unique requirements, etc.I don't want anyone to think that I'm against data protection or privacy; I've always been a strong technical proponent for both.But we must ensure that individuals and small businesses can still operate in a global connected environment without having to blacklist the world for fear they don't comply with one of the ever fluctuating policies for country XYZ.Personally I think a site that is claiming GDPR\/CCPA\/XYZ compliance should clearly disclose it to users when they visit the site and then leave it up to the user to decide whether or not they will use the site. (I always assumed that was the entire point of the barrage of popups that routinely appear when visiting a website?)Instead of burdening every service with the requirement to support every piece of privacy legislation in existence from where it's users may visit (again, how is that even legal to enforce in sovereign nations like the US?), it would be much better to do things the usual way of requiring the user to take personal responsibility for the sites that they access.Reflect back on how things transitioned for web browser connections: In the old days, you visited a web server and it was always an unencrypted HTTP connection. Anyone between your computer and the server could read or change anything you sent or received. Later, SSL and then TLS encryption was added to scramble all data when in transit.  Today, when you visit a site, popular browsers displays a padlock icon for sites that using a secure connection and a warning is first displayed if you try to access an older site that isn't setup to use encryption. Moreover, you can verify the site's certificate to ensure it matches the entity that you expect to be communicating with (e.g. your financial institution, business, etc.)  The system isn't perfect, but it allows users to be much more confident that their sensitive information (e.g. a credit card number, passwords, government id numbers, PII\/whatever you want to call it) won't be stolen in transit over the internet, while still allowing older non-encrypted sites to be usable.Something similar could be setup to support all these different privacy legislations. If the site doesn't support whatever privacy legislation you desire, then choose not to use the site. (Again, I believe this is what all the popups you see when first visiting a website are trying to do.)  Large businesses will quickly adapt to support whatever legislation you want because they don't want to lose sales.  Sites that aren't profit driven (or generate very low profits) likely won't care and they'll just accept that the user doesn't want to use their site and will use an alternative instead.In summary, I'm really tired of reading about privacy legislation.  Attempting to foist privacy legislation on services external to the legal entity that created them is going to destroy individual and small business innovation, lead to more monopolies and ultimately be bad for everyone.While it is important to protect PII information, all it takes is a single data compromise for it to be exposed.  Large corporations routinely experience data breaches.  Being GDPR\/CCPA\/XYZ compliant does not mitigate the problem of protecting PII.Thanks in advance to all who share what they know about this. Looking forward to reading everyone's feedback.","answer":"For the same reason that states require doctors to be licensedSurely, if I want an unqualified, unlicensed surgeon (or a person that says theyre a surgeon) to crack open my cranium and poke my brain, thats up to me?There is no doubt that requiring people to attend medical school for half a decade and then spending a similar period as an intern and a resident is a large barrier to entry compared to handing high school graduates a scalpel and a bone saw and telling them to learn on the job.The same applies to engineers, lawyers, plumbers, electricians, builders etc. I mean if a building falls down because the engineer or builder didnt know what they were doing, it cant kill that many people, can it?Even drivers for that matter - its a large cost to individuals and businesses to learn to drive, pass a test, maintain a license and a relatively clean record, register a car, keep it roadworthy etc. Surely it would be simpler to let anyone drive anything and if they cause someone harm, like dying, for that individual to seek redress through the courts?Well, theres a reason why states mandate things and its economic rather than legal.When people dont trust each other transaction costs go up. These costs are usually borne by the consumer as the suppliers engage in a race to the bottom - whoever provides the worst service at the lowest cost wins. Further, these costs are borne unevenly - most consumers are fine, some are very severely damaged; possibly with no real redress.By imposing minimum standards, the state places these costs in the hands of the people who are best positioned to manage them - the supplier. Once a user has given their data to the supplier they have no control over it. Therefore the economical optimal solution to maximize economy-wide output is to make the supplier legally responsible for managing the data in accordance with minimum standards.ExtraterritorialityIn an ideal world, there would be universal privacy standards. There would also be universal standards for training doctors and engineers. But there arent.Therefore, countries and states impose their own standards on organizations that operate within their jurisdiction. The threshold for the GDPR (and most other privacy laws) is whether you are targeting users within their jurisdiction. If so, they have the power under international law to assert sovereignty even if you are located elsewhere.A state has power where it says it has power. Otherwise, you could plan a terrorist attack on the USA from the UK and not have to fear prosecution. Thats what extradition treaties and honoring other nations civil judgements is all about.A website or similar platform operates in each and every jurisdiction it is accessible from. Like a surgeon with unlimited plane tickets. Therefore, it must comply with the law in each and every jurisdiction its operating in. Countries have adopted one of 2 solutions - Chinas is to simply block all external sites, everyone else has said you can operate here but you have to follow our rules, just like every other business has to.Now, you may not like this but there is no doubt they have the legal power to do it."}

{"question":"DP = Discriminated PersonI've spent the last several years helping multiple Silicon Valley, Austin and other tech companies discriminate against qualified persons of color, females, and the disabled. I'm tired of it. I want to blow the whistle, but what should I watch out for? Not saying I'm proud of it, but I want to blow the whistle on how it was done. Here are some of the ways I helped do this:Create 'unicorn' job listings that very few people can actually fill. When a DP applicant applies and is not able to fulfill the strict job requirements, pass them up. However, when a non-DP applicant applies with a satisfactory level of experience and skills, take them.In the event that a DP applicant matches a unicorn role (rare), interview them and require senior-level skills in multiple other disciplines for the role.Ensure that the DP applicant is asked lots of obscure questions unrelated to the job. If they fail on a single question, it's enough to disqualify them from the process.Punish DP candidates who make it through the hiring wall by giving them unrealistic goals and deadlines, and holding them to a much higher standard than everyone else. Usually they'll get fed up and quit, but if they don't we can fire them for 'unsatisfactory performance.' Never had an issue with constructive dismissals because we stack the 'evidence' against them from the beginning. Many times we outright fabricate it.If they somehow get past this, we just deny them promotions for various reasons.Create strict 'culture fit' rules that DP applicants generally can't fit into, and pass them up based on 'not a cultural fit' reasons.These controls basically ensure DP applicants never really get a chance, and if they do, everything is stacked against them. It helps the companies save lots of money on accommodations, and prevents a significant amount of lawsuits.I've helped successfully defend against multiple EEOC lawsuits simply by showing the candidate was not qualified for the position, or didn't perform their job well enough. Either we stack the evidence against them from the beginning, or outright fabricate it.","answer":"You need to talk to a lawyer.There are lots of whistleblower laws that could be implicated by the course of conduct you're talking about, but they are not always as robust as the average person might expect.

{"question":"The first defining condition for hearsay under Federal Rules of Evidence 801(c)(1) is that it is a statement which the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing. As I understand it, this means that the statement (testimony) 'I saw Jones stab Smith' offered by a witness is not hearsay, because the statement is made by the declarant at the current trial. This is why people can testify to what they observed.But even though the testimony 'Jones said 'I stabbed Smith'' would be a statement made by a declarant at the current trial, it also includes the statement 'I stabbed Smith', and that statement was not made by the declarant at the current trial. Thus the overall statement introduces a second statement. Assuming that this statement is made at the trial to prove that Jones stabbed Smith, the testimony would therefore be hearsay. Furthermore, if Jones were to testify about himself that I said that I stabbed Smith, that too would be hearsay (although that statement too is made by the declarant, it was not made at the current trial).There are various subsequent exceptions where statements are then positively defined as 'not hearsay', which I dont want to pursue at the moment. My question is whether my characterization of the fundamental definition of hearsay is correct (and if not, why not, with case citations especially appreciated). For the sake of discussion, assume this is somewhere in the US.(My ultimate goal is to understand 'adoptive admissions').","answer":"I think your basic understanding is correct.  Hearsay is any (a) out-of-court statement (b) offered for its truth.  See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).  That's what you have in the second paragraph of your question.But a law professor might take issue with the way you describe hearsay exceptions.  Rule 801(d) creates hearsay 'exemptions' which are, by definition, non-hearsay.  On the other hand, Rules 803 and 804 carve out hearsay 'exceptions,' which are in fact hearsay statements, but which are deemed admissible due to some supposed trustworthiness.  Statements that are properly admitted under Rules 803 and 804 are hearsay, but they are admissible hearsay.  I never saw the rationale behind this exemption-exception distinction, and I think the exemptions are really just exceptions, but that's what the state of the law is.To answer the question, 'how can testimony not be hearsay,' it could be (a) an in-court assertion, (b) not offered for its truth, or (c) definitionally 'not hearsay' under Rule 801(d)."}
{"question":"Insurance typically follows the car and not the driver, which means other licensed drivers can use your car. However, and I'm aware this is policy dependent, insurers generally do not allow for repeated use of a car by other drivers, especially if they live in the same household without being added to the policy. However, imagine a scenario where one is the title holder and allows someone else that has been added to the policy to use a car. However, the person added to the policy lives with someone else and repeatedly allows that person to use the car against your wishes, which means the insurance company could potentially deny coverage. Can you be held liable if the person (roommate) not on the policy gets in an accident even if the person that is on the policy didn't honor your request (you are the title holder)? In such a situation, should one retake possession of the car in order to avoid liability issues?  ","answer":"First of all I am goingn to assume a US-basis, becauae the question seems to describe a US-based understanding.

All of that said, it depends what you mean by 'Can you be held liable'. Unless you know that the person driving your car without your permission is a generally unsafe driver, such that it would be negligent to allow that person to drive at all, the owner of the car would not normally be liable for damage to other parties by a person driving the owner's car, particularly one who does so without permission. If the driver is in fact unsafe, and the owner knows that the unsafe person is in fact using the owner's car with some frequency, then it might be negligent  not to take reasonable steps to stop this.However, if the unauthorized driver is in fact driving the car with some frequency and the owner knows this and does not take steps to stop it, nor to inform the insurance company, then the company might decline coverage if this person was involved in an accident, leaving the owner with uninsured damage to his\/her property. The driver would legally be liable, but if uninsured, might not be able to pay damages.

If the answer might plausibly be yes then a trademark infringement suit is plausible, which,m even if won, is likely to be costly.Securing permission to use the names would avoid such problems. t might also include permission to use logos.

{"question":"Say I hosted a virtual private network somewhere on a cloud hosting provider, say an amazon aws server.  If I shared access to that VPN to other people (say for simplicity's sake, 5 friends), someone could potentially use it to access illegal content while trying to remain anonymous.I know I could be subpoenaed or sued for this.  Of course, being personally innocent, I would hand over the server logs, or do whatever was required of me.2 cases:If the logs showed that the illegal traffic was going to another IP address not in my possession, am I still liable for routing that traffic?If the logs for whatever reason couldn't prove that the illegal traffic was going to another specific IP address not in my possession, does liability default to me personally, for having ownership over the VPN server which routed it?I'm trying to ascertain the level of risk associated with hosting my own VPN server, for extra-personal use, but not as a business.  No contracts, no fees, just like a club that also accepts donations to keep the service alive.","answer":"Generally speaking, in U.S. law, a provider of a service via the Internet, such as a VPN, is immune from liability for user generated content pursuant to Section 230, so long as a copyright take-down notice is in place is complaints are lodged. So, you do not default to liability or have liability merely as a result of running a VPN.But, there is a second problem. If the VPN is very small and you can't be distinguished from other users, you could conceivably face risk not as a VPN operator, but as a user of the VPN who is confused for someone engaging in illegal activity.For example, suppose that there were five users, and that two could be ruled out due to being in places with no Internet access or being sick in the hospital, etc., leaving three possible suspects, and some weak circumstantial evidence pointed to you. You could easily become a prime suspect and maybe even end up on a terrorism watch list, even if it might be difficult or impossible to actually prove any wrongdoing on your part."}
{"question":"Through public internet group chats, I was able to meet a teenage girl that suffers from a medical condition. According to her, she lives in the US, but in a neglectful household where her parents pay little attention to her.Doctors say one of her limbs will have to be amputated eventually, but not in the near future, meaning that she will probably still have around ten years to pay for the surgery after becoming an adult.She seems to be already assuming that nor she nor her parents will pay for the surgery, so that she will simply lose her limb. I wonder however what her options are.My concerns are the following: what if, as an adult, she needs the surgery but is incapable of getting it due to lack of money?Are there any laws that will grant her the right to a free surgery since she is underage?Are her parents spared from paying for the surgery because she will have the option to pay for it herself one she is an adult?I would really appreciate any help.","answer":"Parents have a . The parents may therefore be in violation of the law, and anyone may report this to DSHS (specifically through Child Protective Services). This obligation terminates when the child turns 18 (assuming that someone does not petition for adult guardianship).Legislation is not crystal clear as far as what constitutes 'injury of a child ...under circumstances which cause harm to the child's health'. CPS has no authority to compel parents to pay for a medical treatment, but they can go to the courts on behalf of the child. At that point, it's hard to say what the court would order. For example, if the parents are capable of providing medical insurance and just willfully chose to not cover their child, the court could order them to get insurance. It is virtually guaranteed that the courts would not order the immediate amputation of the child's feet, and there would be no legal basis for ordering the parents to pay for the procedure in a decade, after the child is an adult. However, if you are suggesting that there is an immediate treatment (which the parents have opted to not provide, hence the prospects of later amputation), then it is reasonably likely that the courts would order the parents to provide for the treatment (if it would be possible for them; otherwise, the state may intervene and provide for the treatment)."}
{"question":"Okay, so I'm trying to start a series of articles explaining how the city government of Fort Worth, Texas operates  mostly as a writing exercise. I do however want to ensure I'm factually correct.The first article focuses on the basis of government  the Constitution, specifically exploring its power. In attempting to explain its legitimacy, I use the doctrine of implied consent to classify all U.S. citizens under the 'consent of the governed'.Is my explanation legally sound? This is the gist of it:Each State gained the right to make decisions on behalf of its citizens through the chartering of its land. When the United States ratified the Constitution, in accordance with Article 4, the States ceded all legal jurisdiction of the land to the newly created Federal Government. A government composed solely of members sworn by the Oath of Office to affirm the supremacy of the Constitution, therein confering upon it the full authority of the United States governement and military, both on the State, and Federal level.","answer":"Implied consent is a political theory idea, and not a legal one.

{"question":"What is the rationale for the scope of what EEOC prohibits discrimination against?More precisely, I have been fired for a trait of character (pessimism) that seems to me to be as much an integral & unchangeable part of my personality, as a transgender's sexual identity for instance. It's even possible my genetic make up might impact this trait of character.

There are very many such laws, passed by Congress:  of laws and associated regulations (for the statutes passed by Congress, look for the stuff labeled 'U.S.C'. For example, racial discrimination is prohibited, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So far, Congress has not made personality trait a protected class.

{"question":"Reading the First Amendment strictly through a textualist lens it is understood that Congress cannot limit our speech, but the First Amendment does not say anything about companies limiting it, or even the Executive branch limiting our freedom of expression through an executive order.First Amendment:Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.Since the First Amendment text is only about Congress's restrictions on making laws about speech, is the understanding that \"we have the freedom of speech\" based off of precedent set by courts?","answer":"Trivially, yesThe First Amendment was adopted on December 15, 1791.Every time there has been a dispute about what it means that has gone to court since then, the judgement of that court has established, overturned or clarified precedent - that's what common law courts do.The government can limit your speechThe Supreme Court has recognized categories of speech which receive lesser or no protection from the First Amendment. For example, inciting lawless actions, fighting words, true threats, obscenity, child pornography etc.They have also determined that it doesn't limit the government's power to impose reasonable time, place or manner restrictions on speech. As Justice Holmes put it in Schenck v. United States (1918), Even the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing panic.It applies to parts of government which derive their power from CongressWhich is, in most cases, all government.The executive actually has surprisingly little power granted by the Constitution (). All the other powers of the executive are technically delegated powers of Congress and are therefore subject to the First Amendment.Similarly, only the Supreme Court draws its mandate without going through Congress ) - all other courts are subject to First Amendment restrictions.It only restricts governmentThe limitation is a negative one on the US Congress (and through incorporation, the states). It does not, of itself, restrict private actors who are free to restrict speech however they want within their own property, including both physical and online spaces.It is open to the government to enact laws that would extend an affirmative right to free speech onto non-state actors (see ), however, the Federal government has not done so and neither have most states."}
{"question":"According to  the Boys and Girls Club of America is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, whose CEO is salaried at over $800,000.00.So clearly, it is legal for the CEOs\/officers of a 501(c)(3) to take a salary.What about 501(c)(7) \"social clubs\"? Can their officers take salaries? Why or why not? If they can, how does this not \"inure to their benefit\"?","answer":"The legal standard for salaries from a 501(c)(7) organization is that no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder is arguably slightly more permissive than the rule that applies to 501(c)(3) organizations, which is that no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual[.]So, at a minimum, a 501(c)(7) organization may pay an officer of the organization an amount equal to the fair market value of those services in a comparable for profit organization.It isn't entirely clear to me without further detailed research if the omission of the or individual clause in 501(c)(7) actually has legal significance in the context of gift-like benefits to someone other than on account of being a member or owner of a club. It probably does allow some kinds of transactions of this type.If they can, how does this not inure to their benefit?The legal theory is that one is looking at net benefit. If an officer does valuable work for which the officer receives compensation, the officer is making a barter of two things of equal value: the officer's valuable services for money. There is no net benefit to the officer who merely breaks even economically in a salary transaction.In contrast, a payment on account of a membership in or ownership of the club, or simply as a gift from the entity to an individual not directly incidental to its expressly permitted tax exempt purpose, involved the individual or private company receiving something without providing something substantially equivalent in return. So, this is a net benefit to the individual or private company that receives something from the 501(c) organization."}
{"question":"Federal judges in the United States are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate. The constitution does not impose any restrictions on who may be appointed and confirmed as a federal judge.Where the constitution prescribes limitations on eligibility for the Presidency and Congress, those limitations have been held to be exhaustive (for example, term limits cannot be imposed on Congress because doing so would be inserting eligibility requirements in addition to those in the constitution).If Article III is interpreted using a similar principle, then it means that notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the President may appoint, and the Senate may confirm, any living human as a federal judge, and the conflicting provisions in the law would be unconstitutional.Is there precedent regarding this issue?Have any legal experts opined about this issue?","answer":"The US Congress contains a number of legal experts, and Congress has imposed statutory limits on certain federal judicial positions (), so you could take that to be weak evidence that qualifications are constitutional.

Presumably those whose debt was discharged won't have standing because they didn't suffer any damages but how about Congress or some other government institution?","answer":"Not less than a full house of Congress, and perhaps Congress as a whole, might have standing. It is hard to see anyone else who would. The  (the link is to a report of the Congressional Research Service, a policy research arm of the Library of Congress that does research for Congress) is quite involved and is not perfectly consistent and clear. Congress would argue that it has suffered an institutional injury as an institution and perhaps authorize someone to bring suit on its behalf via a joint resolution.As the Court explained in Arizona State Legislature, aninstitutional injury is an injury that scarcely zeroe[s] in on anyindividual member, but rather impact[s] all Members of Congress andboth Houses . . . equally.There is considerable uncertainty regarding how this would be applied which is not really at issue in this case at the present time since Democrats control both houses of Congress and support the President in this policy.Individuals legislators lack standing to sue in a case like this one.See also Tara Leigh Grove &amp; Neal Devins, Congresss (Limited) Power to Represent Itself in Court, 99 Cornell L.

{"question":"I'm thinking here of both UK and US law, which I assume will differ. Suppose a defendant in a civil case (type of case unspecified) would ordinarily have no defence against the plaintiff\/claimant's claim, and would be ruled against in damages for a large sum. The defendant had a confirmed mental health condition (also of unspecified type) which is agreed overwhelmingly likely to have been a (or the) cause of whatever action(s) gave rise to the case.In what circumstances and to what extent will this change the ruling, or the amount ruled against them, in US or UK law?Some examples, although I'm really after general principles, these just illustrate the situation. (In each case assume the incident was unexpected and either no other person helps\/cares for them, or any such people could not reasonably have foreseen\/prevented it and would not be liable). I haven't numbered these because I'm really looking for principles and generalities rather than answers to these hypothetical examples:Person has 'walking insomnia'. While sleepwalking one night they commit an act against a person or property which would usually result in a valid civil claim for damages.Person has trauma and cannot always control their reactions when it is triggered; they run out of a shop when something triggers it and knock over numerous people and displayed products\/shop fittings.Person has cancer in part of their brain that controls self regulation. Nothing happens until one day they attack somebody, an act for which they have no prior history, and agreed to be due to their medical condition.Ditto but the issue is a congenital or regenerative neurological condition, and their family do not knew or cannot react in time to prevent an actionable incident.Person has ADHD (ADD) or OCD, and is functional in society but medically it is agreed they will never have good or even usual control of attention wandering or forgetfulness or compulsive behaviours, there simply is no way to gain this. Damage results.A reluctant parent with a bad parent-child relationship hears a rumour on the internet that mental health is no defence against civil damage claims, and decides to sue their offspring for massive damage caused to their house on the night of their 18th birthday. Because of the stress they had also not recognised their parents who arrived, and believing themselves attacked by strangers, slashed at them with a knife in panic, causing life-changing injury.  Their condition had never remotely been like this before and there was no realistic way to anticipate it might happen, nor any incident previously requiring precautions. Conveniently on that day the youngster also inherited the kind of sum that would be needed to pay any damages if the claim were successful. ","answer":"The person with a mental health condition is as liable as the person without all else being equal.The standard in common law (and civil law) systems is the  - what would a reasonably prudent person in the same (external) circumstances do.The standard can be increased by replacing the noun: for example, a person who is or purports to be a doctor will be held to the standard of a 'reasonable doctor' if the damage flows from acts or omissions as a doctor. Similarly, a 'reasonable oncologist' is held to a higher standard than a 'reasonable doctor' if the damage stems from acts or omissions related to cancer.Further a person who purports to be an 'expert' in the field is held to the standard of a 'reasonable expert'. However, the standard is not lowered to account for things that make a person less prudent than a reasonable person: like mental illness for example."}
{"question":"In the US it is common practice for sellers of firearms to follow the following process:Ask buyer to fill out Call NICS to verify that the DOJ\/FBI is not aware of any prohibitions against the transfer (I'm not sure which agency exactly handles this call)NICS may approve or deny the transfer right away, but they may also delay it so they can take additional time (days) to review the requestThere is a commonly stated provision that if NICS does not make a decision in 3 days, the seller may proceed with the transfer. So in effect transfers are automatically approved after 3 days.I know there are various laws prohibiting the transfer of firearms to certain people, such as felons or fugitives. However, is there a law on how a transferee is to determine that a buyer is not such a prohibited person, and how long this may take? Specifically, I'm curious to know:Is there a law that background checks may not delay a firearm transfer by X days?Is there a law saying that background checks may not delay a firearm transfer \"excessively\" without giving a number of days?Is the above process with 4473, NICS and the 3 day cap specified in a law, or is it just a policy the ATF came up with on its own?If the DOJ\/FBI uses a way to delay the transfer by more than 3 days, are they breaking any laws?Clearly, when the above process was put in place, there was some concern that the background check would be a way for the government to slow walk each purchase and infringe on the rights of the public to keep and bear arms. Accordingly, there is a rule that the background check will take at most 3 days, and if it's not done by then the transfer is approved by default. This seems a reasonable compromise between the need for an opportunity to catch prohibited transferees, while also limiting the harm to those that are not prohibited.To summarize the question, where is this 3 day compromise coming from? Did Congress pass a law to this effect, or did SCOTUS (or another court) rule that it must be so?

Most individuals were very eager to retain their records, and grateful that we did not destroy them.","answer":"That really sucks. I've had similar experiences when handling the probate proceedings of lawyers who were not good about returning original wills to clients. I am providing an answer under general principles without researching Oregon specific accounting, record retention and probate laws, to at least give you a start although I recognize that a better answer would research these questions.  The accounts\/clients from her business were sold to another woman. Is  it legal for us to transfer everything to her possession?Probably yes. There should be a government agency in Oregon that regulates accountants that has rules regarding that question. The  seems to govern this situation. It says in Rule 801-030-0015(d) that:  (d) Custody and disposition of working papers.    (A) A licensee may not sell, transfer or bequeath working papers  described in this rule to anyone other than one or more surviving  partners or stockholders, or new partners or stockholders of the  licensee, or any combined or merged organization or successor in  interest to the licensee, without the prior written consent of the  client or the clients personal representative or assignee.    (B) A licensee is not prohibited from making a temporary transfer of  working papers or other material necessary to the conduct of peer  reviews or for the disclosure of information as provided by section  (1)(b) of this rule.    (C) A licensee shall implement reasonable procedures for the safe  custody of working papers and shall retain working papers for a period  sufficient to meet the needs of the licensees practice and to satisfy  applicable professional standards and pertinent legal requirements for  record retention.    (D) A licensee shall retain working papers during the pendency of any  Board investigation, disciplinary action, or other legal action  involving the licensee. Licensees shall not dispose of such working  papers until notified in writing by the Board of the closure of the  investigation or until final disposition of the legal action or  proceeding if no Board investigation is pending.So, a transfer to a successor firm appears to be permitted.  What if she refuses to take the documents?Her probate estate could retain them and stay open, they could be returned to clients, or there could be a rule established by the Oregon body that regulates accountants that authorizes a central depository of such records. In Colorado, for example, in the case of law practices with no successors, original wills and estate planning documents can be deposited in the records of the court with probate jurisdiction that has jurisdiction over the territory where the decedent's practice was located.But, I could not locate any provision of this kind in Oregon law.  Is it legal for us to destroy\/shred\/etc. the documents?In many cases, yes. Some states, by statute or regulation, and others by custom, allow business records to be destroyed as a matter of course, normally one year after the longest statute of limitations that could apply to a dispute where the records would be relevant (often seven years since the longest normally applicable tax statute of limitations is six years).Destroying tax returns is usually not a big concern because a transcript of the old tax returns can be ordered from the tax collection agency where they were filed. But, business records related to purchases of property and capital improvements and depreciation, and related to divorces, can be relevant for decades after they were created, so the more honorable course of action would be to make at least a cursory effort (such as a postcard sent to a last known address of each client with a deadline for requesting a return of their file) to return the files of clients that include original business records as opposed to mere copies of tax returns.Oregon has a seven year retention rule for most purposes pursuant to Rule 801-030-0015(e) which is linked above:  (e) Retention of attest and audit working papers.    (A) Licensees must maintain, for a period of at least seven years, the  working papers for any attest or compilation services performed by the  licensee together with any other supporting information, in sufficient  detail to support the conclusions reached in such services.    (B) The seven-year retention period described in paragraph (A) of this  subsection is extended if a longer period is required for purposes of  a Board investigation as provided in paragraph (d)(D) of this rule and  .The referenced rule in that rule states:  (3) Requirements upon resignation. Upon resignation, a former licensee  is required to:    (a) Surrender the CPA certificate or PA license to the Board;    (b) Take all reasonable steps to avoid foreseeable harm to any client,  including but not limited to providing written notice of resignation  under this section to all clients and inform all clients of where  client records and work papers will be stored and of the clients  right to secure copies of all such records and work papers at no cost  to the client;    (c) Maintain client records for a period of at least six years, or  return such records to the client; and    (d) Continue to comply with the requirements of OAR Chapter 801  Division 030 pertaining to confidential information and client  records.    (e) For the purpose of subsection (b) above and unless otherwise  required by the Board, a resigning licensee of a registered firm is  required to give written notice to only those firm clients for which  the resigning licensee was the sole or primary CPA on an engagement,  an engagement leader, or the client relationship manager.In practice, the consequences of destroying a record that shouldn't have been destroyed are likely to be minimal, because any recovery would be limited to the assets of the estate and there is a time limit for making claims against estates which is quite strict, and your grandma has no license to revoke. But, again, the honorable thing to do in order to honor her legacy and do right by her former clients would be to either transfer the records to a successor firm or to attempt to return them, as she would be required to do if she had surrendered a license during life."}

(3) Unless excluded or modified (Section 2-316) other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade.The  states that:  Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under the next section an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.This means that the warranties in \u00a7 2-314 will generally apply to products that are sold, unless excluded as per \u00a7 2-316  (2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous.Licenses that specifically exclude implied warranty are sanctioned by the UCC, and therefore would be considered in the United States. defines a sale as passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price.States may have additional laws that may affect the interpretation of the UCC.

(2)  A term of a contract is not taken, for the purposes of this section, to exclude, restrict or modify the application of a provision of this Division unless the term does so expressly or is inconsistent with the provision.      67   Conflict of laws  If:  (a)  the proper law of a contract for the supply of goods or services to a consumer would be the law of any part of Australia but for a term of the contract that provides otherwise; or  (b)  a contract for the supply of goods or services to a consumer contains a term that purports to substitute, or has the effect of substituting, the following provisions for all or any of the provisions of this Division:  (i)  the provisions of the law of a country other than Australia;  (ii)  the provisions of the law of a State or a Territory;  the provisions of this Division apply in relation to the supply under the contract despite that term.   What the above sections mean : (54) there are implied statutory warranties (64) that cannot be excluded by contract, (67) and applies even if the proper law of a contract is not Australia.It is important to note that these do not depend on the existence of a contract (see 54(1)); gifts are covered, though I am unaware of any case law on this. In addition, title (s51) and non-infringement ('undisturbed possession') (s52) must be guaranteed by the supplier and cannot be excluded.In addition, the mere existence of this statement, purporting to limit or remove guarantees that cannot be limited or excluded, puts the supplier in breach of s29 as they are making a 'false or misleading statement in connection with the supply, possible supply or promotion of goods or services'. This is a criminal or civil offence and can be punished by fines of up to $1.1 million for a body corporate and $220,000 for a person other than a body corporate plus injunctions, damages, compensatory orders and other remedies. However, a simple 'To the extent permitted by law ...' at the start would make this legal.So, does it have an effect? Sometimes. But not always. And at least in the United States, there are specific requirements if you want to exclude implied\/statutory warranty."}
{"question":"In my opinion, not so much. I haven't got much experience with the US justice system, but everything the detective learns is hearsay, so (s)he can't tell the jury what witness so-and-so says. (S)he sends everything to the crine lab for testing, but only the scientist can testify about the results. So really, all (s)he can ever say is, 'I was the lead detective. I talked to some people. I sent some stuff to the lab. I wrote some reports.' Things like that can be cross-examined quite easily.","answer":"How useful a lead detective will be as a murder witness in a trial inside of the courtroom?Very useful. As a murder witness, the detective's testimony can be more useful than the average witness's because the detective's training renders him capable of paying attention to important elements that to the average witness tend to go unnoticed.Outside the murder witness capacity, your description oversimplifies the detective's role in an investigation. The detective is more than a clerk who takes notes and delivers items to a facility. His scrutiny of the evidence can highlight to the fact-finder a number of inconsistencies and nuances that are far-reaching, more relevant than I talked to some people and I wrote some reports."}
{"question":"Last week I went to dinner with friends where I met a guy (a friend of a friend). After dinner he offered to come up for a drink to his place, he made me a cocktail, I had two sips then my other friend called me and I decided to go meet her. I got up to leave, he grabbed my arms, pulled on him and started choking me. Next thing I remember, I woke up 30 min later face down on the floor. He acted like nothing happened. When I opened my eye all I wanted to do was crying, I left immediately and call the cops. I submitted all my bloodwork and other evidence.The guy is coming from a very well know and powerful family. At this point I'm convinced that it's not his first time doing something like that.My question is, if I decide to take him to court what are my chances to win the case, and what evidence do I need to win it?","answer":"The key to proving the alleged crime would be to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that you did not give consent to the sexual encounter i.e. that it happened against your free will. For example, if there is evidence that you indeed were asleep\/unconscious (which in turn could be supported by some evidence that the drink contained something that could make you fall asleep) that would be sufficient because an asleep person cannot give consent.If you simply say that you were asleep without further proof, but he says you were not and that you gave consent, that will probably raise doubt sufficient to acquit him.His primary line of defense would be that you freely accepted his invitation and came up to his place. Whereas this does not by itself mean that you consented to sex, it strongly adds up to the doubt that you did not  which is usually enough to acquit a defendant in a criminal trial."}
{"question":"I am currently watching the Depp\/Heard trial, and there seems to be a lot of stuff that cannot be shown, or said, and a lot of people i would expect to make a statement are absent.My guess is that there are rulings in place that preclude certain witnesses from being called, certain evidence from being shown, and certain topics from being broached - but how, and why? And are those constraints known to the jury? For instance, there was a last minute witness that somehow offered herself up to testify, a very crucial character witness, that i would have thought the plaintiff would spare no expense in finding. There was a photo expert that was somehow prevented from talking about colors, there is a lot of confusion about the existence or non-existence of a wall mounted phone, but both parties have refrained from showing images of the wall that the phone should have hung on - although the existence of such photos is a near certainty, etc.So my questions: How are such no-show-no-tell boundaries established, does the jury get to know them, and is this also in the public record somehow?","answer":"How are such no-show-no-tell boundaries establishedThey largely stem from the rules of evidence which are complicated, vary from state to state and knowing which is a big part of what litigation attorneys are paid for.Parties to litigation become aware of all the evidence\/topics that their counterparts wish to broach in the courtroom well in advance  during . They will usually disagree whether some bits and pieces can be presented to the jury. In this case the court will hold admissibility hearings  again, well in advance before the trial.Despite all the preparations, some of these disagreements arise during the trial, and then they are resolved in place by way of voiced objections. The attorneys and the judge talk about them using professional jargon of the rules of evidence  having themselves seen all the evidence in advance.does the jury get to know themNo, the jury doesn't need to follow the professional talk. In fact, they should hear as little as possible of it  which is the reason why admissibility disagreements are resolved in advance as much as possible. If serious issues arise during the trial, the judge will ask the attorneys to speak to them in chambers  away from the jury. Or they will ask the jury to take a break while the professionals talk.The jury just needs to listen to the evidence that is allowed in, and disregard any evidence the judge say they have to.is this also in the public record somehow?It is in the court record. It may be accessible to the public if the court allows. If someone wishes to see the record they need to apply to the court, provide reasons and a judge will decide if anything can be released."}
{"question":"There's been a lot of discussion in the media lately about the question of whether a sitting president can be indicted.The Constitution says that in order to be vice-president one must have the same qualifications that the Constitution requires of the president (being at least 35 years old, being a 'natural-born citizen', etc.).How much do the questions of indictment of the president and indictment of the vice-president have in common?Am I right in thinking that in 1973 the vice-president actually was indicted (for having taken bribes when he was governor of Maryland)?","answer":"The President not being the subject of an indictment is a Department of Justice rule. It is meant to prevent people from charging the president with crimes in order to stop him from doing his duty. It does not really apply to the VP.As for Agnew, he resigned and took a plea deal. "}

After searching a little bit, I found some code that I could get working which interacts with  repository where the developer seems to have gotten into trouble with the WhatsApp Inc.Since I am not experienced in any kind of law (especially not american), I wanted to ask whether it is allowed to build such an app (in general). Where the boundaries of that are, especially for making profit of it, like: In-App-Advertisment, Donations or other ways of making profit. Another interesting thought on profit was to make a website that acts as landing page, that has advertisment on it, what about that ?

For their purposes this is cheaper than getting those employees hotel rooms or waiting for the permits to arrive.Is there any issue with the companys management officially deciding to ignore the permit system and just pay the fine?

The school has denied this payment, and he is threatening to get a lawyer just to make the district lose money (he really hates this school).Is the school legally required to accept pennies as payment for a service (parking in the parking lot) or can they request that he pay in bills only?","answer":"Title 31 (Money and Finance), Subtitle IV (Money), Chapter 51 (Coins and Currency), Subchapter I (Monetary System), Section 5103 (Legal Tender) of the United States Code states:   United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.

{"question":"There have been news stories about individuals threatening to kill President-elect Donald Trump shortly after the election, such as  who did it over Twitter. According to the news article, he tweeted it at 1:42am EDT on the day after Election Day. However, it wasn't until 3:00am EDT that Trump secured 270 Electoral College votes (at least according to the media, since the Electoral College does not meet until later).From a legal standpoint, when exactly is a person considered to be 'President-elect' regarding the laws to threaten the President?","answer":"The US legal code regarding threatening a president is . The first clause defines how threatening the president is illegal. The second clause starts off by defining 'President-elect':  The terms President-elect and Vice President-elect as used in this section shall mean such persons as are the apparent successful candidates for the offices of President and Vice President, respectively, as ascertained from the results of the general elections held to determine the electors of President and Vice President in accordance with title 3, United States Code, sections 1 and 2.So the key here is that they are the 'the apparent successful candidates [\u2026]  as ascertained from the results of the general elections.' It doesn't define this phrase though, especially the word 'apparent'. It appears that the prosecutors in the case mentioned in the question are arguing that Donald Trump became the apparent President-elect when, after Election Day, voting results began coming in and he was projected to win 270 electoral votes. Given the amount of stock that most Americans seem to put into the media's coverage of who wins the election (and the fact that the person in question seems to have assumed he would be president), that's unlikely to be contested."}

{"question":"This question is not about the initial crime of computer hacking, but rather whether a person who acquires private data from the hacker has committed a crime.There is a curious footnote in the famous Mueller report, where apparently the investigators are contemplating potential federal violations for receiving 'hacked' digital data. The footnote (page 176) follows: Intuitively, the average person, would anticipate that private digital information (for example banking passwords, credit card security codes, ATM and debit card passwords, etc) would fall under the notion of personal property, and thus trafficking (sale and resale) of such data would be subject to prosecution.However, this footnote seems to suggest that, because the data is intangible, it is not considered stolen property, consequently non-prosecutable.Have I understood this correctly?Are there other laws that apply to digital data that has been stolen?","answer":"There are many state and federal laws that apply to digital data such as credit card numbers, bank account numbers, social security numbers, etc. because while that data may be 'intangible' in a traditional sense - such as the difference between a hard copy letter and an email of the same text - the difference is the potential monetary value of a bank account or card number or full social security number-based identity.See  for bank fraud, wire fraud, etc. Search a relevant state for that code and laws.Depending on state jurisdiction and federal law, there can be differences in simply possessing such data, selling or transferring the information and\/or actually using it for fraud. But all you have to do is read the news and you'll see that bank and card fraud is very prevalent and is prosecuted.Banks and credit card companies and prosecutors can't possibly go after all fraud due to manpower and simple math that makes much of it not worth the effort to pursue; much credit card and identity theft fraud is refunded to the customer and taken as a loss to the bank."}

The member of staff attending me might not have noticed, but I muttered 'If you're recording me...' and tailed off with a smile as I held it before clicking the record button. The member of staff went to a forceful raised voice way of speaking immediately and told me it was illegal for me to record in their office. We went back and forth on the subject, me pointing out their sign, but he wouldn't progress with the car pickup until I showed him that the device was off.What's the legal status of a person recording an interaction with a business, when the business has a blanket statements (sign in this case but it could easily be audio at the start of a telephone call too) about 'you may be recorded'?

It might even be unconstitutional for them to do so, because it would effectively be a governmental punishment for a crime for which you are presumed innocent.The fact that the arrests would be roughly eight years old at the time you would be applying for a license would likely diminish their relevance.You might be asked to explain any arrest in your licensing application, but an explanation that made clear that the arrests did not result in a conviction ought to be adequate."}

This, in turn, will simply erode the influence that American companies have across the whole of Russia (and also across the globe as more people switch to UnionPay, which is nowadays accepted in a whole lot of places including America), not simply the small area actually subject to the sanctions.Aren't all of these companies like VISA and MasterCard actually incorporated in the Bahamas, etc., anyways?

{"question":"I find it interesting that apparently judges are allowed to read news and opinions about the litigation in front of them, whereas juries would not be.Why is there such a distinction, and are there any limitations to ensure fair rulings?For example, this is regarding ), where the judge apparently cites some industry study about copyright trolls, and explicitly names the plaintiff as such, denying its motions and dropping the lawsuit.","answer":"Your question slightly misrepresents what the article says: Yes, the judge denied the motion which led to the collapse of the case, he did not make a ruling on the substance of the case.The distinction is significant to my mind as the judge was using non-evidentiary knowledge (i.e. what he read in the paper) to make a decision on process; in this case a process that would have put a lot of people to a lot of inconvenience. It would not be proper for the judge to have used such knowledge to inform a judgement.It is also not clear from the article if the academic paper in question was actually introduced by the defendant as evidence. If that was the case then it is only right and proper for the judge to consider it.As to why a judge is allowed to read the news and a jury is not, I can offer several ideas:A judge must document their reasoning process in a judgement which is subject to review - if they were to make a decision based on matters not supported by the evidence then an appeals court could correct it. Alternatively, juries are specifically prohibited from revealing their reasoning process to anyone.Judges do their jobs for years, perhaps a whole career - to prohibit them from consuming media is a) unworkable and b) a serious impediment on their lifestyle. Juries are empaneled for weeks or months - such sacrifices are more reasonable.Judges are (supposedly) trained and impartial professionals who are more readily able to make the distinction between evidence and news.Newsworthy cases are relatively rare"}
{"question":"Not long ago I learned that the Crown can appeal from verdicts of acquittal in Canada, unlike prosecutors in the U.S.I once thought that the reason why U.S. judges cannot set aside a jury's verdict of acquittal is that it would violate a right to trial by jury, but law.stackexchange.com told me that that is not the reason; rather the reason was that double jeopardy is not allowed. If the U.S. sees an impermissible double jeopardy in the prosecution's appeal from a verdict of acquittal or in a judge's setting aside such a verdict, and Canada sees no impermissble double jeopardy in an appeal by the Crown, might Canada also see nothing impermissible in a judge's setting aside the acquittal verdict?","answer":"Double Jeopardy in the U.S. does have some exceptions to it, and this might not be impermissible in the United State.  There's generally three exceptions, and I'll discuss from most common to least common.  First, I'd like to clarify two things:For my discussions the term 'Event' will be used to indicate a specific alleged crime and will be specifically original with respect to alleged perpetrator, victim, and time, manner, and place involved in the crime.In the U.S., Double Jeopardy is often best understood as a ban on the prosecution (state) from initiating the appellant process.   They can only appeal subsequent decisions after the defendant appeals the initial case.   The defendant will appeal a decision if they are found guilty, but would never appeal an acquittal.   Since the prosecution cannot initiate appeals, the only time they will happen is following a guilty verdict.  Double Jeopardy is also specific to one event.  If Alice is acquitted of a charge of Murder for killing Bob, she cannot be tried for the murder of Bob ever again. She can still be prosecuted on a charge of Murder for killing Charlie as the two events are separate (by dint of the fact that the victims are different) and for perjury if she testified falsely to her innocence in killing Bob (i.e. new evidence brought to light would have convicted her after the fact).  This is also a seperate event as the new trial is about whether she lied while under oath, not if she killed Bob.That out of the way, in the U.S. there are three general exceptions:Dual Sovereignty -  Double Jeopardy only applies to a single court system, while all U.S. citizens are under at least 2 court systems jurisdictions at any time: Their State (or territorial) and the Federal Government while in U.S. Geographic Territory (and Embassies and overseas holdings).   Typically the states prosecute most crimes first and the Feds will prosecute any related crimes second.  If it's between two or more states, the Feds and all states party to the crime will have to negotiate, though typically the feds will defer to states first.   If a state and the federal government have the same law, the feds may prosecute for the exact same crime regardless of outcome.For example, suppose a man illegally crosses the Canadian Border into Montana and kills someone.  The state of Montana can prosecute the illegal immigrant for murder and the U.S. federal government can prosecute him for both Murder and Illegal immigration.   In practice, however, the Federal Government usually will respect the outcome of the state's case for all similar crimes so the defendant could be acquitted of Murder in Montana, and the Federal Government will likely drop the charge and just try him for illegal immigration (a strictly federal crime).   There are some situations where the feds will try the murder despite the conviction, but it's usually if federal prosecuters think that some shenanigans were involved. At the absolute worst, as many as 7 seperate courts could have jurisdiction on one event (If you commit a crime at the Four Corners (the border between Colorodo, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, the only place in the U.S. where four states share a border) in addition to the Federal Government and two Tribal governments (the Utes in Utah and the Navajo in the other three all have reservation jurisdiction at this point.   In the case of the Navajo, they only have one reservation in the three states, so they don't get three seperate cracks at it.).Directed Verdict - Less likely, but still a possibility, Directed Verdict occurs when a Judge tells the jury  to render a verdict for a charge.  If this occurs, it will be immediately after the Prosectuion resting their case and before the Defense calls their witnesses.  The Defense is entitled to make a motion for dismissal of charges and if granted, the Judge will instruct the Jury to find 'Not Guilty' for at least one charge if not all of them.   Basically, they are granted if the Prosecution fails to even meet evidence burden of the charges that he grants.   It's actually quite common to make the motion, though it is rare to have it granted.   The Judge may also consider making the grant after closing remarks before giving the case to the jury for deliberation.  If it is granted, the Prosection will be given the right to appeal the verdict.   If you'd like to look up some cases, the directed verdict was granted to some charges in one of the Freddy Grey Murder trials (I forget which of the defendants got it, but it wasn't appealed as the rest of the charges were found 'Not Guilty') and a Defimation case against Project Veritas (though this was a civil case, the judge felt the elements of Defimation were not met by the prosection to sufficently even let the jury decide.  The Plaintiff may start appeals in Civil cases, so Double Jeopardy is not a thing.  One of the Defendants has a description of the experience on their Youtube Channel if you would like to learn more about the case).Fixing the Trial - If it can be proven that some of the jury or the  judge in a bench trial were unfairly biased to the Defendant through means outside of the court and acquitted the defendant, then the defendant was never 'in danger of life or limb' to quote the Constitution, and thus, a second trial on the same event is not a violation of Double Jeopardy because they weren't in Jeopardy the first time.   This has happened exactly once in all of U.S. History (a member of the Chicago Mob was given a bench trial and the judge was bribed to find the defendant 'not guilty.'  The Judge eventually confessed to this in his suicide note and the courts ruled that jury or judge tampering to be an exception to Double Jeopardy with respect to the original trial.  The mobster was tried for the exact same event in the exact same court twice and found Guilty, the only time this has ever occurred in U.S. History.).It should be pointed out that mistrials and new trials granted on appeal are not exceptions as in both instances, the legal fiction in place is that the original trial never happened and the Defendant is being tried for the first time.  Mistrials can be declared prior to the verdict by anyone, but only by request of the Defense on appeals, and new trials are always granted by the defense on appeal.  The Prosecution has to recharge the defense with the crime and may choose not to for any number of reasons (from the case was weak and barely got the guilty verdict to losing evidence critical to securing a new guilty verdict to the recovery of exculpatory evidence that proves the Defense was innocent all along.)."}

{"question":"I am trying to wrap my head around when exactly music enters the public domain and how to work out whether a song is in the public domain.I'm particularly interested in marching music. For American marches, as I understand it, before 1923 everything is public domain. Is there a similar provision in Britain?I am particularly interested in the marches of Kenneth J Alford, as he died in 1945, which is 71 years ago. As I understand it in Britain copyright on all his music should have lapsed in 2015 (so this year all his works should be public domain).Edit: I know that any recordings would be copyright at a later date, but my recordings are verified public domain.Is this the case?","answer":"Your question seems to be based on the premise that the music of US composers, for example, is controlled by US law, and that of British composers by British law.  This is incorrect.For example, consider a piece of music written in 1920 by a composer who died in 1970.  That piece is in the public domain in the United States, but will enjoy copyright protection in Britain until December 31, 2040.  This is true regardless of the composer's place of birth or nationality, be it the United States, the United Kingdom, or the United Arab Emirates.The reason the US copyright situation is somewhat different is that US copyright law has been somewhat different.

Alford, but you do not say whether you are interested in knowing whether his music is in the public domain in the United States, the United Kingdom, or elsewhere.  In the United Kingdom, as you note, it appears that his music has indeed entered the public domain.  In the United States, it would depend for any given piece on whether the piece was published in the United States and whether the copyright was renewed in the piece's 28th year.  From the Wikipedia article:  For works published or registered before 1978, the maximum copyright duration is 95 years from the date of publication, if copyright was renewed during the 28th year following publication.The article goes on to say that  The need for renewal was eliminated by the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992, but works that had already entered the public domain by non-renewal did not regain copyright protection. Therefore, works published before 1964 that were not renewed are in the public domain.To know whether Alford's later work is still under copyright protection in the United States, it would be necessary to know whether the copyright was renewed.  I found a renewal for the Eagle Squadron march in 1969, and the piece was composed in 1942, so that march, at least, seems still to be protected in the United States.

{"question":"Under U.S. law, almost all kinds of disputes between people who have contractual relationships with each other can be subject to binding arbitration with no appeal right or class action rights through a contractual term with only minimal regulation of the arbitration process.In English law, are there significant classes of civil disputes that can not be subjected to arbitration? For example, is binding pre-dispute arbitration prohibited (or required) for any significant subset of consumer disputes, landlord-tenant disputes, realtor disputes, employment disputes, banking disputes, or international disputes?Or, for example, are there contexts in which the duty to arbitrate is subject to strict scrutiny, either based upon either the arbitration process or the nature of the subject matter subject to arbitration?Also, in civil disputes, when they are subject to arbitration clauses, is the arbitration process subject to significant legal regulation in English law? For example, is the business\/profession of arbitrating civil disputes one that requires licensing and is subject to government regulation that affects the arbitration process in any material respect?To be clear, when I say 'arbitration', I mean a pre-dispute agreement to have a non-governmental private individual or firm resolve a civil dispute between parties bound by a common agreement of some kind, in lieu of resort to civil courts, where the agreement is binding without further action of the parties (with or without a right to a trial de novo or appeal of the decision either within the arbitration context or to a civil court). I do not mean mediation in which the parties are required to discuss settlement with the aid of a third party facilitator that only has any legal effect if both parties affirmative sign some sort of settlement agreement to particular terms after those terms are known.","answer":"It is not true to say that there is only minimal regulation of arbitration in the US: arbitrations are conducted under law, usually the  but sometimes equivalent state laws and must be conducted in accordance with the rules agreed to by the parties. Further they can be appealed, however, the grounds for appeal are restricted to those enumerated in the Act or agreed by the parties.In general, this is the case for all jurisdictions including England, however, the specific Acts that makes arbitration legal are different in each jurisdiction.Section 69 of the UK Arbitration Act 1996 enumerates the rights of appeal and which may and may not be excluded. That said, appeals from arbitrations are rarely initiated and exen more rarely upheld. A recent decision, NYK Bulkship (Atlantic) NV v Cargill International SA [2016] UKSC 20 has clarified this section:The only two grounds to challenge an award which cannot be waived in an English-seated arbitration are those of substantive jurisdiction or serious irregularity. The right to appeal an award on a point of law is not a mandatory provision of the English Arbitration Act 1996.Where this right to appeal on a point of law has not been excluded, an appeal can be brought under section 69 only with the agreement of the parties to the dispute or with the permission of the court.Under section 69(3), the court can only grant permission if (a) the determination of the point of law will substantially affect the rights of one or more parties, (b) the question is one which the tribunal was asked to answer, (c) the arbitral award is obviously wrong or else the decision is open to serious doubt and concerns a question of general public importance, and (e) it is just and proper for the court to rule on this issue despite the parties agreeing to resolve the dispute by arbitration.It is then at the court's discretion to confirm, vary or set aside the award or else to remit it to the tribunal in whole or in part for reconsideration in the light of their ruling. However, the statute provides that the court shall not exercise its power to set aside an award unless it is satisfied that it would be inappropriate to remit the award to the tribunal for reconsideration.As far as I know arbitration clauses in England are not mandatory in any class of contract nor can a court order arbitration (but they can order mediation). They are restricted in employment contracts where the employee has a statutory right to appeal to an employment tribunal in that they cannot be the sole remedy and they are prohibited in insolvency proceedings and criminal matters.Other than impartiality, there are no requirements under the Arbitration Act relating to the qualifications and characteristics of arbitrators. It is not necessary for an arbitrator to be a national of, or licensed to practice in, England.While not strictly relevant to English law  in the USA and Canada on the unconscionably of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts (where one party can offer a take-it-or-leave-it contract to the other) have come to diametrically opposed conclusions. In the USA these are enforceable, in Canada they are not: probably a reflection of the different attitude of the jurisdictions on laissez-faire versus social welfare styles of capitalism although in both jurisdictions they were 5-4 decisions so more finely balanced than you might think.I would guess that English courts would probably find the Candadian rather than the US decision more persuasive if and when the question is asked. In other common law countries, Australia is almost certainly on Canada's side particularly since for small-business contracts the standard is (since 16 November 2016) whether a term is unfair rather than unconscionable."}
{"question":"I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask, but I had a quick question regarding using the word\/trademark 'GitHub' in my Android application's source code (not that actual part that users can view). I am considering developing and distributing an Android application on the Google Play Store. I was following along with the Android Developer docs on creating an Android app () and came across Step 4, where I needed to 'configure the project'. In the tutorial, the docs recommended entering the value 'com.example.myfirstapp' for the package name. I am now attempting to create an actual application (not a Hello World app).I am currently utilizing the free tier of GitHub Pages for my personal website, and plan to create an Organization Pages site that is structured like so: ''. If I used that site structure for my package name, it would look like this: 'io.github.myfirstapp.myfirstapp' ('myfirstapp' is twice because it is the name of the website and then the name of the actual app).However, I was wondering if I could legally use the word 'GitHub' in my package name since I believe it is trademarked? I plan to sell this application to users, so I would be profiting from this app. Note that I am not planning to use the word 'GitHub' in the name of my app when I market it on the Google Play Store (I wouldn't call my app 'The GitHub App!', etc.).I was trying to create my first app and I was on a low budget, so I decided that I should make use of the free option of GitHub Pages (pages.github.com) to market my app. The free option of GitHub Pages provides me with a URL that has the word 'GitHub' in it: 'example.github.io'. The above is only background details - my question is not regarding that. I was inquiring specifically about using that URL with the word 'GitHub' in the source code of my Android app. I plan to open-source the app on GitHub, so obviously, the source code would be visible to anyone who was interested in viewing it. So, I am in fact wondering if I can legally 'use the word 'GitHub' in [the] source code 'not the part that users can view''. I know that I can use the domain name with GitHub because that is provided in their service. The part about using GitHub in my package name is elaborating on the source code part (the package name is in the source code - i.e. it's pretty much a way to organize 'folders' in the Java programming language).Regarding GitHub's Terms of Service, do you know what general area I could find something like this? I tried looking at it (help.github.com\/en\/articles\/github-terms-of-service) but the section about GitHub Pages does not answer my question - I don't know if there is some other section that would usually have the answer to questions like mine? Well, actually I just found this: help.github.com\/en\/articles\/what-is-github-pages. And maybe this: . But I'm still a little confused...","answer":"Trademarks generally offer a few different protections.First, and most important, a trademark cannot be used in commerce without permission from the holder.  This means that a person cannot, while selling or advertising a product or service , use someone else's trademark without permission in a way that says or suggests that the product is the trademarked item, or made by the same person or firm as the trademarked item, or is endorsed, sponsored or approved by the trademark holder. If a consumer might reasonably be confused into believing any of those things incorrectly, the use of the trademark is an infringement. This protection only applies when the alleged infringer is selling or advertising something, so that the use is commercial.Secondly, one may not engage in trademark dilution. Using a trademarked name as a generic term for a class of items is usually dilution. The classic example is using 'Kleenex' to mean 'tissue' generically or using 'Xerox' to mean 'photocopy'.  'Aspirin', for example was once a US trademark of Bayer, but it was so diluted that it lost protection and is now a generic term for acetylsalicylic acid. The  says:  Bayer lost its trademark for Aspirin in the United States in 1918 because it had failed to use the name for its own product and had for years allowed the use of 'Aspirin' by other manufacturers. Today, aspirin is a generic trademark in many countries. Aspirin, with a capital 'A', remains a registered trademark of Bayer in Germany, Canada, Mexico, and in over 80 other countries, for acetylsalicylic acid in all markets, but using different packaging and physical aspects for each.Thirdly, one may not engage in trademark disparagement, using the trademark to ham the reputation of the product or its maker.  This is tricky, because one is allowed to express and publish reviews and opinions, even negative opinions of a product, and to identify the product by its trademarked name. A trademark holder cannot use trademark protection to suppress all negative comment about the product.A person (or firm) does not need permission to make Nominative use of a trademark. That means using the trademark to identify the trademarked item. However, such use must be done carefully to avoid any possible confusion or implication of sponsorship, endorsement or approval by the trademark holder. Specifically, one does not need permission to advertise compatibility. 'This replacement blade fits the SmoothGlide razor' id not an infringement, and does not require permission from the holder of the SmoothGlide  trademark.Also, one does not need permission for 'contrast' advertising. 'Our razor gives a 50% closer shave than SmoothGlide' does not require permission from the holder of the SmoothGlide  trademark.  Both compatibility and contrast statements are forms of nominative use. Use of logos or slogans is not usually required to identify the item, and may not be permitted without permission. It is good practice to include a disclaimer such as 'SmoothGlide is a trademark of Marcus Brands, inc. Marcus has not endorsed or approved QuickShave razors.' This heps avoid any possible consumer confusion.As described in the question, 'GitHub' is not used in advertising the OP's app, and nothing described could reasonably confuse anyone into believing that the App was by GitHub, nor that it was endorsed, approved, or sponsored by GitHub, or that the OP was associated with GitHub beyond having an account on GitHub. If that remains true when looking at the details, there does not seem to be a trademark problem, although a disclaimer such as 'Git Hub is a trademark of {entity}. GitHub has not endorsed or approved {Thisapp} in any way.' would be a good idea.  "}

The line, for product-purveyors, is drawn by  is an FDA warning letter to an Ayurvedic medical treatment maker \/ seller.There are ample law concerning practice of medicine, and there is the First Amendment which erects a strong barrier against laws which aim to prohibit people from disseminating an officially-unapproved viewpoint (to simplify matters, I presume  contrary to fact  that no medical authority has endorsed the specific efficacy of carrots). The government cannot punish you for taking approach A or B.If you have a license to practice medicine (of the relevant kind), you may be subject to state licensing-board sanctions for making unapproved claims (one of the factors that overrides the First Amendment). If you have no license, then the question is whether your activity falls within the realm of practicing medicine in the state. In Washington, the line is drawn via A person is practicing medicine if he or she does one or more of thefollowing: (1) Offers or undertakes to diagnose, cure, advise, orprescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity,deformity, pain or other condition, physical or mental, real orimaginary, by any means or instrumentality...Technically, you cannot advise a person to take an aspirin if they have a headache. However, this law is within the scope of business regulations, so part of the line not directly encoded in that definition (related to the requirement to have a license) is that you are doing this as a business.A person must have a state license in Washington to be a common school (K-12) teacher. Your gym teacher can tell you to eat carrots to cure your depression or whatever, and there is some (miniscule) chance that the teacher will get punished for giving such advice. A person does not have to have a license to be a university professor, therefore telling a student to eat carrots will lead to no government sanctions, though the employer may fire or reassign you, depending on circumstances. The crucial question is not whether you are advocating eating carrots, but what business you are engaged in, whereby in the course of that business you give advice. A person with a medical degree and license who is a greeter at Walmart is not subject to government sanctions for advising Eat carrots to cure your tumor \/ depression."}
{"question":"BACKGROUNDThe DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into United States federal law by President Barack Obama on July 21, 2010. Section 171 known as the Collins amendment states:Minimum risk-based capital requirements:The appropriate Federal banking agencies shall establish minimum risk-based capital requirements on a consolidated basis for insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors. The minimum risk-based capital requirements established under this paragraph shall not be less than the generally applicable risk-based capital requirements, which shall serve as a floor for any capital requirements that the agency may require, nor quantitatively lower than the generally applicable risk-based capital requirements that were in effect for insured depository institutions as of the date of enactment of this Act.I need to locate detailed guidance on calculation of the above mentioned risk based capital requirements.I found the below reference for Dodd Frank:Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, codified in relevant part at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301, \u00a7\u00a7 5481-5603, and in laws amended (Title X); and 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5481 note, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 note, \u00a7 1602, and \u00a7 1631 et seq. (Title XIV) I'm translating this as:Public Law number 111 to 203, statute 1376. Title 12 of the United States Code, chapters xx, etc.I understand that when a bill is signed into law by the President it is sent to the Office of the Federal Register to be assigned a law number and paginated for the United States Statutes at Large. Afterwards, a List of Public Laws is created, posted online, and then published in the Federal Register which I understand to be the official journal of the federal government of the United States that contains government agency rules, proposed rules, and public notices.USC Title 12 and Statute 1376 are very high level. No details\/guidance on the calculation of the floor that they rule on. No breakout of how credit risk, market risk, operational risk fit into the calculation for example. I'm currently reviewing the federal register but making very slow progress.QUESTIONSIs there a guidance manual such as the MPEP in Patent Law that accompanies USC Title 12?What is the next level of publications down? I am looking for publications with more detail and granular discussion of implementation of the laws in the USC and Statute.In Statute 1376, it's title is '124 STAT. 1376'. What does the 124 reference? Is that a grouping of Statutes? Banking for example? ","answer":"I found the below reference for Dodd Frank:  Pub. L.

(Title XIV)    I'm translating this as: Public Law number 111 to 203, statute 1376.  Title 12 of the United States Code, chapters xx, etc.The 111 stands for the 111th Congress (we are currently in the 114th). So it is the 203rd law passed in the 111th Congress. 124 Stat. 1376 is a volume (124) and page number (1376) of the first page of that statute in a series of dead tree books containing that public law. This public law amended the following sections of United States Code title 12: 5301, 5481-5603, 5481 note and all of Title X. There were also changes to United States Code title 15: \u00a7 1601 note, \u00a7 1602, and \u00a7 1631 et seq. (a.k.a. Title XIV).You should consider buying the current edition of 'The Bluebook' that explains all forms of legal citations and provides a list of the abbreviations used.The Federal Register actually only does regulations, but the Government Printing Office does what you say the Federal Register does. There is a parallel operation for laws to the one for regulations.There should be regulations interpreting this promulgated by the bodies assigned regulatory authority under the act first in the Federal Register and from there to the Code of Federal Regulations. You would look in the CFR and also in other publications of the agency, but secondary authority may be more useful. (For most banks, the agency is the FDIC, but some financial institutions that are covered are governed by other agencies with a similar mission.)There is a lot of secondary authority on this particular law and some of the guidance also flows from private sector accounting principles. The accounting principles are promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a non-profit run by CPAs.  Is there a guidance manual such as the MPEP in Patent Law that  accompanies USC Title 12?No."}
{"question":"Recently, i read the following article :.The example in this article :Fridgebook Inc.For the sake of illustration, say youre a fridge company Fridgebook  Inc. who markets intelligent fridges. Your fridges have a screen that  runs your proprietary application, and you use React for the UI.Overnight, you hear that Facebook decides to move into the fridge  industry, and theyve announced the worldwide launch of their new  product: FBfridge, in just 1 week.In the hypothetical case that Facebook blatantly infringes some of  your patents with FBfridge, what can you do?Well, you cannot sue them immediately. Youre using React on the  customer-facing app, remember?If you sue them before migrating to something else (like vue.js), you  will immediately lose the license grant for React, and suddenly youre  in breach yourself, fighting against a potential lawsuit for illegal  use of software, from an almost-$500-billion company, all by yourself.And obviously, you dont want to interrupt customer service.So if you want to sue them, or at least hold any leverage for doing  so, you will need to find a solution to migrate away from React in  record time.My question:Is the claim in that article accurate, and we have to go away from React to avoid Facebook laws ?","answer":"If you hold patents which you can imagine Facebook violating, then yes, you really need to avoid using React.The BSD + patents license says that if you sue Facebook for patent violation, that removes the license FB granted you to use their patents in React.There is actually another necessary condition before you need to move away from React: you have to believe that it would be uneconomic for your company to defend a patent infringement case from FB.  This is very likely; even if you could win in the end, the opportunity costs of the management time involved in defending such a case would be huge.  However the flip side is that even if FB violated your patents it might not be worth suing them - patent litigation is notoriously unpredictable.  If you don't think you would sue them, there is less point avoiding React (not 'no point', because the mere fact you are using React might make them more like to take the risk and violate your patent.)"}
{"question":"Contracts often include an \"entire agreement\" clause (a.k.a. \"integration\" or \"merger\" clause) like this:This contract contains the final and entire agreement and understanding between the Parties and is the complete and exclusive statement of its terms. This contract supersedes all prior agreement and understandings, whether oral or written, in connection therewith.This sounds like it would limit litigation regarding such an integrated contract to only (a) interpretations of the contract language or (b) factual questions of performance of the contract terms.However  claims:[U.K.?] case law has established four specific limitations to entire agreement clauses:Implied terms are not excludedLiability for misrepresentation is not excludedMistakes can still be rectifiedEstoppel by convention can still be invokedIs this a complete and correct list of exceptions that apply to integration clauses in U.S. jurisdictions?","answer":"Is this a complete and correct list of exceptions that apply to integration clauses in U.S. jurisdictions?No (neither it is for the UK or any other common law jurisdictions).No matter to what extent entire are the clauses, they never contract out of the underlying law (unless the law expressly allows so). Instead, contracts specify what the law does not.What that means is that there will always be terms that just come with the law and that contracts do not mention. Those 4 exceptions are just some examples. To get an idea of some more, one can just open a contract law course and see all those principles\/doctrines established in case law over centuries. Unless invalidated by statute, they still are perfectly valid for the purposes of litigation over contracts with  entire agreement clauses."}

{"question":"I'm a widowed artist. I have money in investments as a result of life insurance which I draw from when necessary - which with two kids is pretty much all the time. The investment income is under $10,000 (US) per year. Now, some artists make lots of money, but most make precisely zero dollars.I'm fine with this. But I can appreciate most women being like 'I'm not going to support some guy.' Fair enough; I support myself just fine, but whatever.What I'd like to know, for reference, is whether a woman receiving child support and alimony from a dissolution of marriage would have those sources of income reduced upon remarriage to a partner without an income (US). What about with investment-only income of, say, $5,000 per year?I realize this might be a case-by-case basis.","answer":"Short AnswerChild support does not change upon remarriage per se, although remarriage often results in a change of circumstances that does require a change in child support.Alimony often terminates upon the remarriage of the person receiving it, but not always. Usually, it does not terminate upon remarriage only when a separation agreement reached by the parties says that it doesn't terminate.Thus, generally speaking, a man's child support and alimony obligations will not be reduced because he has a new spouse and\/or her children in his household.Child SupportChild support does not change based upon marital status. It is a function of the income (of all types) of each of the parents, of extraordinary expenses of the child, and of overnights spent with each parent per year (it can also change if a child, perhaps one of several provided for in the child support award, is emancipated).Special rules apply when child support is owed to more than one co-parent (e.g. someone with two ex-wives and five children from a combination of each of the prior spouses and a current spouse).Critically, child support is not a function of the expenses of the parents or of the non-extraordinary expenses of the children.Income for child support purposes does not distinguish between earned income and investment income, or between taxed and untaxed income, and has a very broad definition of income that sometimes includes untaxed gifts. But, as a matter of policy, some child support laws disregard second or third jobs, or earned income in in addition to a full time job or full time combination of part-time jobs, when calculating child support.Income for child support purposes does not include a spouse's income.Child support obligations can be updated based upon a substantial change in these factors. So, unless the remarriage results in a change in income, in a child's extraordinary expenses, or in overnights spent, it isn't going to change child support.Also, income includes income imputed to a party where someone could work but chooses not to do so. So, if a remarried mother quit her good paying job when she remarried, she might not necessarily get a reduction in child support since she could have kept her job and chose to drop it instead.Obviously, this is an oversimplification, particularly with regard to imputed income. But, federal welfare statutes require states to have relatively similar child support laws for all but the most affluent people.AlimonyAlimony also known as maintenance or separate maintenance, historically terminated upon the remarriage of the person receiving it, or upon the death of either party to the former marriage. But, since this is not federally regulated (except with respect to its tax implications), it isn't as uniform among the states.Remarriage of the person paying maintenance is not historically a ground to reduce or change maintenance obligations.The majority rule is that the historic rule applies to remarriage in the case of court ordered maintenance that does not arise as a result of the agreement of the parties. But, the parties may, by agreement, provide that maintenance does not terminate upon remarriage.This applies only to maintenance payments due in the future. One cannot, for example, obtain a refund of a lump sum alimony payment that has been made already because the spouse who received it promptly remarried even though the lump sum alimony payment was set based upon assumptions by the judge that the spouse receiving it would not remarry for a long time.The minority and emerging rule is to allow courts to impose maintenance awards which are not terminated upon remarriage without an agreement of the parties to that effect. Another, basically opposite, minority rule is to forbid maintenance agreements where maintenance does not terminate upon remarriage. I don't have any good surveys at my disposal regarding which states follow which rule.There is quite a bit of variation between states regarding circumstances where de facto remarriage involving co-habitation, etc. amounts to remarriage even though the maintenance recipient is not legally remarried. Some states will treat this as a de facto remarriage, others will consider this to be the kind of change in circumstances that allows a maintenance award to be modified, and still others will ignore de facto remarriage entirely.In general, maintenance awards are much harder to modify than child support awards where modification is relatively routine when there is a change of circumstances. Usually, maintenance awards are made with consideration given to the income and broader economic circumstance of the parties when it is awarded, but is not a function of current income or expenses except to the extent that the original award because unconscionable or at least very unfair in the circumstances as they develop.One factor that could make a maintenance award unconscionable and subject to modification is the inability of the spouse obligated to pay it to pay.For example, support that the spouse obligated to pay maintenance was disabled and had a much reduced income a result - the maintenance award might be reduced.The obligation associated with supporting a new spouse for the person paying maintenance would very rarely be considered a change in circumstances requiring a change in the maintenance award.But, ultimately, this is a facts and circumstances test. I could imagine maintenance changing, if, for example, the new spouse was disabled and required extraordinary care that was costly in terms of both time and money, limiting the resources available to the person paying maintenance."}

{"question":"Two three year old children that agree on \"playing doctor\" and examining each others bodies, including genitalia are not committing a crime (but if one three year old child forces another three year old it is a crime, although it will be a case for the parents\/psychologist\/school counsellor not the police). Two 13 year old children\/adolescents that consent to have sex are not committing a crime (there are some weird exceptions, particularly in America, where holding a nude photo of yourself is considered child pornography but that is an exception). Furthermore, two 13 year olds can enter a contract if it is \"reasonable\" for their age, e.g., maybe \u20ac\/$ 30-50 or so.However, if one party in all those situations was 25, it would be illegal because children can't consent or enter binding contracts with an adult (for substantial amounts of money).Is the principle described above called something? How old is it? Did the Romans apply a similar concept? The medieval Catholic church?","answer":"In your first example this is a result of what's known as Age of Criminal Liability which is the minimum age one must be in order for the person to be held criminally liable for breeches of law (It depends on the jurisdiction in question, but typically 11 years old is the extreme high of the age while 7 is often the low end of the range.).  Two three year olds would not be criminally liable because they aren't developed enough to know better and thus shouldn't be jailed.The second example is called a Romeo and Juliet Exemption and generally permits teens who are relatively similar in age who engage in sexual behavior to not be guilty of statutory rape charges so long as 1.) Both parties are consenting. 2.) Neither party is in a trusted position of authority over the other (i.e. a Student Coach and a team member or Student Teacher with a Student) 3.) Neither is below a certain hard minimum age (usually 11).  The law is designed to prevent situations where one teen might be over Age of Consent but the other is not, even though they share a birth year.  There is room for age difference, but it's not absolute (there usually is a point where courts will say the gap is too wide).  Typically this is a protection enjoyed by the older partner in the relationship, as he\/she will be the one who would have issues with a relationship with the younger partner.I'm not sure on the nuances of Child Law contracts, but typically a parent or legal guardian may sign for a child under 18 unless said child is emancipated at a younger age, which requires a court order.Roman Law likely did not have similar age concerns as back when it existed, the age of adulthood was much lower (13 was typically an adult age, and you could certainly marry someone at that age) and the rights such as consent were not like to today's standards.   The patriarch of a household could have his children killed if he so desired.I can attest that the Catholic Church did and still does hold true to that very young children cannot commit sins, since all sins must be committed with the knowledge that they are sinful.   Typically the sacrament of Reconciliation (which is all about admitting to one's sins to receive forgiveness from them) is typically first given to someone when they are 7 to 8 if they are raised in the faith (The sacrament of Baptism covers Original Sin)."}

You don't have to provide an example, or a design, and it does not have to be patented. The applicant might be planning to license someone else's patent, or to market off-the-shelf tech not protected by patent. The applicant might be planning to market tech still under development and not yet ready to be submitted for a patent.I do not know Chinese trademark law, but I suspect it is similar in this regard. I have not heard of any country that requires a patent, a design, or an example of a working product along with a trademark registration. However, there is, in many countries, a requirement that actual sales occur within a limited period after the trademark is granted, and if this does not happen, the trademark registration may be canceled. The time allowed varies."}

Some countries look for 'where the crime has had an effect', for example if a criminal on the US side of the border shoots a person on the Canadian side, where this distinction might make a difference. Or gambling websites that are run outside the USA but used by people within the USA. But there is a large number of crimes outside the USA that the USA will prosecute; other countries have similar not identical rules. Examples are bribery by US companies outside the USA, certain sexual crimes. Usually covered are crimes that a nation just doesn't want its citizens to commit, even outside its own borders, to avoid damage to the countries reputation. The Amanda Knox case is clearly Italian business. Well, according to US law, it's not the business of the USA, and according to Italian law, it's Italy's business.

{"question":"Given that when a Plaintiff files an unlimited civil lawsuit with a US Superior Court, the name of the Plaintiff and the name of the first named defendant in the complaint are used to form the case name.  [Edit: Thank you to @ohwilleke for confirming\/clarifying this former assumption]However, after nearly half a year later, the case name is suddenly changed from being the Plaintiff and the first named Defendant to the Plaintiff and one of the other named Defendants in the complaint.In light of this, what sort of reason(s) might exist that could explain or justify why this change had suddenly occurred when taking into consideration the fact that no defendants were dismissed, no Plaintiff was added or removed, no new defendants were added or removed, no legal name changes had been made, no spelling mistakes had been identified, and no recent filings could be found that would otherwise explain why the case name had been suddenly changed?For example:Spongebob Squarepants, an individual, files a lawsuit against Patrick Star, an individual, Sandy Cheeks, an individual, and Pearl Krabs an individual, and The Krusty Krab, a California Corporation.The Case name assigned by the court upon the initial filing of the unlimited civil complaint is Spongebob Squarepants vs. Patrick Star et. al. and is the case name shown when accessing the case online, when viewing all submitted court filings up until the change and is seen used in all discovery requests and responses.Following yet another continued case management conference wherein no trial date has been set, suddenly when accessing the case online, a new case name is shown and reads Spongebob Squarepants vs. Pearl Krabs et. al. while Patrick Star, the named defendant that previously played a role in the case name, is still a party to the case along with all the other defendants.Alternatively, is it possible for one of the other defendants to request that the court not use their name for the case name and thus result in a sudden change being made without any sort of publicly viewable filing?[Edit: Question was revised and improved to rule out circumstances that would otherwise not apply.]Further elaborationI remember once upon a time a practicing attorney of 25 years telling me that once a case name has been assigned to a complaint, the case name would not be changed for any reason. So I was confused as to why this could've happened when I witnessed a case, suddenly without warning, started appearing under a different case name when searching for that same case number.This case had started out with the expected case name based on the Plaintiff and the first named Defendant of the complaint and was shown using that case name in all court documents, in all the initial filings, including the original complaint. But, at some unknown point in time, the case name was suddenly changed for that particular case number and one of the other listed defendants was suddenly being used for the case name even though no amended complaint or similar was filed.Is that something the Plaintiff could've done or perhaps one of the other named defendants?Again, as mentioned above, it would be as if all initial documents (such as the ones served), as well as how the case appeared on the LACourt website in the beginning was Spongebob Squarepants vs. Patrick Star et. al. and all of a sudden, 6 months after the Complaint was filed, the case name on the LACourt website suddenly changed and became Spongebob Squarepants vs. Patrick Star et. al. when searching for the case number and being reported with the new case name..Former Due DiligenceWhen attempting to do a search on case naming, search results kept assuming I was referring to making legal name changes rather than being able to find any laws or text about how a case name is determined and I was only able to find  which explained which name comes first in a case name (the party that files the initial complaint).","answer":"There are several reasons that case name might change. Here are twelve of them, roughly in order of frequency:A party is dismissed from the case and hence is no longer a party, so the next person in line becomes the first party listed in the caption.There are several defendants, only some of whom appeal, and only the parties that actually appeal are included in the caption in the appeal. This also happens when not all parties who are part of an initial appeal are parties to a later case in the state supreme court or U.S. Supreme Court because the issues upon which certiorari review were granted only pertain to some parties.A government official or trustee of a trust is sued by name in their official capacity and when the occupant of that office changes, the caption is amended to reflect the new occupant of that office.An entity's name changes during the course of the case, either due to a rebranding (e.g. X formerly known as Twitter) or due to a corporate merger or acquisition, or both.The case is consolidated with another related lawsuit and the other lawsuit is given top billing in the consolidated case caption.A party dies or is legally declared incompetent and their executor or conservator or guardian is substituted as a party.The original caption was inconsistent with the body text of the complaint, or is otherwise misidentified, and the caption is amended to correct the error (e.g. someone erroneously captions the case as against Apple Industries when the lawsuit is against Apple Computer or puts J.D.

Squarepants vs. Krabs (this often happens in the case of appeals where only some parties appeal at each level, or where an official party defendant changes mid-case). The linked definition states that this term is only used when the name changes in a different court, but this term is also used when a case name changes in the middle the same case in the same court  to refer to rulings made when the case had a different name.a primary defendant is somehow chosen (presumably whomever thePlaintiff has listed first in their complaint, I'm guessing?)Correct. But sometimes in appellate case law, if one party is a very common litigant, the very short (single party) version of the case name will be the name of a party that is not a common litigant.For example, Brown v. Board of Education is usually referred to in very short form as Brown and this probably would have happened even if the fuller case caption had been Board of Education v. Brown."}
{"question":"Can a civilian pull his vehicle, to the side of the road, and walk back to a police vehicle? The police vehicle didn't have lights on; nor initiate the stop. The police car followed the vehicle, making several turns, and seems to be following the vehicle. Can the civilian ask the officer, if he is following the vehicle? The street last turned onto is leaving the city, only going to a country area, beyond the city cop's jurisdiction.This happened in the state of West Virginia.","answer":"A Civilian can certainly ask the police officer whether the officer is following the civilian, and if so why. But, at least in the US, the civilian cannot demand an answer. That is, the police officer has no legal obligation to answer the question, nor to answer truthfully if an answer is given.Some officers might take exception to even a polite question, and might take lawful or unlawful action against the asker.It would be wise not to act in any way that the officer might see as threatening. In particular, approaching the officer with hands in pockets or hidden would be unwise.One could also call the local emergency dispatch (9-1-1 in the US) both to verify that the car is in fact a police car, not a imposter, and to ask why one is being followed. Criminals have been known to use imitation police cars to get civilians to stop. If safe, such a call can be mad without stopping."}
{"question":"The dispute: mold and crack in a common bath tub shared by multiple users. Landlord refuses to return deposit until tenant pay for a replacement of bath tub including professional installation.Signed lease agreement: none. Only some emails.Venue is White Plains, NY, USI moved in 21 Apr and moved out 18 Nov 2017. Until now landlord has not returned my $750 deposit.According to landlord, the bath tub was spotless when I moved in, but I could see it had been in use for at least 5 years. There was already another tenant in the other guest room when I moved in. My room had been used by Landlord's son. All of these occupants have only one bath tub to share.A few months later we noticed minor mold in the bathtub. Landlord insisted (by email) that the other current tenant (Zuhur) and I restore it to the original condition, using our own money to pay for two thirds of the total cost.Theres no ventilation to prevent mold, but there are many wet objects in the bath room creating moisture.The crack became visible to everyone a few days after I moved in, when there was another short-term tenant + me sharing the common bathtub. No idea who caused it, but there's a clue -- the plastic (not ceramic) bathtub lacked solid support underneath, so much so that any adult standing on it would notice the base sinking down. This was noticed by all tenants I have spoken to. The wife of the landlord confirmed that the installation was not perfect and missed the support beneath the tub. Unfortunately no one is willing to provide written witness. This crack is probably the main reason for the replacement, even though the landlord has always mentioned it as a second 'problem' to be fixed -- his emails always singles out the mold as the primary problem.In Dec 2017, landlord finally fixed the bathtub. He didn't treat the mold but instead replaced the entire bathtub and sent me a bill over $3000. I replied to say let court decided how much I should pay. Landlord then counter-sued me for $5000 damage to his property.As to the 'ordinary cost of repairs', for mold it should be a few hundred dollars. Total area of mold added up to less than my thumb fingernail. For the crack, total cost is the replacement cost, probably $1000+ rather than the $3000 bill he sent me.","answer":"Your rights and responsibilities in this realm are a matter of local law, sometimes down to the level of the city, plus whatever is stipulated in the lease.

The landlord duties also require the landlord to  Keep any shared or common areas reasonably clean, sanitary, and safe  from defects increasing the hazards of fire or accidentso in Washington, it's his problem and not yours.In general, even if a tenant is responsible for some form of cleanup, that does not constitute legal license for a facility upgrade. It might cost a couple hundred dollars to hire a person to wash ordinary mold accumulation, and does not justify getting a $5,000 new tub. Since this is in a common area, you would not be solely liable for whatever the damage was.The part where you say 'crack in a common bath tub' is a large red flag: it suggests to me that somebody negligently broke the bathtub, and then caused behind-the-wall damage by letting water infiltrate without notifying the landlord. If you broke the tub and let it rot, you could be liable. If the tub was broken already and the landlord didn't bother to do anything about it, that is his negligence.The three questions that you should try to answer are: (1) what are the duties of landlord and tenant in my jurisdiction, (2) what was the actual harm done, and who did it, (3) what is the ordinary cost of whatever repair was done."}
{"question":" XKCD comic jokingly suggest training wildlife to harass people playing music too loud in their car:I'm pretty sure no one is actually considering a solution like this, but it made me curious what would happen if someone tried it.  I'd consider training wildlife to harass individuals to be generally antisocial, even if they were playing annoying music, and conditioning to harass someone who is driving when it could potentially lead to an accident would be doubly so.  Thus it would presumably be something the government, and thus legal system, would want to discourage.  The question is rather the legal system has any rules about this particular situation.

There are obvious forms of selection (i.e. based on race) that are unconstitutional: where is the 'bright line'?","answer":"State governments, in general, have very broad legislative authority. Surely, a state legislature can pass a law prohibiting a private business or local government agency from requiring a vaccine passport, so long as it is not pre-empted by federal law or federal regulations.It is very unlikely to be unconstitutional under the federal constitution. Conceivably, there is a  concern, but state government has virtually absolute federal constitutional authority over local governments. And, precedents for similarly intrusive regulations of businesses engaged in general retail sales to the public are there, even though for non-businesses or businesses that are not public accommodations that serve the general public, there might be a freedom of association concern.It is also unlikely that the regulation would offend the state constitution, although it is barely possible that the Florida state constitution might have some intrastate federalism type provision that prohibited state government from imposing this kind of order on a local government.This doesn't mean that the Department of Health actually has the authority to issue these kinds of regulations. Its regulatory power is to issue emergency mandates to prevent the spread of disease, not to take actions with no medical or public health basis that impairs the ability to fight infectious diseases. This regulation very likely exceeds the agency's authority under Florida statutes, and furthermore, it probably doesn't even pass a  as a regulation passed under that authority (even if it might pass a rational basis test if enacted by the state legislature).I'm not aware of any current conflict with a federal statute or regulation. For the most part this kind of rule is not contemplated and federal law is silent on them. But, the CDC almost surely has the authority to enact a regulation which would prohibit Florida from imposing an anti-vaccination passport requirement on private businesses (although, for federalism reasons, it might very well not be able to do so in the case of state and local governments, although it could condition grants on not having such a regulation).As a famous justice once said, the constitution does not prohibit passing stupid laws, even though it does impose some limitations on the kinds of laws that may be enacted."}

{"question":"We recently signed a 1 year lease for a house. A realtor was representing the landlord. We moved in about 2 months ago.At the time of move-in, the realtor gave a walk-through of the house and filled a form documenting all damages. We asked a copy of the filled form, but he said we can take another 1 week to find other problems and he would add that to the form and send us the final one. It has been 2 months and he still has not returned us the form. We have requested him multiple times via email, text and phone call. Also, the rent includes a pass to the condominium amenities which he has not given us yet despite several attempts to request one. Finally, there is a bathroom with a broken toilet bowl which we found out in the first couple weeks (since this house has multiple bathrooms we did not use this for a while). Again, he has not fixed it despite several requests.What are my options now? Is there a way I can make a new move-in inspection sheet with all the damages documented and attested by lawyer or something.

You will keep the original in case the matter ends up in court. Unless the realtor gets up to speed with his promise for an inspection, your notarized letter insofar as evidence is much likelier to outweigh the realtor's after-the-fact, bare allegations.You mention that there is already some tension in your relationship with the realtor.

{"question":"In World War II, Executive Order 9066 suspended basic rights of Japanese Americans - even people whose loyalty to the United States was never questioned, though the government feared the group as a whole might contain some spies - and led to a lot of people (>100K) being rounded up and kept at internment camps.  Korematsu v. United States ruled this was constitutional.Today, in the 'War on Terror,' at least one politician can make surprisingly strong statements about plans for negative treatment against large groups of people (e.g. Muslims) because of concerns that a small minority of them might be radical enough to kill a bunch of people, and [the politician can] remain surprisingly popular.Supposing such a candidate were elected President, could that President do something like Executive Order 9066 again today?  If not, specifically why not, citing what's changed about the US constitution between WWII and now to prevent that? Answers that just say 'no political leader would try that because it'd be so unpopular' are not satisfactory answers to the question and not consistent with the evidence of what happened before and what is happening in present polls.  ","answer":"WWII Supreme Court CasesDuring WWII, the Supreme Court dealt with three main issues in their cases on Executive Order 9066: curfews, exclusions, and internment of persons with Japanese ancestry.In the lesser-known  in providing for due process of law in times of war. In the end, the court decided that a curfew was indeed justified.Following this, the majority of the court found in , that the exclusion of those with Japanese ancestry from certain military zones (in this case, the West coast) was also constitutional. In their decision, they heavily relied upon the Hirabayashi case.The question of internment of people with Japanese ancestry was not actually decided constitutionally. Another case, a habeas corpus case,  might have resolved it, but the Court concluded this case in favor of Endo without going to the constitutional level. A day before this decision was announced, the government suspended Executive Order 9066, leaving the question unresolved.In these cases, Justice Frank Murphy's opinions stand out. In Hirabayashi, he sternly warned of the racism involved, but felt that the curfew was indeed justified. However, in Korematsu, he evidently felt that the exclusion was without basis and dissented, calling the majority opinion legalization of racism.Current LawIn theory, these cases still stand. This is because they haven't been explicitly overruled, and the changes to the constitution since Hirabayashi aren't relevant: Amendments XXII and XXV have to do with procedural issues with the office of the President, amendments XXIII, XIV, and XXVI are related to voting rights, and XXVII addresses Congressional salaries. The constitution for the purpose of a similar order is thus unchanged, and so should theoretically be covered under Korematsu &amp; Hirabayashi.However, its effective status as precedent is shaky. For one, it has been widely condemned, and courts would likely avoid using Korematsu &amp; Hirabayashi if possible, or attempt to make a distinction from them given a slightly different order. Second, the convictions against Korematsu and Hirabayashi were overturned in the 1980s based on evidence being possibly concealed by the government. This was  by the Department of Justice in 2011. However, this is an error of fact, and as such the ratio decidendi (legal reasoning) used would still technically stand as precedent.Lengthy Update: The Supreme Court has since declared Korematsu incorrect in . However in doing so, the court explicitly distinguished the two cases. Thus, many consider the declaration to be obiter dictum, i.e. an aside that is non-precedential. I'll quote the relevant portion so that readers may decide for themselves:Finally, the dissent invokes Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 65 S.Ct. 193, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944). Whatever rhetorical advantage the dissent may see in doing so, Korematsu has nothing to do with this case. The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority. But it is wholly inapt to liken that morally repugnant order to a facially neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the privilege of admission. [...]The dissent's reference to Korematsu, however, affords this Court the opportunity to make express what is already obvious: Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, andto be clearhas no place in law under the Constitution.Additionally further muddying the issue is that the judgment directly moves from referencing Korematsu to referencing concentration camps. But as noted above, Korematsu dealt with exclusion, not internment in concentration camps as is often popularly believed (though Murphy's &amp; Roberts's dissents dispute the distinction so the Trump v. Hawaii judgment may implicitly be validating this). Korematsu paragraph 20:It is said that we are dealing here with the case of imprisonment of a citizen in a concentration camp solely because of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his loyalty and good disposition towards the United States. Our task would be simple, our duty clear, were this a case involving the imprisonment of a loyal citizen in a concentration camp because of racial prejudice. Regardless of the true nature of the assembly and relocation centersand we deem it unjustifiable to call them concentration camps with all the ugly connotations that term implieswe are dealing specifically with nothing but an exclusion order.Future ChallengesIf another such order occurred, it would almost certainly reach the Supreme Court. The Court would then have to adhere to, reconcile with, or overrule Korematsu &amp; Hirabayashi. In Hirabayashi, the following key piece of reasoning was given (and quoted in Korematsu):Whatever views we may entertain regarding the loyalty to this country of the citizens of Japanese ancestry, we cannot reject as unfounded the judgment of the military authorities and of Congress that there were disloyal members of that population, whose number and strength could not be precisely and quickly ascertained. We cannot say that the war-making branches of the Government did not have ground for believing that in a critical hour such persons could not readily be isolated and separately dealt with, and constituted a menace to the national defense and safety, which demanded that prompt and adequate measures be taken to guard against it.Regardless of personal beliefs, it is hard to argue the logic behind this particular statement (mainly because it is so broad, in my opinion). However, these prompt and adequate measures would still have to be weighed against the Fifth Amendment. Additionally, we now have a historical example of what may happen if race-based exclusion were allowed, and this could inform the justices' decision.A completely different way that such an order could be ruled unconstitutional could be through separation of powers violations. It could be ruled that Congress  the powers expressed in Executive Order 9066, but this is rare. It was mentioned in Hirabayashi, but the court did not consider this issue, saying that since Congress agreed with the order, this point was moot.ConclusionThough the letter of the law suggests that another order like Executive Order 9066 is possible, in practice it would face significant hurdles. Such an order would likely face challenges based on the Fifth Amendment and almost certainly make its way to SCOTUS. Then, it would be up to them to decide.I'll end with this  from the late Justice Antonin Scalia:Well, of course, Korematsu was wrong [...] But you are kidding yourself if you think the same thing will not happen again."}

{"question":"This question revolves around the (unresolved) question in the open source community, whether 'dynamic linking' against a GPL-licensed library requires your software to be GPL-licensed, as well. I will first give some background on the GPL \/ copyleft, and then some technical background. Third, I give a concrete example of a program in which the problem arises. Finally, I try to formulate the actual question. Feel free to skip the first two or three sections.Since jurisdiction often matters: I live in Germany, but would also be interested in how this plays out in US law.GPL \/ CopyleftOne populare software license is the GPL ('General Public License'). The GPL is a copyleft licence, i.e., it contains the passage that any software 'based on' the GPL-licensed software must also be GPL-licensed. There seems to be an agreement that this can be reformulated to 'any derivative work' (although the term 'derivative' does not appear in the license itself). One major open question is when exactly software A is 'based on' software B (or a 'derivative' of software B). Technical Background: Dynamic LinkingAlmost all programs we use are not written 'in one piece', but rather pull in many reusable pieces of software, so-called libraries. The way these libraries are 'pulled in' is often termed linking. There are two fundamentally different ways of linking: Static and dynamic linking. In static linking, the software library as a whole is copied into the program during translation from source code to an executable program. The software library is thus physically part of the binary program you distribute.In dynamic linking, the binary programm instead contains a reference to the library. Think of it as a marker in the program that says 'at this point in the program, execute function xyz from library abc'. When you run the program, your operating system looks up library abc, loads it into memory, and when the main program reaches the marker, program execution jumps to the program code of function xyz in library abc.A simple, yet complete exampleThis example constitutes a complete Python program that could be distributed as written (with a few omissions) here. Say I have a file the_program.py containing:from the_library import some_functionsome_function()This is a complete, runnable python program that does nothing but execute the function some_function from some hypothetic python library the_library. If I send you this (plain text) file via e-mail and you have python and the_library on your computer, you can run it.Of course, python programs are usually not distributed via e-mail but rather via some central repository (mainly 'PyPi'). To do that, I create a second file called setup.py, roughly containing:setup(  name='my_program',  install_requires='the_library')I would then upload these two files (and nothing else) to such a repository. If you wanted to install my program, you would (in some automatic fashion via a packet manager) download the two files, and the setup.py file tells your packet manager that it also needs to download and install the_library for my program to work. that I need to license my two files above under the GPL (assuming that the_library is a GPL-licensed library), since it is a 'derivative' of the_library. Note that at no point do I myself distribute any part of the_library. All I (resp. my code) does is include a pointer that says 'you need the_library to run this'. To spin this further: I could have written my program without ever downloading or seeing any part of the_library myself. That I can do that is obvious: I was able to write above code without the hypothetical library the_library even existing, and of course I could also upload this code to a package repository.The QuestionIn my understanding, a software license constitutes a contract between the person providing the software and the person accepting the license to download\/use the software. However, since I can build my software without ever interacting with (i.e., downloading, installing, using, \u2026) the GPL-licensed library myself, how can I have accepted a contract with the authors of the library? If such a contract has not been closed, how can I be bound by it to license my software in any way?'But that does never really happen!'One might argue that in practice, I will never be able to write a software that dynamically links to some library without actually using that library myself to test my program, figure out how the library works, etc. Thus, in practice, I will always have accepted the license of the library while installing it.However, because of this peculiarity of GPL-licensed libraries, there are replacements for some of them being developed. People try to create other (less restrictively licensed) libraries with the same interface and the same functionality, which can act as a drop-in replacement.I might now develop my software with such a replacement, but still offer the user of the software the possibility to install the 'original' instead of the replacement. Maybe the original is faster, or safer, or just ships with more operating systems. Thus, the case 'I never interacted with the GPL-licensed code, but they still require me to abide by their terms' does in fact arise in practice.","answer":"In the USA, the GPL license is a license, not a contract. It allows you to do certain things that would be copyright infringement if you did them without a license, as long as you follow the license terms. You cannot be sued for breach of contract, but for copyright infringement.In Germany, the GPL license is considered a contract. The US argument that a one sided contract without considerations is invalid doesnt apply in Germany, so this is fine. Its a strange contract because one side doesnt require any evidence that you agreed to the contract. If a case about GPL licensed software went to court, the judge could ask you did you accept the license and the answer would determine whether you are accused of copyright infringement or breach of contract.In the USA, you dont accept the GPL license. It just tells you what things you are allowed to do under which condition, beyond what copyright law allows you to do anyway. You can be sued for copyright infringement, and the questions then are: did you do something not within the rights you have due to copyright law? If no, you are not guilty. Did the GPL license give you permission? If not, guilty. Did you follow the conditions of the GPL license? Yes, not guilty. No, guilty.Due to comments: In the USA, accepting the license is like accepting a present, it doesn't give you any obligations to do something. But you can get into a situation where you have the choice between following the terms in the license and committing copyright infringement. Now Microsoft might have three lines of GPL licensed code in Word. They have the choice between publishing all of Word with a GPL license, or paying say $10,000 for copyright infringement - you can guess what they will do. If I used a huge GPL licensed library in my hobby project, I'd publish my hobby project under the GPL license to avoid getting prosecuted. I assume your company is somewhere in between."}
{"question":"Is there a single authoritative copy of the Constitution, i.e. if it contradicted every other copy, it would prevail in a court? For the original articles, the original copy would be the obvious choice, but it doesn't include amendments.","answer":"The :the only constitutional law treatise formally authorized by federal law, the Constitution Annotated functions as the official Constitution of recordWhat version is authoritative can be meaningful.

The text as shown in the Constitution Annotated is what is universally accepted as the version to quote from in judicial submissions and reasons.

To what extent is this true, and how applicable is to the whole of the USA? Does it cover both civil and criminal actions or just one or anothor","answer":"An example of where this is not allowed is Seattle, WA. Municipal code  states   It is unlawful for any person to intentionally fight with another  person in a public place and thereby create a substantial risk of:      Injury to a person who is not actively participating in the fight; or  Damage to the property of a person who is not actively participating in the fight.

In any prosecution under subsection A of this Section 12A.06.025,  it is an affirmative defense that:      The fight was duly licensed or authorized by law; or  The person was acting in self-defense.  You can see from adjacent sections that 'mutual combat' is not legal. I recognize that there is this meme about Seattle, but this is a distortion of an incident when the police turned a blind eye to a fight. We have police issues, no doubt: there is nothing legal about such fights. Of course, for a licensed event, you can 'fight'.Of course the potential legality depends on how mutual combat is defined.  define it thus:  Mutual combat is a fight or struggle which both parties enter  willingly or where two persons, upon a sudden quarrel and in hot  blood, mutually fight upon equal terms and where death results from  the combat.Similar death-definitions are found in .

{"question":"I've heard that keeping seeds is illegal. What do I need to do to keep them\/distribute them to stay legal?I heard about it in this video from someone with a huge gardening following: ","answer":"There are such laws throughout the US, but I will focus on Pennsylvania where the regulators caused a problem. The  which incorrectly states that 'The Pennsylvania Seed Act requires all distributors of seed to purchase a seed license'. (See below why this does not mesh with the law). They then say  All Seed being distributed in Pennsylvania must be labeled according  to the PASeed Act and Regulations. This includes, but not limited to,  such things as Germination Test date, Sell by date, lot #,Seed Kind,  distributor's name and addressThe law itself says  It shall be unlawful to sell, offer for sale, expose for sale or  transport any seed subject to the provisions of this chapter for  seeding purposes in bulk, packages or containers unless the package or  container in which the same shall be exposed or offered for sale or  transported shall have attached thereto, in a conspicuous place on the  exterior thereof, a tag or label on which shall be plainly and legibly  written or printed in English the following information relating to  the seed.Since as I understand the library just holds seed and distributes it, they are not selling or transporting, so while the library is required to obtain a license, they are not required to engage in the testing.The gardener who brings in the seed would have to transport the seed. So it does appear that gardeners are violating the law. There is a bit of a legal bind here. The first thing that the law requires be included on the label is 'the name and address of the distributor who labeled the seed'. To determine whose name is to appear on the package, we must look to the definition of 'distributor', which is 'The person whose name appears on the label of seed'. This is pretty simple, then: if there is no name on the label, then there is no distributor. The gardener transporting the seed to the library must attach a label, and if they include a name and address then they become a distributor by the act of including the name and address. The gardener must also include 'a treatment statement as prescribed by the secretary in the regulations', plus information in germination tests performed.About the license requirement. The law does not require a license of everyone who distributes seed: it says  Every person functioning as a distributor of seed in this  Commonwealth shall, on or before January 1 of each year or prior to  distribution, apply for and obtain an annual license for each legal  entity. Each distributor shall complete a form furnished by the  department and pay a $25  application fee.Since 'distributor' is defined in the definitions section as being the guy with the name on the label, then the distributor is not the person who distributes. It is the guy whose name and address are on the label. So check whose name and address are on the label. Similar statutes probably exist in all states, so here's the . There is a subtle difference between the states: in Washington, restrictions are on 'transport for sale', and in Pennsylvania it is simply 'transport'. "}

Today it was announced that the senate will be on break for a few days due to several corona cases.

Sometimes there are optional surveys that you may complete as well (e.g. regarding salaries and hours worked and type of practice and disability status).If you fail to comply with these registration requirements after receiving warnings to do so, your license to practice law is suspended. The conditions upon which your license can be reinstated and the process for doing so varies from state to state.Exceptions to the usual rules often exist if you primarily practice law in another state, you are on inactive status for some reason, or you are retired.Generally speaking, to keep your license current, you don't have to take new exams regarding the practice of law or legal ethics, and you generally don't have to complete the comprehensive background check called character and fitness review that is necessary to be admitted to the practice of law in the first place."}

When a claim is asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may bring in a third party if this rule would allow a defendant to do so.","answer":"The Plaintiff can't implead a third party. If the Plaintiff amends its complaint to join a new party to the case, that new party is a defendant, and as such, may assert counterclaims against the Plaintiff and crossclaims against any co-defendant in the case.Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 14 applies to third-party complaints brought by defendants who sue third-parties, not to first party complaints brought by plaintiffs against newly joined parties.FRCP 14(a)(2)(B) provides that the Third-Party Defendant may bring counterclaims against the defendant who filed the Third-Party Complaint.FRCP 14(a)(2)(C) and(D) provides that the Third-Party Defendant may bring claims against and assert affirmative defenses against the Plaintiff who sued the Third-Party Defendant, even though the Plaintiff didn't itself sue the Third-Party Defendant.There is a question upon which FRCP 14 is silent, however. Can a third-party defendant in a case brought by a defendant\/third-party plaintiff bring claims against co-defendants of the defendant\/third-party plaintiff that sued the third-party defendant?The rule does not expressly authorize such a quasi-cross-claim. But, in practice, by hook or by crook, most federal court judges would allow a third-party defendant to do so by some means, although without so prolonged research I couldn't tell you exactly how that would be justified.Perhaps, the third-party defendant would bring a (second order) third-party complaint against other defendants in the case.

{"question":"Title pretty much says it all, my friend had a kid with a girl at 16 (she was 19), and recently, she up and left him. She's still in the state, and their ages are 17 & 20 respectively now. Looking through state laws regarding how custody works, I can find no mention of dealing with minors, so my question is if minors do have rights to children they had, to begin with.The primary law I'm looking at to try and help is NH RSA 461-A:6, some pertinent text from the law is as follows:I. In determining parental rights and responsibilities, the court shall be guided by the best interests of the child, and shall consider the following factors:  (a) The relationship of the child with each parent and the ability of each parent to provide the child with nurture, love, affection, and guidance.  (b) The ability of each parent to assure that the child receives adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and a safe environment.  (c) The child's developmental needs and the ability of each parent to meet them, both in the present and in the future.  (d) The quality of the child's adjustment to the child's school and community and the potential effect of any change.  (e) The ability and disposition of each parent to foster a positive relationship and frequent and continuing physical, written, and telephonic contact with the other parent, including whether contact is likely to result in harm to the child or to a parent.  (f) The support of each parent for the child's contact with the other parent as shown by allowing and promoting such contact, including whether contact is likely to result in harm to the child or to a parent.  (g) The support of each parent for the child's relationship with the other parent, including whether contact is likely to result in harm to the child or to a parent.  (h) The relationship of the child with any other person who may significantly affect the child.  (i) The ability of the parents to communicate, cooperate with each other, and make joint decisions concerning the children, including whether contact is likely to result in harm to the child or to a parent.  (j) Any evidence of abuse, as defined in RSA 173-B:1, I or RSA 169-C:3, II, and the impact of the abuse on the child and on the relationship between the child and the abusing parent.  (k) If a parent is incarcerated, the reason for and the length of the incarceration, and any unique issues that arise as a result of incarceration.  (l) The policy of the state regarding the determination of parental rights and responsibilities described in RSA 461-A:2.  (m) Any other additional factors the court deems relevant.I have been unable to find in this law or others how the situation is dealt with if one of the parents is a minor, but my friend mentioned that they had been court ordered for mediation, so I would assume they at least treat a minor somewhat like a non-minor in this circumstance. Any further information would be much appreciated.","answer":"The applicable state law is . Section 461-A:2 guides the interpretation of the chapter:  I. Because children do best when both parents have a stable and  meaningful involvement in their lives, it is the policy of this state,  unless it is clearly shown that in a particular case it is detrimental  to a child, to:    (a) Support frequent and continuing contact between each child and  both parents.    (b) Encourage parents to share in the rights and responsibilities of  raising their children after the parents have separated or divorced.    (c) Encourage parents to develop their own parenting plan with the  assistance of legal and mediation professionals, unless there is  evidence of domestic violence, child abuse, or neglect.    (d) Grant parents and courts the widest discretion in developing a  parenting plan.    (e) Consider both the best interests of the child in light of the  factors listed in RSA 461-A:6 and the safety of the parties in  developing a parenting plan.    II. This chapter shall be construed so as to promote the policy stated  in this section.The law gets no more specific than to refer to the fact of being a parent. The law does not favor males over females, or vice versa, and the law does not discriminate between a parent who is a minor versus a parent who is a legal adult. The rights of parents are equal, ab initio. However, the recognition of the rights of a father does depend on the legal establishment of paternity whereas the law takes maternity to be self-evident. This may have been dealt with at birth, or may require a  if paternity is contested. If that part is sorted out, then disagreements about custody etc. which can't be worked out through agreement possibly with a mediator can be resolved in court. The court will determine what constitutes the 'best interests of the child'.That is all there is to it, legally. That does not mean that a judge making a decision is absolutely immune from thinking that the minor father is less able take care of the child. , a minor can seek emancipation, but until then (and until there is emancipation), the minor's parent have veto power over the father's wishes."}

{"question":"Can sharing an image on social media without attribution or permission be considered as being fair use? For example, let's say you're posting the image of an eagle by someone, but you don't credit him and you don't get permission from him, but you identify what kind of eagle it is. Could this be considered fair use since like an encyclopedia you're effectively teaching what an eagle looks like, and what are the requirements to make that educational claim valid? Does it make a difference if the images are under creative commons?","answer":"It DependsIf the person reusing the image (lets call that person R for reuser) is not complying with the terms of the Creative commons license, which include a requirement to provide attribution of the source work, then R cannot rely on the license, and the granting of the license ad the presence of a license declaration is legally irrelevant.R must have some other basis to reuse the image. This could be an exception to copyright, such as fair use or fair dealing. Or possibly the image is not protected by copyright, for example because its copyright has expired,  or because it is a work of the US Federal Government being used in the US.  In the absence of such a basis, R is infringing copyright.In much of the world copyright now lasts for 70 years after the death of the author (or of all co-authors). In some different terms apply, ranging from life+50 to life+100. Sound recordings and photos get shorter terms in some countries.In the US the term is life+70 for recent works, but for work created and published before 1978 more complex rules apply, depending on the date of publication, and whether laws on notice and renewal were complied with. See the well-known chart  for the various cases and when copyright expires in each case.The question asks about fair use. This is a US-specific legal concept. It is designed to be flexible, an is highly fact-dependent. As a result it is rarely possible to say if a use will qualify as a fair use with certainty until a court passes on it. See  for more on fair use.Not providing attribution is itself often considered to weigh against fair use. The question does not give enough detail to make even a good guess as to whether such a use is likely to be held to be fair use. Identifying the kind of eagle has some educational value, which might favor fair use to some extent, but must be considered in light of the overall purpose of the use, which is not described. There is no indication as to whether the original work is creative or factual, or whether the reuse would be likely to harm the market for the original. Much use of images on social media does not stand up under a fair use analysis. Providing proper attribution might well help any fair use claim.See also  "}

The company needs to know who the owners of record are for lots of practical purposes like knowing where to send dividend checks and notices of owner meetings, and tax compliance. But the public doesn't in most cases.C corporations are more private, because if you don't pay dividends, you don't need to know who the members are for many tax purposes, whereas the IRS has to be told every year who the owners of passthrough taxed entities are.Most states require at least a registered agent but many states allow a registered agent to be an entity (something that some states require a license for and others do not) and some allow a company's principal office to be its registered office with it serving as registered agent for itself. Those states usually allow for service of process by mail in those cases. If determining ownership was necessary, the entity could be served with process by whatever means are authorized by state law with a subpoena.Some states require that at least one manager or officer or director name be disclosed publicly, but there is probably a 50-50 split on that. Many do not.It  you must disclose the organizers of an LLC (who don't have to have any ongoing role in the entity - for example, it could be a lawyer who drew up the paperwork), and a registered agent (which may be an entity), but not owners, managers or officers.There is international pressure for the U.S. to pass a law or enter into a treaty requiring ownership disclosure, in order to discourage illicit use of these entities, but it doesn't seem to be going anywhere."}

Ohio, 360 U.S. 423 (1959), stand for the proposition that a defendant may not be punished for actions taken in good faith reliance upon authoritative assurances that he will not be punished for those actions.If the U.S. Department of Justice (or a U.S. Attorney with jurisdiction over the place the offense was committed) (hereinafter DOJ) says this, people who reasonably rely on that pronouncement can't be prosecuted until a different policy is announced and people who acted in reliance on the previous DOJ position are given a reasonable opportunity to change their conduct in response to the newly announced policy. The statement does have to be a publicly announced policy (or a policy personally communicated to the defendant or his counsel), and not just a de facto reality in terms of prosecutions not being brought in the past, or a secret, unannounced policy (or, for example, an unofficial and offhand statement of the U.S. Attorney General at a party that does not amount to a policy statement).Of course, the defense doesn't protect you if the DOJ says it won't prosecute if you do X, but you do X times Y which goes beyond the safe harbor created by the DOJ pronouncement.For example, the DOJ might say that they will not prosecute conduct involving marijuana offenses that is legal under state law, if it does not violate any other laws, and also meets certain conditions found in federal law (e.g. no offenses within 1000 feet of a school) that the DOJ chooses not to refrain from enforcing.But, if the DOJ then publicly says that it will start enforcing federal law without exceptions on July 1, 2021 and has rescinded its prior policy, a reasonable time in advance, then this defense ceases for conduct after that date. What constitutes reasonable notice would depend upon the facts and circumstances.The DOJ can also reach a binding agreement not to prosecute a particular instance of conduct by a particular person irrevocably in connection with plea bargaining type agreements, with respect to offenses of which the DOJ has jurisdiction (but not necessarily prosecutions by a different government such as a state government or the government of another country, for which the DOJ is not an authorized representative).For example, suppose that a mail carrier is killed by a resident of a home claiming to have acted in self-defense in Denver, Colorado. The DOJ could reach an irrevocable agreement with the resident to accept a plea bargain to a misdemeanor charge of not paying the tax due on the sale of the firearm from a non-compliant gun shop, dismissing forever the charge of murder of a federal post office employee. But that agreement would not bar the District Attorney in Denver from bringing murder charges twenty years later under state law prohibiting murder of human beings in the State of Colorado. For the defendant resident to prevent that from happening definitively, an agreement from the State of Colorado's District Attorney in Denver, or the Colorado Attorney General, would also be required."}

{"question":"tl;dr: Do I have to return a package that was sent to me that I've already been refunded for?Background:In early October, I pre-ordered the Microsoft Band 2; a fitness monitor. It wasn't scheduled to be released in Canada until late November (~20), so I didn't expect it anytime soon. Near the end of October however, I received a tracking number from Microsoft, and had my credit card charged for the full amount of the product. Sure enough, it had been sent a month early, apparently in error. I checked the tracking page, and marked my calendar for the 2nd of November, excited I was getting it early.Well, the 2nd came and went. To my frustration, the package ended up getting stuck in customs for days. Then, I received an email from a \"Chuck Norris\" (I'm not kidding) that Microsoft had realized their error, and couldn't allow me to have the package early. Instead, my order was cancelled, refunded, I was given a $20 credit for their online store, and told to reorder the Band if I still wanted it. I decided to wait. The package was sent back to China, and sat there for about a week. This picture tells the whole story nicely:Yesterday though, I received a shipping notification. As you can see from the history above, it's since cleared customs, and is scheduled to be delivered today at noon (about 6 hours from now), despite me having received a full refund and credit.What are my options when it arrives? Am I allowed to receive it, then notify Microsoft of the error and offer to pay? Ideally, I'd like to brush it under the rug and not pay (I think Microsoft has enough money to forget about a couple hundred bucks), but I realize that that could bite me down the road.At the advice of @ratchetfreak, I read Microsoft's , and couldnt find anything about orders shipped in error. The only somewhat relevant thing I could find was if there's an error on their website relating to my order, they reserve the right to charge me the correct price (12.) (which I'm fine with).I live in Calgary, Canada.Update as of Nov. 14:The shipping history is still exactly as the picture above; \"in transit\" in Winnipeg. It appears to be a glitch in their systems unfortunately, as I suspect it was stopped at customs; again.Update 5 years later: I never got it, as this parcel was stuck at customs for seemingly forever before being sent back.","answer":"Receive it and keep it.

{"question":"One of the peculiarities of Texas is that it's normal for people to drive 5-10 MPH over the speed limit while on the interstate. Provided they're not doing a speed trap, the police generally don't care.Another of Texas's peculiarities is that most drivers don't respect reduced speed limits for construction zones unless there's a speed trap or it's dangerous to go normal speeds.As a result, if you drive the speed limit, you can conceivably end up driving 15 mph slower than everybody else in construction zones. This is unsafe for you and everybody else on the surrounding road.Say that you're going the speed limit, and someone hits you because you're going 15 mph slower than the prevailing traffic conditions. Are you liable? You're following the speed limit, but by doing so you made yourself a danger to those around you.","answer":"If you are following the speed limit and somebody rear-ends you it is because they were speeding and following too closely.

{"question":"So I was listening to mathematician and economist Eric Weinstein, and he told an anecdote about salary in a hyper-inflationary economy. In the story, the employee and employer argue over the 'fair' compensation as it relates to inflation(then further tied to Gauge theory but that is not relevant), where the employee states salary should be derived from the real spending power of the currency.Would the argument of salary derivative wrt purchasing power(or relative value) hold any water if the notion of constant salary is not explicitly stated? Or is it just implicitly assumed? Would this question differ for a contractor?","answer":"In practice this is rarely done in the US. There have been cases of employment contracts with automatic increases tied to the CPI (Consumer Price Index) or some other measure of inflation -- I believe at one time a number of union contracts specified this. Employer and employee could certainly agree on any such formula. But in the absence of any explicit provision for such a link, and an agreed formula for the resulting salary, I think a stated salary would be interpreted as a fixed sum, not subject to change until an explicit change is made. Fixed wages are the almost invariable custom, and in the absence of any explicit provision for an automatic inflationary change, I think a court would assume a fixed amount, if it came to a court case."}

{"question":"Suppose a commercial language learning app displays a single sentence at a time to a user, with the purpose of reviewing the sentence to learn new words.In order to get examples of natural sentences for learning use, would it be considered fair use in terms of copyright to take sentences from news websites?Reviewing the factors from: Factor 1: Purpose and character of useThe app is for language learning so is therefore of an educational use (weighs in favour)The app is commercial (weighs against)Factor 2: The nature of the copyrighted work\"[T]he scope of fair use is generally broader when the source of borrowed expression is a factual or historical work\" (Campbell).

{"question":"Many colleges and universities charge more to students from out of state. Doesn't this violate the US Constitution, particularly the full faith and credit clause? Has this ever gone to the supreme court, or at least tried to?To me it seems if it was anything else, it would be a violation. A grocery market selling soda at 2x the cost to out-of-state citizens would probably get slapped with a lawsuit right away. This might even fall under other anti-discrimination laws too.If that example violates full faith and credit, why not out-of-state tuition?","answer":" involves a US citizen child living with his parents in Mexico traveled to Texas in order to attend free public school. Under Texas Education Code 21.031(d), the district is allowed to deny tuition-free admission if the child lives apart from the parent or legal guardian and is present in the district 'for the primary purpose of attending the public free schools'. The court upheld such a residence requirement because it 'furthers the substantial state interest in assuring that services provided for the State's residents are enjoyed only by residents', and 'does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment nor burden the constitutional right of interstate travel'. Plaintiffs argued various constitional violations, including Equal Protection, Due Process, and Privileges and Immunities, but not Full Faith and Credit. We may assume that if there were any hope of such an argument, it would have been made.In , it was held that a state cannot permanently relegate an applicant to non-resident status for having a legal address for any time within a year of applying for admission. But the court also explicitly states:  Our holding today should in no wise be taken to mean that Connecticut  must classify the students in its university system as residents, for  purposes of tuition and fees, just because they go to school there.  Nor should our decision be construed to deny a State the right to  impose on a student, as one element in demonstrating bona fide  residence, a reasonable durational residency requirement, which can be  met while in student status. We fully recognize that a State has a  legitimate interest in protecting and preserving the quality of its  colleges and universities and the right of its own bona fide residents  to attend such institutions on a preferential tuition basis.The Full Faith and Credit Clause states:  Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts,  Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the  Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts,  Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.This pertains to recognizing the status of evidence and rulings, between states. If New York finds that Smith is liable for a sum of money, that finding is a legal fact in all states, and Connecticut cannot say 'We do not recognize the judgment of New York'. The only connection between Full Faith and Credit and non-resident tuition is that both include the concept 'other states'."}

{"question":"How's Judge David Jones correct? On May 26 2020,  announced bankruptcy and its price dropped even more, from $2.83 to 0.59.No one ever loses equity in a bankruptcy case, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  said during a status conference in the J.C. Penney case last month. Equity gets lost long before the case is filed.Under U.S. bankruptcy law, shareholders are last in line for any kind of payout -- behind the lawyers, lenders, and vendors -- making a recovery for shares unusual. The size and scope of payouts is usually determined by a so-called Chapter 11 plan, which creditors vote on and send to a federal judge for approval. Those plans often leave even high-ranking creditors getting less than theyre owed.","answer":"Because a company with positive equity isn't bankruptUsually.The simple versionEquity in accounting terms is a part of the Statement of Financial Position (previously called the Balance Sheet) and represents the value owned by the shareholders. It was called a Balance Sheet because it balances:<pre>Assets - Liabilities = Equity<\/pre>A bankrupt company is one that is unable to settle its debts meaning that its Liabilities (what it owes) are greater than its Assets (what it owns). Therefore equity is negative - the equity has been lost before the company files for bankruptcy.Since shareholders have limited liability, they do not have to contribute to pay the company's debts so their shareholding is worthless. Their shareholding can't be worth less than worthless so in that sense David Jones is right No one ever loses equity in a bankruptcy case, Equity gets lost long before the case is filed. It is the loss of the equity that caused the bankruptcy.The more complex versionThe Statement of Financial Position is a point in time measure of the liquidated value of the entity - that is, the value of the company if all assets were sold for their book value and all debts were settled for their book value. This isn't something that can actually happen for all sorts of reasons.A company that gets liquidated will often not realise the full value of its booked assets because these are accounting measures of value rather than sale under the hammer values at a liquidation auction.Further, businesses as  have a different value than their book equity. An ongoing business will make profits (or losses) in the future and the expectation of these needs to be added (or subtracted) from the book equity. This is why a company with negative equity may still be worth operating and, conversely, why one with positive equity maybe should be closed.Also, businesses may have significant off-balance-sheet assets such as valuable IP and branding that was developed in house and therefore don't create bookable transactions. For example, there is no item in the Coca-cola  that represents the value of the brand. This is clearly an item of value that a) isn't on the balance sheet and b) only has value while someone is making cola and using that branding. Kodak, Blockbuster, Panamerican and Concorde were all once valuable brands that now only have nostalgia value.One final point is that it is quite possible for a business with positive equity to go bankrupt because bankruptcy can be triggered by insolvency. Insolvency is being unable to pay your debts as and when they fall due. An asset rich but cash poor organisation can be insolvent while still having positive equity. For example, a property developer may have a large portfolio of valuable property and owe a relatively small amount to contractors, however, if they can't come up with the cash to pay these debts they are insolvent and this can trigger bankruptcy.Many businesses and individuals may be insolvent and recover from it - they borrow money from a bank (or by delaying payments to creditors) or inject more funds into the business. It is usually only when a business is of borderline profitability that insolvency will push them into bankruptcy."}

How is it verified that Trump issued the pardon while he was President and he's not just making it up as a defense at a later time?","answer":"There's no settled legal answer to this, but there seems to be a general consensus that this would not be legal under the Impeachment Clause, which says:The President ... shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.There would be two main issues here:1. Can a president pardon himself?It's never been tried, so it's never been challenged, so the courts have never had a chance to say whether it's legal.The main argument in favor of self-pardons is that the constitution grants broad pardon authority for any offense against the United States, making an exception for impeachment, but not for self-pardons. The response to that is that the constitution uses all kinds of broad language that everyone agrees is not as broad as it sounds; Congress is not allowed to abridge the freedom of speech, but perjury laws are nonetheless constitutional.There are .2.

{"question":"Does a country have the legal right to shoot any military or spy planes down as long as it flies in its airspace?

Let's assume the country is the United States.","answer":"What you're looking for is a convention, in international law, that governs international aviation, the . Article 3 says(a) This Convention shall be applicable only to civil aircraft, andshall not be applicable to state aircraft.(b) Aircraft used in military, customs and police services shall bedeemed to be state aircraft.(c) No state aircraft of a contracting State shall fly over theterritory of another State or land thereon without authorization by aspecial agreement or otherwise, and in accordance with the termsthereof.Article 1 also says thatThe contracting   States  recognize that   every State  has completeand exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territoryThere is no separate international law governing the treatment of state aircraft entering the airspace of a nation without permission: the convention is entirely about protecting civil aircraft. From the recognition of sovereignty of the nation over its airspace and the absence of provisions protecting state aircraft, you may conclude that a nation has the right to shoot down state aircraft over-flying without permission. There are rules to the effect that a civil aircraft may be required to land, as opposed to shooting it down.An aircraft operated by a private company (e.g. Delta airlines) might sue the government of a nation that shot its plane out of the sky, in contravention of the convention. However, the convention does not create a right to sue a government, so if a civil aircraft were shot down for incursion into a nation's airspace, there may or may not be a right to sue depending on the law of the relevant nations.  In the case of the shootdown of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752,  against Iran, in Ontario Superior Court.

In the United States, companies are registered with a state's Division of Corporations (or equivalent), but are also liable for federal income tax.

Therefore, tax on corporate income is only paid once.Sole proprietorships would commonly be regarded by the federal government as an S corporation.Just as a concluding thought exercise: a firm can be organized as an LLC under state law, certified as a B Corporation, and recognized by the federal government as a C corporation. It can actually be all of these three things at once."}
{"question":"I was recently pulled over on a charge of speeding. When filling out the ticket, the officer did not include my car's model or style, despite the model being clearly visible on the rear of the car. Is this omission important enough to warrant a dismissal of the case?","answer":"<h3>You will still have to pay<\/h3>A ticket can be ammended if the state so chooses (they can look up what color and model your car is).  The car is probably on video.  The officer can testify if they wrote your car info down somewhere else.  And if they identified you inside the car as the violator, the car's color hardly matters.The idea that minor mistakes or omissions on tickets can get you off is a myth."}
{"question":"Im curious as to what would the legalities be if I were to post a review of a local restaurant (negative) and include a photo I took at the time of the poor service that included the extremely rude employee working behind the counter... is that legal? The establishment does not care about my concerns so I wanted to post a detailed review but dont want to be sued.","answer":"First of all, as several comments have said, anyone can sue for just about anything. Some suits are obviously without merit and will be promptly dismissed, and the people filing such suits may be penalized by the court, but the suits were still filed.DefamationIf the online review contains statements of fact, or purported fact, which are defamatory, or which might be claimed to be defamatory, a suit for defamation might well be filed. To win such a suit, the plaintiff (presumably the employee or perhaps the store owner) would need to prove that the statements were false (or at least that some of them were) and that they did actual harm to the plaintiff's reputation. If the plaintiff is a public figure there would also need to be proof of actual malice, that is knowing falsehood or reckless disregard of possible falsehood. However an individual retail employee is probably not a public figure.If an online review contains only statements of opinion, any defamation suit would be obviously without merit, and would probably be dismissed early. Few reputable lawyers would file such a suit.Filing a defamation suit involves significant upfront expense, time, and trouble. Most retail employees will not be able to afford the costs of such a suit, even when there is a good chance of winning. A law firm might provide the expenses on a contingent fee basis, but only if they review the case and think there is a substantial chance of winning, because they lose money in such a case if they do not prevail or at least get a significant settlement.CopyrightI see this was tagged copyright. No one has a copyright on their personal appearance, or on actual real events. An account of things that really happened, if it is not copied from someone else's account, is not an infringement of anyone's copyright. There simply is not copyright issue in the situation as described in the question, and I will be changing the tags.Invasion of PrivacyIn some US states there are torts of  of several kinds for which a person could sue. None of these seem to apply to the situation as described in the question.<h3>Right of Publicity<\/h3>In some US states a person has a right of publicity, so that the person's image or likeness may not be used to advertise or promote things without permission. (This is also known as the Tort of Appropriation.) But here the poster of the review would not be using the employee's picture to promote anything, rather the opposite. There seems to be no valid basis for a suit on such grounds in the situation described in the question.<h3>Private Facts<\/h3>In some US states a person may sue when private facts are disclosed in a way that is highly embarrassing. But to win such a suit, significant efforts to keep the facts private must have been taken, and the disclosure must be clearly offensive to a reasonable person.<h3>Intrusion Upon Seclusion<\/h3>This applies where a person's home or other private space is violated, either directly or though technology. This can include a classic eavesdropper or Peeping Tom, or a bug. It can also include concealed still or video cameras. But in all such cases, the person intruded upon must have a reasonable expectation of privacy. No one working behind the counter of a retail store, serving the public, or as a waiter in a restaurant, has such an expectation while at work.<h3>False Light<\/h3>Some US states recognize a tort of false light. This is similar to a defamation case, however, it is used when no actual false statements are made, but the statements are misleading while technically true. This generally requires proof of actual malice, even if the plaintiff is not a public figure. According to the *Restatement of Torts 92nd) section 652E:One who gives publicity to a matter concerning another before the public in a false light is subject to liability to the other for invasion of privacy, if (a) the false light in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) the actor had knowledge of or acted in a reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.Such  suit does not seem likely to prevail in the situation described, and many of the issues discussed above under Defamation would also apply. The requirement to prove actual malice further hinders any such suit.ConclusionThere seems no basis for the waiter, or the store owner, to prevail in any suit based upon posting the waiter's photo along with a negative review online. Filing such a suit is always possible, but seems unlikely, precisely because it has little chancy of success."}
{"question":"Say that Bob wrote a paper that consists of the word, \"industrialised\". This is how the British English word is spelled. Now, say that Jerry wants to quote Bob on his paper. But Jerry speaks American English, and so he spells the word, \"industrialized\". Jerry changes the word to the American version. Can Bob take legal action (assuming he has full copyright protection), against Jerry for changing the dialect of the same language?","answer":"I know of no cause of action related to misrepresentation of intellectual property (I believe it may be a phrase used colloquially in the context of academic integrity). If such a cause of action exists, I'll leave it to another answer to discuss. This answer approaches your question through the lens of copyright infringement and moral rights.A reproduction is an infringement if it substantially reproduces the original. Short quotes, properly attributed, will often be fair use, even if exactly reproduced.If an exact reproduction is not an infringement (e.g. because it copied too short a phrase) or if it is  would also not be an infringement or would be fair use.In jurisdictions that recognize , there may be circumstances where an alteration, even to spelling, would be a violation of an author's moral rights. But to make out a violation of an author's moral rights based only on a spelling alteration, the spelling would have to be critical to the integrity of the work (e.g. perhaps the choice of dialect) and the alteration would have to be prejudicial to the author's honour or reputation."}

{"question":"I ate in a restaurant one day and paid with my Discover credit card. The restaurant reluctantly accepted it but told me that this card incurs a higher fee to them. The next day after my meal, they refused to accept this same credit card. I happened to carry enough cash with me and paid with cash instead.My question: Do I have the legal right to insist on making the payment with my Discover credit card? If not, what if I only carry one Discover credit card with me? That is, what if this is the only payment method that I can offer?Just a side note:  says that \"Discover is accepted nationwide by 99% of the places that take credit cards.\" But practically many places have the ability to charge a Discover card but prefer not accept it. Not a legal issue but a frustrating observation.Edit I called Discover customer service and here is their response:Just go to places where Discover Credit Cards are accepted.Doesn't sound very helpful.","answer":"You have the legal (contractual) obligation to pay the amount that you owe for your meal. The restaurant can refuse to accept a particular kind of payment, such as check, cash, credit cards (generally or brand-specific), various cash-transfer programs, foreign currency, bitcoin or ridiculous numbers of pennies. There is no requirement that they do today what they did yesterday.If you have in your possession only a Discover card, and if they are unwilling to accept service barter as payment (washing dishes is classical), then you would have a debt to the restaurant which you must pay in a reasonable time, using an acceptable medium (such as cash, unless they don't accept cash). They cannot make it impossible or highly burdensome for you to discharge your obligation (e.g. they cannot demand Krugerrands or  as the alternative payment, unless you are in Mongolia).You were given advance notice of this possibility of non-acceptance, yet you willfully proffered a card that you knew that they were not likely to accept a second time. Your hands were not clean, and if this had gone to court, you could not expect mercy from the court on the grounds that you were surprised that they didn't accept your card."}
{"question":"I know the question sounds mundane and perhaps even silly at first glance, but, consider it for a moment.Our qualm with piracy seems to be premised with some notion of loss at the owners\/business' expense. Every study I've read calculating loss by software piracy presupposes that, without piracy, every transgressor would have bought the software (particularly the BSA). Additionally, we cannot deny businesses have all the litigious incentive in the world to pursue the highest estimates of damages Now, by definition piracy is generallyThe illegal duplication and distribution of copyrighted files (US Legal, Inc)...By definition of loss\/theft, how is one deprived of their software if the 'crime' is only the duplication of said software?How is there loss when the owner(s) not only still own the original piece of the software, but only dealt with general expenses of management, coding, advertisement, et cetera, and not any expenses of the duplication? There is some exception when it comes to physical copies such as video games at stores, for example, in my opinion, because there are direct expenses keeping those games on shelves, producing cases and discs, et cetera. If we consider even a copy of software [without consent] a form of theft and therefore loss, then would it not be theft for me to legally license software and then duplicate another file of it? After all, even though I licensed the software I still made a duplicate without consent, yes?","answer":"It isnt theftTheft requires depriving the legal owner of possession permanently.In concept its closer to fraud than theft, however, copyright violation is its own crime - neither theft nor fraud.In casual usage, you can call it theft if you like - or pomegranate, or Howard.

{"question":"Religion and politics, as we know, shouldn't intermix. The purpose for having a legal marriage through the government is simple: When people decide to be romantically involved in a permanent way, they require certain legal protections in case that arrangement goes bad, in which case specific guidelines are followed to handle various situations between two people in this situation together. Nowhere in that legal process does the sex of either of these two people matter in any way shape or form legally speaking. Am I wrong? So someone, please explain to me, a straight guy (therefore non biased) by the way, why the legal system of the US goverment (previously) decided States could base the qualification for legal marriage, on the sex of the people wishing to be married, a position that is in every way shape and form culturally and religiously founded, with no business being included in the law?I find the distinction no different from our legal system, not too long ago, similarly deciding the people of different skin color couldn't be free. Its intollerance towards 'different', and as an American citizen, I find it appalling that my government recently applied this bevahior in its legal system. So can anyone explain the legal justification for taking sex of the participants into account in the process of legal, government facilitated marriage? Note: I'm interested in legal reasoning that gay marriage wasnt supported by the Supreme Court until only last year. It seems like the only reason the change came was due to media pressure and coverage, and our legal system should protect minorities before such coverage is had, for example for the past decade and longer. ","answer":"The first thing to note is that your question is kind of the wrong way around.  US states are sovereign and generally have the ability to make any kind of laws they want, unless they violate some specific tenet of federal law or the US Constitution.  You suggest, for instance, that arguments which are 'culturally founded' have no place in the law, but that's just your opinion, and there isn't generally anything preventing a state from making law based on such things, should its elected legislature see fit to do so.  (Indeed, one could argue that nearly all laws are in some sense 'culturally founded', since they are based on some notion of what kind of behavior is or is not appropriate, and those tend to be culturally based.)So legally speaking, the states aren't, by default, obligated to give any sort of justification for the laws they made.  The burden of proof is on the other side.  Someone seeking to overturn those laws would have to convince a court that the laws violated some specific provision of the Constitution (or another superior law).  If they couldn't convince a court of this, the law would stand.From what I have read, before the US Supreme Court's 2015 legalization of same-sex marriage in  itself is quite short and is worthwhile to read.  Quoting Wikipedia's summary, the plaintiffs claimed that Minnesota's restriction of marriage to opposite-sex couples violated several provisions of the US Constitution:    First Amendment (freedom of speech and of association),  Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment),  Ninth Amendment (unenumerated right to privacy), and  Fourteenth Amendment (fundamental right to marry under the Due Process Clause and sex discrimination contrary to the Equal Protection  Clause).  The Minnesota court determined that none of the plaintiffs' objections were valid.    Again, I'll refer you to the decision for the details, but the court mainly focused on their Fourteenth Amendment arguments (the others may have been addressed by the trial court, whose opinion I can't find online).  They wrote:  The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, like the due process clause, is not offended by the state's classification of persons authorized to marry. There is no irrational or invidious discrimination. They specifically rejected any analogy to bans on interracial marriage, which had been held unconstitutional in :  But in commonsense and in a constitutional sense, there is a clear distinction between a marital restriction based merely upon race and one based upon the fundamental difference in sex.Baker appealed to the US Supreme Court, but his appeal was  is an essay discussing the situation in a little more depth.)  The effect of the dismissal was that the Minnesota court's decision became binding precedent upon the whole nation - laws against same-sex marriage didn't violate those provisions of the Constitution.  And that was how matters stood for 44 years until Obergefell.  (Of course, there was nothing to stop individual states from deciding to allow same-sex marriage, and some in fact did so in the meantime.)You have suggested that laws against same-sex marriage were religiously motivated.  This might suggest an argument that they would violate the  of the First Amendment.  The plaintiffs in Baker didn't raise that point, so it wasn't considered in the Minnesota court's opinion.  I don't know whether any other courts have considered it; no such argument was mentioned in the opinion in Obergefell."}
{"question":"I've seen similar questions regarding leaked data\/malware, and from what I've seen, it appears that code, regardless of legality, is under copyright, and therefore shouldn't be possessed. But can the copyright holders sue without identifying themselves? Is it a risk with any significance? Also I saw that merely downloading also may be \"hacking\" under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (though presumably distributing is a larger offense\/more likely to be pursued). So is downloading\/possessing leaked source code illegal?Secondary question: Why does this differ from the legality of reversing source code (which is perfectly allowed unless the code is patented)?","answer":"Source code is protected by copyright, even if it is designed for an unethical or illegal purpose. Making a copy without permission is copyright infringement, as is distributing a copy without permission, unless an exception to copyright applies. In the US the primary exception is fair use. Whether a use constitutes a fair use or not depends on the detailed facts, including the nature and purpose of the use, and the plausible effect on the market for the protected work. The question does not contain enough information for even a rough fair use analysis.It is generally not unlawful to create malware, only to use it to access a computer or network without permission, or to do other unlawful acts. Thus the copyright holder could sue without implicating him- or herself in a crime. However, damages would probably depend largely on the commercial value of the program, and if the only plausible use was criminal, the legitimate value might be quite low.Possessing an unauthorized copy of a work is not a crime, nor is it infringement. The maker and distributor of an unauthorized copy commits infringement, but the recipient does not. Whether unauthorized access and downloading is a crime under the CFAA depends on the factual details. Many things that might technically be crimes under the CFAA are not prosecuted. That is a matter for the relevant prosecutor to determine."}
{"question":"In the case of selling goods on classified ads (particularly in the US on websites like Craigslist), can someone bring a lawsuit for lost time and cost of transportation if the described items are found to the potential buyer to be falsely represented in the ad? This is assuming nothing was actually purchased. ","answer":"False (deceptive) advertising is illegal in the US  in craigslist-type cases, usually pursued via state law such as  94 Wn.2d 40,  the conduct complained of must: (1) be unfair or deceptive; (2) be  within the sphere of trade or commerce; and (3) impact the public  interest.Under . Two+ ways in which that could be done are:  (1) Violates a statute that incorporates this chapter;    (2) Violates a statute that contains a specific legislative  declaration of public interest impact; or    (3)(a) Injured other persons;which would not be the case (though the latter might hold if you knew someone else who suffered such a loss); so the possibility of a suit relies on  (b) had the capacity to injure other persons; or (c) has the capacity  to injure other persons.If you were injured, and the cause of the injury is out there in public, then the advertisement has the capacity to injure others. Another issue is whether the act is in the 'sphere of trade or commerce', which probably is not the case when a person decides to unload their lawnmower on Craigslist, but would be the case for a person who sells things through such a list (as a business).In Anhold, the court held that   the presence of public interest is demonstrated when the proof  establishes that (1) the defendant by unfair or deceptive acts or  practices in the conduct of trade or commerce has induced the  plaintiff to act or refrain from acting; (2) the plaintiff suffers  damage brought about by such action or failure to act; and (3) the  defendant's deceptive acts or practices have the potential for  repetition. authorizes private action in such a case, which allows a plaintiff to recover actual damages (including attorney's fees). The court also has the discretion to award treble damages (same statute). Actual damages could include e.g. the cost of flying to the sale site, the cost of an inspector, and so on. This all assumes that the advertisement is truly deceptive, and not just hyperbolic (e.g. claiming 'like new' when the item is 'somewhat used')  for example advertising a rusted T-bird hood as a full, functioning car.

Without addressing the validity of those claims, I'm wondering what recourse there would be if the such an action occurred?Lets say that a president clearly and blatantly abused his position for financial gain, in violation of the constitution.  Other then impeachment, which has never-before lead to a successful conviction, is there any other check in place to prevent or penalize a president for violating this?Is there some way that the supreme court could rule the president's actions in financial system unconstitutional, and even if they did what would that mean?","answer":"The constitution does not actually forbid 'abusing a position for financial gain', and thus it is left to the political process to address any such actions (voting for a different candidate), or the legislative process (defining certain acts as forbidden)  or, the impeachment process. The court system in the US does not have the power to decide on their own what politicians can and can't do, if there is no underlying law. It is within congressional power to define limits on the act of any politician, for example Congress could pass a law requiring the President and Vice-President to have no business interests or stocks during their term of office; they could require that of cabinet members or members of Congress. Such a law would, of course, either require presidential approval or else sufficient support in the houses of congress to override a veto.There are various limits on what government folks can do.  is an example of a limit on the limits:  Except as otherwise provided in such sections, the terms officer and  employee in sections 203, 205, 207 through 209, and 218 of this  title shall not include the President, the Vice President, a Member of  Congress, or a Federal judgeIt is possible that a president could engage in a criminal act such as theft, and that is not permitted and would be grounds for impeachment. The president does not, however, have the power to e.g. unilaterally send all government hotel business to a certain hotel company, nor can he declare that 10% of all government expenditures must be deposited in his personal bank account, so the mechanisms whereby corrupt rules of certain other nations can get away with that is that those executives have vastly more power in their countries than POTUS does.

Any law purporting to limit that ability would have to beat a First Amendment challenge, which is typically a tough thing to do.With regard to the specific causes of action you mentioned, none of them would apply:Privacy: this would not be an intrusion upon seclusion or a public disclosure of private facts, both of which require that the acquisition or dissemination of the plaintiff's information be 'highly offensive to the reasonable person.' An e-mail address is basic directory information that people freely disclose on a regular basis and often make affirmative efforts to publicize. It would not satisfy that test.Harassment: Harassment requires some contact between the defendant and the victim. Giving the service your e-mail address doesn't involve contacting you.Spam: Spam also requires that someone send you e-mail. Giving the service your e-mail address doesn't involve sending you an e-mail.That's obviously all assuming normal use as intended by the service. Other cases could present different scenarios, especially if a user takes your e-mail and uses it to harass you or do something else, those actions would be illegal, but holding the service liable for the user's offenses based on its receipt or disclosure of information would almost certainly fail on First Amendment grounds.Because the service is legal, there's really no legal reason to prohibit it from advertising on social media. A law prohibiting those advertisements would probably also fail under the First Amendment. Different platforms would of course be free to independently choose not to allow those ads."}
{"question":"In DotA 1, the heroes are organized into three attributes: Strength, Agility and Intelligence and 2 factions: Sentinel and Scourge. Will reusing all of these names mentioned will cause a new game to became a derivative work, even through these names are apparently generic?

If it ever was, it has been completely undefended for the last 40 years, so it's much too late to now attempt to claim rights.Sentinel and ScourgeLet me dodge that one and generalize: Can you use   Alliance-Horde?<br \/>Terran-Protoss-Zerg?<br \/>Empire-Rebellion?<br \/>Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Slytherin?See, there's a real spectrum there!  The four names alone are so unique that J.K. Rowling would come after you if you used them anywhere.  But Empire-Rebellion is too generic to assert an IP claim over.And if you pluck non-paired names from an IP, like Ravenclaw-Granger, that's not a problem either.  A Wild West movie with feuding families the Grangers and Ravenclaws, would be absolutely fine; whereas Ravenclaws and Gryffindors would not be fine!DOTA 1, however, is a copyright morass. Many games permit fan-created mods, ranging from the TM:PE traffic modeling mod in Cities: Skylines to the TSM auction pricing mod in World of Warcraft.  The mod is nothing without the game. The game author doesn't own the mod, The mod author doesn't own the game.  They coexist mostly by consent.DOTA I was an arena mod to Warcraft III and there has been quite considerable fighting over ownership of that IP. Valve now owns it .Even so, the Sentinel-Scourge pairing is only really important in DOTA I.  The pairing doesn't mean much in Warcraft III, as they are disjoint, like my Granger-Ravenclaw example above.You would probably be fine, but the risk of trouble is exactly why original games create original IP - for instance Sentinels-Scourge was not reused in DOTA II!"}
{"question":"According to well-established precedent, Texas' heartbeat bill is not valid law. Is it therefore defamation to claim that those who violate it are \"breaking the law\"? Also, even if the bill were a valid law, AFAIK it's not a criminal statute. Is it defamation to claim that those who violate it are \"committing a crime\"?","answer":"Is it therefore defamation to claim that those who violate it are breaking the law? AFAIK it's not a criminal statute. Is it defamation to claim that those who violate it are committing a crime?No. These assertions rather constitute statements of opinion and therefore are not actionable. For it to constitute a possibly actionable statement of fact, it would have to falsely impute to someone a specific, ascertainable act or conduct.Furthermore, in some contexts the matter at issue is so sensitive that its implications on someone's reputation is independent of whether a bill reaches enactment. Abortion is one such topic. A person's view of an abortionist is very unlikely to be influenced by the ensuing legislation. To people who oppose abortion, abortionists are equally repugnant regardless of whether the act of aborting additionally constitutes a violation of some statute. Conversely, abortion supporters are not going to have a worse impression of an abortionist merely on grounds that abortion becomes outlawed."}

I rarely even know when my wife gets the oil changed. We do occasionally drive the other's vehicles.Under the laws of marital property, are the vehicles purchased prior to the marriage considered marital property? This is specific to the State of Wisconsin but any US-based opinions are appreciated.Update - It appears WI is a community property state. It's my understanding that property acquired before the marriage is separate from property acquired after the marriage when everything (minus exceptions like inheritance) is community property and owned equally by both parties.

{"question":"Someone mentioned to me that they ran into someone with '?' (the AE grapheme) in their name, which got me wondering what characters are allowable in the US.I've done a bit of research and found that it seems like name changing, baby registration, (and maybe immigration?) are state specific forms, though do have to be followed by a federal request to get your social security card.All of the state specific forms and the social security forms I've been able to find don't have any information on what is allowable characters.  They are all forms to be printed out and hand filled in so presumably any character you can write legibly can be submitted, though, presumably, may not be accepted.The only information I was able to find was california only allows the 26 letters and don't even allow accents or anything else.  But that doesn't really answer the questions for other states or for social security.  I would assume that the printers\/software\/process used to print out social security cards would only allow a specific set of characters that is probably far shot of all of Unicode, but I can't validate that.  I understand the answer might be different by state, so don't expect an answer that covers all 50 states, though it seems like the social security answer would override other answers.NOTE: I'm just curious about this and don't actually want to change my own name or name a kid with numbers\/symbols\/emojis\/etc.","answer":"There is ultimately no meaningful regulation of name choice in the United States, but failing to follow convention can be a pain.Many countries have far more rigorous regulation of names and often require that a name be on a pre-approved list or at least that it receive advanced governmental approval.For example, I changed my surname when I married from Willeke to Oh-Willeke but many private and governmental computer systems do not accept hyphens in names. Non-standard characters and different kinds of punctuation pose similar issues. For example, most databases cannot handle Greek\/Cyrillic alphabet characters such as \u03c0 so they would have to spelled out Pi for inclusion in many databases.For example, I am not certain that the databases of most government agencies, even in Colorado which has a large Hispanic population, are capable of distinguishing between ? and n. Similarly, I am sure that ? (the AE grapheme) would be recorded as ae in most computerized databases and on most identification documents. Likewise, few identification document systems or computer databases can process Korean , so my children's middle names are in a particular romanization of the true and correct Hangul spelling of those names.Various agencies such as vital statistics departments and driver's license bureaus have practical limitations on their ability to input information into computer systems, but that doesn't really limit a true name, which at common law could be changed without resort to the court system or any bureaucracy, something which remains the law in Colorado.The bottom line is that even if your name in its true form has a representation in symbols that a database can't process and that really and truly is recognized in the law as your legal name, as a matter of practical reality, many entities that deal with names will be limited to a romanization of those names.Consider the following excerpt from a court of appeals case in Colorado that explains the underlying law:Walter Knight, an inmate of the State Prison, petitioned the districtcourt to change his name to Sundiata Simba. His reasons were 'toacknowledge the heritage of (his) past, and to Fortify (his)acceptance of (his) religious beliefs as required by (his) faith.'Nine months later, the request was denied. We reverse.The statute under which the petition was filed, \u00a7 13--15--101,C.R.S.1973, provides that the court must approve the change of name ifit is 'satisfied that the desired change would be proper, and notdetrimental to the interests of any other person.' Here, the courtheld that the change would not be 'proper' because Knight has alengthy criminal record, is incarcerated, and an F.B.I. 'rap' sheet isextant which lists him under his present name. However, there was noevidence Before the court as to how the name change would beprejudicial to prison or police authorities. Therefore, we do notconsider any of these reasons, without additional proof, as sufficientbasis for the court to conclude that the change of name would beimproper. In this day when a Lew Alcindor elects to be known as KareemAbdul-Jabbar, and Cassius Clay opts for Muhammad Ali, the desire ofWalter Knight to reflect his African heritage by adopting the [36Colo.App. 189] name Sundiata Simba should not be dismissed lightly.Cf. Petition of Rusconi, 341 Mass. 167, 167 N.E.2d 847.At common law, a person could adopt another name at will. Statutessetting forth procedures to be followed in changing a name merelyprovide an additional method for making the change. See 57 Am.Jur.2dName \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11. It is more advantageous to the state to have thestatutory method of changing names followed, Application of McGehee,147 Cal.App.2d 25, 304 P.2d 167, and for that reason applicationsunder the statute should be encouraged, Petition of Buyarsky, 322Mass. 335, 77 N.E.2d 216, and generally should be granted unless madefor a wrongful or fraudulent purpose. Application of Ferris, 178 Misc.534, 34 N.Y.S.2d 909. See generally Annot., 110 A.L.R. 219.While a court has wide discretion in matters of this type, it shouldnot deny the application for a change of name as being improper unlessspecial circumstances or facts are found to exist. Included in thesewould be 'unworthy motive, the possibility of fraud on the public, orthe choice of a name that is bizarre, unduly lengthy, ridiculous oroffensive to common decency and good taste.' In re M., 91 N.J.Super.296, 219 A.2d 906; See Petition of Rusconi, supra. Likewise, there isauthority to deny the change if the interests of a wife or child ofthe applicant would be adversely affected thereby. See Annot., 53A.L.R.2d 914.We do not suggest that a court must grant every petition for change ofname; rather, we hold that some substantial reason must exist fordenying such petition, and that none appears in the record Before us.See In Re Ross, 8 Cal.2d 608, 67 P.2d 94. Before a court denies arequest for a change of name under the statute, it should conduct anevidentiary hearing to determine if good and sufficient cause existsto deny the application. Cf. Henderson v. Industrial Commission,Colo.App., 529 P.2d 651.In re Knight, 36 Colo.App. 187, 188-189, 537 P.2d 1085, 1086 (1975).

But, neitherstatute actually purports to limit the means by which someone maychange their name in Colorado.

{"question":"This question is not specific to Florida which is only provided as an example.Florida Statute  requires an \"oath or affirmation\":For state elective offices:... that he or she will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Florida.For federal elective offices:... that he or she will support the Constitution of the United States.Thus, it would appear that if such an individual had voted for a law that was subsequently found to be unconstitutional, that individual would have violated their obligation to \"support the Constitution\". In Florida, that may be considered a third-degree felony, depending on the the meaning of the phrase.Florida Statute  regarding \"false swearing\":(1) A person who willfully swears or affirms falsely to any oath or affirmation, or [...], in connection with or arising out of voting or elections commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.Admittedly, the use of \"willfully\" and \"falsely\" may limit the use of the statute to, for example, \"single-issue\" candidates who don't care what it means to \"support the Constitution\" and only want to enact a law without regard to the applicable Constitution.Is there a legal definition or meaning for \"support the Constitution\"?","answer":"An oath of office cannot be legally enforced through the courts, other than to demand that officials take it in order to take office, and to bar people who have taken it and then engaged in treason or sedition from holding public office in any federal, state, or local office, military or civilian, in the United States.This is something which is required of all federal and state and local public officials under the U.S. Constitution, which states in the third paragraph of Article VI:The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members ofthe several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicialOfficers, both of the United States and of the several States, shallbe bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but noreligious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Officeor public Trust under the United States.The U.S. President's parallel oath of office is found in the last paragraph of Section 1 of Article II of the U.S. Constitution. It states:Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take thefollowing Oath or Affirmation:  I do solemnly swear (or affirm) thatI will faithfully execute the Office of President of the UnitedStates, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect anddefend the Constitution of the United States.But, while taking the oath is required, :An oath is not justiciable. The FBI cannot investigate adherence tooaths because they are not enforceable as codified law. A prosecutorcannot establish that an oath has been broken by proving certain legalelements beyond a reasonable doubt, and a judge cannot adjudicate it.There is one exception to this rule, however. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states:No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or electorof President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil ormilitary, under the United States, or under any State, who, havingpreviously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer ofthe United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as anexecutive or judicial officer of any State, to support theConstitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrectionor rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemiesthereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House,remove such disability.So, an oath of office does impose a justiciable duty to not engage in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or give aid or comfort to the enemies of the United States, upon pain of not being able to hold any state or federal, military or civilian public office without a two-third majority waiver from Congress (in addition to any other consequences that may flow from this conduct without regard to having taken an oath). But, this is a very slight slap on the wrist indeed for committing treason or engaging in sedition (which are criminally punishable by decades in prison or death) after having sworn this oath.Justice Joseph Story  in his A Familiar Exposition of the Constitution of the United States (1842) that:A President, who shall dare to violate the obligations of his solemnoath or affirmation of office, may escape human censure, nay, may evenreceive applause from the giddy multitude. But he will be compelled tolearn, that there is a watchful Providence, that cannot be deceived;and a righteous Being, the searcher of all hearts, who will renderunto all men according to their deserts. Considerations of this sortwill necessarily make a conscientious man more scrupulous in thedischarge of his duty; and will even make a man of looser principlespause, when he is about to enter upon a deliberate violation of hisofficial oath.The purpose of an oath of office is simply to deny public offices to people who are not willing to publicly state that the legal system in which the people taking them will operate is legitimate.An oath to support the constitution is the modern equivalent of the feudal European ritual of bending the knee to one's legitimate feudal superior. This ritual was highlighted, for example, in the .Another legacy of this historical tradition is the duty of someone in military service to salute his or her superior officer.As a historical note, these seemingly toothless rituals have, historically, been surprisingly effective a screening out hard core extremist leaders trying to bring down a government based upon claims that the whole system is illegitimate when new regimes are established, and following civil wars and insurgencies.Many regimes, democratic and non-democratic, in Western political history, have imposed similar requirements. When they have done so, this has seriously influenced the political tactics used by factions that deny the legitimacy of the state and its incumbent leaders. Simply taking the oath undermines one's credibility as an insurgent leader, even if one does so in bad faith.In the United States, oaths of office were also key preconditions to the post-conflict settlements if the .As a more recent example, the requirement of an oath of office has materially influenced the 20th and 21st century political tactics of , a political movement in Ireland, seeking to make the U.K. political subdivision known as Northern Ireland, which it deems illegitimate, a part of the Republic of Ireland.Notably, the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486 (1969), distinguished between a Congressional determination that someone has not satisfied the constitutionally established requirements to have an oath of office administered to them after they have been elected, which can be made by majority vote, and a Congressional determination that a member of Congress should be expelled by a two-thirds majority vote of the house of Congress to which the member of Congress has been elected. A Congressional vote to expel a member of Congress is a non-justiciable question that is not tied to the content of the member's oath of office.Similarly, judicial and executive branch officials in the federal government may be impeached by Congress, and removed from office through that process, only for high crimes and misdemeanors and not merely for otherwise failing to live up to their oath of office in a non-criminal manner (although what constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors is also a non-justiciable political question).Some legal authorities, however, have held that in some contexts, the oath of office does reflect an intent to , when its constitutionality has not yet been definitively adjudicated yet.But, courts have also held, for example, that a member of the U.S. military does not have standing to bring a suit claiming that military action in which he is involved was unconstitutionally authorized. This decision was reached on the grounds that the claim that the service member was forced to violate that service member's oath of office does not constitute a justiciable injury in fact to that member for standing to sue purposes.

{"question":"Say a truck driver were to plow into a speed limit sign, rendering it completely unreadable, and further completely unidentifiable as a speed limit sign.

Those speed limits apply except when there is a sign posted, in which case the sign preempts the prima facie speed limit. Michigan's DOT site has a good explanation:Statutory speed limits are set either as maximum\/minimum speed limits or as prima facie restrictions. Prima facie is Latin for on the face of it and is the speed limit under most circumstances. These speed limits are set legislatively and apply throughout the state.Additionally, there are restrictions based on the current road conditions. California calls this a Basic Speed Law.California has a Basic Speed Law. This law means that you may never drive faster than is safe for current conditions.

{"question":"This question in particular concerns using SoundHound\/Shazam\/MusixMatch or other commercial song identification apps in the United States to attempt to identify Japanese songs, but this question is conceivably relevant for the identification of non-Japanese songs as well.A little context: the Japanese music industry is quite strict about keeping much of its music inside of its borders (at least digitally). For example, there are a lot of songs that have been released on the Japanese Amazon MP3 or iTunes stores, but they are nowhere to be found in the respective United States stores.The Japanese music industry goes to great lengths to ensure that their music does not end up digitally outside of their country. For example, I have seen many Japanese songs get taken down Youtube very quickly after their uploads due to copyright violations. Why can't commercial song identification apps identify certain songs, especially ones whose access is restricted to Japan? Shazam, etc. use audio fingerprinting to identify songs, so they must keep samples of the songs somewhere.So my conjecture is that they can't identify Japanese songs because they can't legally keep samples due to Japan's policies concerning the digital distribution of their music.Is this true? Or is there some other reason for why commercial song identification apps won't identify foreign songs?","answer":"They wouldn't need to keep samples, just the fingerprint. So they could send a guy with a laptop to Japan, download all the songs, fingerprint them, and take the fingerprints back home. It's not a problem, but it would be expensive. I suspect that US and European record companies will make the music available to them for free, otherwise they'd have to pay 20-30 million dollars for 20-30 million songs. The Japanese record companies wouldn't, so while it is technically and legally possible to collect the fingerprints, it would be expensive. And what is the benefit? We are talking here about music that you cannot legally own, that you cannot legally buy after the software recognised it, so there is very little incentive to spend that money. "}

The following events occurred within one day.8:30AM: I am given a new project, that I start working on on the companys laptop from my home10:30AM: I receive an email on my personal email account informing me of my termination, without any details or explanation, and asking me to return equipment and pick up personal belongings on-site. Immediately, my professional email account is deleted by my supervisors without warning (containing both professional and personal data, such as health coverage, etc) .01:30PM: While I am on my way to return company equipment and pick up my belongings, my supervisor sends me a text message warning me that I am not allowed on the premises and that the exchange of equipment will happen in the hall of the building. My belongings were packed for me and brought to me. My supervisor refused any comments or explanations I cant tell you anything.

This wasnt the case.I find suspicious that I wasnt allowed to delete my own personal information from the companys desktop computer.

There could be contractual terms that have to be followed, and the reason for the firing might be illegal (such as your race).

Many Supreme Court cases depend on this; any time the Court strikes down a law, this is what they're doing.Some civil rights are protected by the Constitution itself, or by its Amendments; the 14th amendment, for example, would prohibit a state from passing such a law as above.  Congress has the power to enforce this prohibition, per the 5th section of the amendment:  Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.But that's actually granting Congress that power (since the 10th amendment otherwise limits the power of Congress).  Even if Congress does not exercise that power, nonetheless any state that passes a law contrary to this Amendment (or any other) would find that law subject to be struck down by the Courts under judicial review.Of course, the actions of the Court are the actions of nine men and women, and it is certainly not guaranteed that they will act in a correct manner at any time; referring to the comment about the internment of Japanese citizens.  In the specific case noted - denying Muslims the right to hold office - this would be held up based on First Amendment rights as well as Fourteenth;  supports that (which struck down a prohibition against atheists holding office, but the reasoning would be the same).As far as mentally impaired individuals, many states do prohibit them from holding office.  I wouldn't be surprised to find, in the (probably not near) future, that this is eventually struck down as well."}
{"question":"The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, usually known as the Berne Convention, is an international agreement governing copyright, which was first accepted in Berne, Switzerland, in 1886.Although widely recognized around the world, there are still some countries that are not signatories to the Berne Convention. For example: Palestine, Somalia, Iran, Iraq, etc.What would happen if an Iranian artist or designer's work is plagiarized by an American company, would they still be protected by the Berne Convention?What if the aforementioned creative individual later moves to a country that is a member of the Berne Convention? Would there be retrospective application?","answer":"NoThe  requires member states to afford copyright protection equal to their own to works from other member states.

{"question":"Say a company is facing a trial and the court requires(version 1) the company(version 2) someone with expertise from the companyto provide a sworn opinion (something like \"the process to do X is Y\"), and answer questions in court.To what extent can a company formally require a generic employee to do that? To fix an idea, let's say that this is a computer-related data processing process that interests the court, and the person who can talk about it is an IT engineer.The scope is ideally ","answer":"Absent an agreement to the contrary, the employer can make expert testimony a requirement for further employment, and the employee can quit if this is not acceptable. As a practical matter, employees almost always agree to do so without any serious objections to testifying as experts on behalf of their employers.Also, U.S. courts distinguish between retained and non-retained expert testimony.A retained expert is someone testifying solely because they were hired to do so in particular case.A non-retained expert is someone who has personal knowledge of the events in the case who has expertise in an area and is being asked to testify about that personal knowledge in a manner informed by that person's expertise.A non-retained expert can be compelled to testify by subpoena, even if an agreement for that person to testify as an expert voluntarily is not reached.Many employees asked by an employer to provide expert testimony would fall in the category of a non-retained expert who could be compelled to testify about the matter from their personal knowledge in a manner informed by their expertise, even if they quit.But, a non-retained expert can only be compelled to testify at trial, not to cooperate in preparing for that testimony with an attorney for the employer or preparing a written report in advance of that testimony.Incidentally, it would be the rare exception to the rule for the written report of a retained expert witness in advance of their testimony at trial or in a deposition to make that report stating that opinion under oath. Typically, it would be signed but not sworn to by the expert.the court requires(version 1) the company (version 2) someone with expertise from thecompany to provide a sworn opinion (something like the process to doX is Y), and answer questions in court.In U.S. cases, it isn't the court that is proactively telling litigants what evidence they have to provide. The law tells litigants what has to be proved.Sometimes, in U.S. non-criminal litigation, expert testimony from someone is required to proven or disprove an element of a case.For example, in professional malpractice cases, someone with expertise in that profession must testify that the professional did or did not perform the work which is the basis of the lawsuit in a manner that falls below the standard of care for a professional of that type.Other times, expert testimony is one means of many possible means to prove a fact in the case.For example, one could prove lost profits by showing that a specific contract was lost by someone's action, or one could instead hire an expert to show what profits could have been earned if something was done."}
{"question":"In 1942 the Coconut Club in Boston Massachusetts caught fire in the  in United States history. The overcrowded club had sealed emergency exits and was filled drastically beyond capacity. When it burned it killed 492 people, and injuring 130 others.The owner, Barney Welasnky had connections to the Boston mob and thus was able to dodge safety standards and fire code using his connections. In fact, the club had been inspected by the Boston Fire Prevention and Safety department a  and declared safe.After the catastrophic fire Barney was charged and convicted for manslaughter due to his negligence and disregard for safety. But of the  492 victims only 19 charges were brought against him. The articles I've read said that the victims were chosen randomly to represent the dead, but I don't understand this happened.Ultimately, Barney was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but was pardoned after serving four years by the Governor of Massachusetts. He died of cancer shortly after the pardon.With this context, why might a subset of victims represent the total killed in a criminal court? What was the purpose of selecting 19 victims rather than all 492 or any other number?","answer":"Most likely, they chose enough victims to ensure a long prison term while having plenty of additional victims to charge if something went wrong at trial.  Plus limiting the number of victims limits the amount of repetitive testimony and evidence the prosecutors had to introduce proving the death of each victim.If you charge with 19 counts when there are 492 victims and something goes wrong at trial, whether you think but cant prove that the mob paid off a juror or whether you just get an oddball juror that votes to acquit, you can always pick some of the remaining 473 victims to bring charges.  The prosecutors could have failed in 24 straight trials for 19 charges of manslaughter and still been able to bring charges a 25th time (though that would have been highly unusual).If you charge a defendant with manslaughter, you have to prove the death of a particular person.  So there has to be evidence that Bob Smith went to the club, Bob Smiths body was recovered and identified, Bob Smith was autopsied and the cause of death was smoke inhalation, etc.  That gets repetitive after a time and jurors start thinking of the victims as numbers rather than people.  Limiting the number of charges makes it much easier to make the victims seem like distinct humans to the jury.  You can show pictures of the victims at trial and jurors can recognize particular individuals not just 1 of 492 dead people."}
{"question":"I was surprised to learn (in the background for the recent) that a Hong Kong resident can murder someone in Taiwanand go back to Hong Kong with no consequences(by the way, the murderer is actually imprisoned now in Hong Kong for a few years because he used the victim's money in Hong Kong, but I want to consider ahypothetical case for this question where he took no money).Since USA has no extradition treaty with Taiwan (though USA has many more extradition treaties than Hong Kong has), could a USA resident do the same thing without penalty?  In other words, even with proof sent from Taiwan and a confession, would USA really not beallowed to send the murderer to Taiwan or somehow penalize him?  This is hard to believe, so I wonder if there's a special law to deal with this in USA similarto the law being considered in Hong Kong.  I have reviewed  which makes me think the USA state might be important, so assume California.Also, every extradition treaty I have read is retroactive (meaning crimes beforethe treaty was signed can cause extradition).  Is that usually true?Is the new proposed law in Hong Kong retroactive?","answer":"The default is that countries are not required to repatriate alleged criminalsIt is one of the cardinal provisions of sovereignty that one country cannot 'reach into' another country's territory for any reason. However, countries can voluntarily repatriate an alleged criminal subject to their own legal systems allowing this. This can be ad-hoc or through a longer-term extradition treaty.Even where  is allowed, there are common things that will prevent it:Dual criminality - generally, the alleged crime must be a crime in both jurisdictions,Political crimes are usually not subject to extraditionPossibility of certain types of punishment - nations without the death penalty will generally not extradite for alleged capital crimes. This can be overcome with appropriate guarantees that such a penalty will not be sought.Jurisdictional issuesOwn citizens - some countries will not extradite their own citizens notably Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan), Russia, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and Syria.Fair trial standards - extradition will usually be refused when a fair trial cannot be expected."}
{"question":"In the United States, how egregious does an employees actions need to be to override  and hold the company blameless?A hypothetical example:  Bob is a full-time employee of Acme Services, LLC.  One of Bobs responsibilities for Acmes construction company clients is to verify that equipment rental invoices match delivery records before notifying the client to approve the invoices for payment.  For all of the clients except one, Bob follows the procedures properly.  For Client C, Bob does no verification and has the invoices paid as presented.  Neither Bob nor Acme realize any benefit from this action.  Acme conducts periodic audits of its client accounts (selected at random), and eventually the mishandling of Client Cs account is discovered.  Bob is fired (his excuse for his actions is that he disagreed with the political views of the owner of Client C).  A full audit of Client Cs account shows they have overpaid various vendors.If Client C sues Acme Services for damages, can Acme (or their liability insurance carrier) in turn sue Bob (with a reasonable chance of prevailing)?Can Client C sue Bob directly without also suing Acme?Could Bob or Acme (or both) face any criminal liability?","answer":"Acme is bound by Bob's actions so long as they were conducted with 'apparent authority' from the perspective of Client C and involved his work duties, even if he carried them out contrary to company policy - unless Client C knew for a fact that Bob was violating company policy and didn't have authority within the company to do so when he was doing these things.Acme, directly, or Acme's insurance carrier, in a subrogation suit after it has settled the claim from Client C, could probably sue Bob, especially if he willfully violated company policy for the purpose of harming client C. This is rarely done, but ultimately Bob owes duties to Acme which he violated which probably give rise to liability, although proving that and collecting the judgment would both be difficult. If Bob had authority within the organization to deviate from company policy, however, which he would have a good cause to claim that he did, this would be a full defense to such a suit, since Bob was always acting as a disclosed agent of Acme.Client C probably cannot sue Bob directly, whether or not it sues Acme. In contract matters (which this would include) a disclosed agent is not responsible for the acts he carries out on behalf of his principal. For example, an employee who signs a promissory note on behalf of a company in an official capacity as a disclosed agent of the company isn't responsible for paying the note.This is different than the rule in tort cases where the principal and anyone whose actions personally caused the tort caused the problem is liable.For example, if the employee got into a car accident that was his fault while he was driving on the job for the company, both the company and the employee would be liable to the person who was hurt.The circumstances that you describe sound more like a breach of contract than they do like a tort, so Bob would probably not have any personal liability to Client C.  Could Bob or Acme (or both) face any criminal liability?Unless Bob was the CEO or other senior officer of the company, Acme wouldn't face criminal liability, because he is too far down the chain of command to cause Acme the entity to have the requisite criminal intent.Realistically, failing to 'verify that equipment rental invoices match delivery records before notifying the client to approve the invoices for payment' does not amount to a crime no matter who does it. This might be careless or a breach of contract, but it is not fraud or theft because it lack the necessary criminal intent.If Bob actively photoshopped equipment rental invoices with a specific intent to defraud Client C, he would probably be criminally liable for fraud, although even that isn't an open and shut case as it still basically involves failure to perform a contract according to its terms and a mere breach of contract is generally not a crime unless you intended not to perform it in the first place, when you entered into the contract."}
{"question":"This is sort of related to  but in this case it is about a cell phone and about entering a government (IRS) office.I visited an IRS field office in Worcester (Massachusetts, USA) a couple of years back and had a somewhat off-putting experience with their security guard asking to see my cell phone. As in, 'in order for you to get in here, I want you to hand over your cell phone'.The request seemed a bit weird but as I had a need to talk to IRS personnel, I gave him my phone. The phone was one of those Nokia N900 smart phones. He turned it on, fiddled with the screen a bit (I thought at that time that maybe he was trying to scroll it to see what apps I had on it), and gave it back to me.This guard was not an official law enforcement person (police officer or sheriff or anything like that) but from some private security company.Anyway, this experience came up in a discussion later and what I wanted to know is what the U.S. (or MA) law says about requests to see another person's cell phone.In USA, or MA, would a security guard at an IRS office be legally allowed to demand to see my cell phone?","answer":"This sounds like the security official was trying to determine whether your phone was a bomb or not, rather than trying to determine what was on your phone.

Then he said 'I'm on active duty and I'm tasked with upholding federal law'.Is this in any way true? Can a soldier act as a law enforcement officer in a situation like this?

A soldier has no special authority. Indeed under the Posse Comitatus Act, the military has more restricted authority in such matters than citizens in general.  However note that the book doesn't say the soldier was justified. I do not find it implausible that a soldier might have believed that the military had such authority."}

Additionally note the United States tag.)","answer":"Because you indicate that you're from New Mexico, I'm assuming that you're asking about the rules governing curbside mailboxes used by the United States Postal Service.If that's the case, there are constraints on the design of signal flags, but they are far more focused on function and ergonomics than on aesthetics, and they can be found at , which says:The flag must be mounted on the right side when facing the mailbox from the front. The flag must not require a lift of more than 2 pounds of force to retract. Additionally, when actuated (signaling outgoing mail), the flag must remain in position until retracted by the carrier. The color of the flag must be in accordance with the requirements described in 3.9. The operating mechanism of the flag must not require lubrication and must continue to operate properly and positively (without binding or excessive free play) after being subjected to the test described in Section 4. Optionally, the flag may incorporate a self-lowering feature that causes it to automatically retract when the carrier service door is opened provided no additional effort is required of the carrier. The self-lowering feature cannot present protrusions or attachments and must not interfere with delivery operations in any manner or present hazardous features as specified in 3.1.The regulations provide preferred designs -- generally the rectangle you're likely used to -- but say that other designs may be permitted if they meet the other requirements.As I read it, this means USPS doesn't care if you use a circle or a square or a triangle or a swallowtail, as long as at isn't too heavy to lift, too flimsy to stand up on its own, etc."}

The term composition ofmatter relates to chemical compositions and may include mixtures ofingredients as well as new chemical compounds. These classes ofsubject matter taken together include practically everything that ismade by man and the processes for making the products.Interpretations of the statute by the courts have defined the limitsof the field of subject matter that can be patented, thus it has beenheld that the laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideasare not patentable subject matter.A patent cannot be obtained upon amere idea or suggestion.

{"question":"There is  of Congress passing legislation to block funding for a military strike on North Korea.My question is, what happens if the president orders an attack assuming it is within his authority? (Edit: I don't really intend this to be specific to an attack; if a defensive move is significantly different then please explain the difference.)Given that he's still commander-in-chief, would the military be obligated to work unpaid (or quit)?  Or would they be allowed to just ignore his order? Or would either Congress or the president's act be unconstitutional? Is there any precedent for something similar?","answer":"There is no way to actually know what would happen (primarily because we cannot know whether someone will actually sue), and a law might be broken with impunity (the violation could be ignored). We can at least say (somewhat) what the legal situation is, esp. what would constitute a violation of the law. To get to the bottom line, if there is any legal recourse, an aggrieved party would have to sue POTUS, and win the suit (compelling the president to do something different); or, the president could be impeached.   by Congress, but the court ruled that the complainants did not have standing. The court also found that  Congress certainly could have passed a law forbidding the use of U.S.  forces in the Yugoslav campaignand indeed there was such a measure, but it was defeated. The opinion continues:  Congress always retains appropriations authority and could have cut  off funds for the American role in the conflictand again, that was attempted, but failed. The court found that  Congress has a broad range of legislative authority it can use to stop  a President's war making, see generally John C. Yoo, The Continuation  of Politics by Other Means: The Original Understanding of War Powers,  84 CAL. L. REV. 167 (1996)so if suitable veto-proof legislation is passed, then a military action could be stopped (by specifically prohibiting use of US funds for military action). Or, at least it seems that way.  forbids an officer of the government from making or authorizing expenditures or obligations unless authorized by law. Consequently, when Congress fails to pass a budget, government operations must cease. This is related to Art. 1 Sect 9 Cl. 7 of the Constitution, which says  No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of  appropriations made by lawThe aforementioned statute does not allow an officer to create an obligation: it does not prohibit an officer from doing a thing, which would ordinarily imply an expenditure or obligation. Notice that while previous federal shutdowns did result in unpaid furloughs to civilian workers, it did not completely close down the military. The  explains  In case of a potential government shutdown, the Department of Defense  has no legal authority to pay any personnel - military or civilian -  for the days during which the government is shut down...  Military members cannot be paid for duty performed after the  expiration of the current CRA on September 30th.  Once a CRA or an  appropriations act is signed into law, normal disbursement of military  pay will resume.(Congress could of course authorize back pay when it's all sorted out, and they did). If Congress were to specifically prohibit any expenditure of US funds for action against North Korea, that might simply mean that soldiers would be ordered to work without pay.It is unquestionably within the power of the president to order soldiers into combat. I don't believe that there has been a case pertaining to the power of the president to compel soldiers to fight if they are not paid, but it is pretty much unimaginable that the courts would hold that the president lacks authority to order soldiers to work without pay. Also, you can't just quit the military: it's not at-will employment.  (which is written by the commander-in-chief), and nothing makes it unlawful to give an order to solder if they are not being paid.All that said, if there is implemented veto-proof opposition to military action against North Korea, there is almost certainly the number of votes needed to impeach. An impeachment is not subject to any judicial review whatsoever, so a president who went against such a strongly-supported no-funding law would likely also get the required 2\/3 vote to remove."}

Let's call this the \"original work.\" An adaptation (known as \"derivative work\" in the United States) of the original work was later published in Country B since the work is in the public domain. The author of this adaptation chose to license their work with a public-domain equivalent license (perhaps ).My understanding of copyright is that it grants the author an exclusive right to distribute their work in whatever manner they'd like for some amount of time (determined by the copyright duration in a country).Can a person in Country A legally use the adapted work? I'm assuming no, but then does that mean that the author of the work created in Country B does not technically have all the rights to the work they created, since they have no control over whether their work can be distributed in Country A? If that is the case, then would these rights be \"granted\" to the author of the adaptation when the copyright finally expires in Country A?I am a bit confused.

I'm assuming no [...],Basically correct, whoever holds rights to the original work could theoretically still assert their rights in Country A on any portion of the derivative work that was part of the original.[...] does that mean that the author of the work created in Country B does not technically have all the rights to the work they created, since they have no control over whether their work can be distributed in Country A?This is splitting hairs, but while the derivative author has the rights given to them by copyright law, they aren't absolute. In particular in this case, regardless of which country, they still don't have any inherent exclusive rights over the original work. With respect to country B, those exclusive rights have expired so they don't bind the derivative author, but they haven't expired in country A.If that is the case, then would these rights be granted to the author of the adaptation when the copyright finally expires in Country A?Again splitting hairs, but its more helpful to express that no rights are actively granted by the expiration of copyright in Country A, it's just that no one holds those rights anymore (here there might be a language issue too, generally in copyright law rights refers to those exclusive actions that may be taken by the copyright holder, and not always to the right i.e. freedom for someone to do something)."}
{"question":"Although ?Each country has a 7% quota, which might seem superficially fair except for the fact that the population of countries is highly variable.Currently, Chinese and Indian immigrants have to wait 5-10 years for a greencard, whereas immigrants from some 100+ other countries can get a greencard almost immediately.For example: Suppose immigrants born in China, India, and Sweden are sponsored for an employment-based greencard for the same position. The Swedes will get it within 6 months while the Chinese will have to wait for roughly 5 years and the Indians will likely wait 10 years.If discrimination based on national origin is illegal in employment, then how is it legal to discriminate on that characteristic in employment-based immigration systems?","answer":"In fact, the immigration quotas do not discriminate. The described limit is that 'No more than 7 percent of the visas may be issued to natives of any one independent country in a fiscal year; no more than 2 percent may issued to any one dependency of any independent country'. All countries get the same upper limit. Additionally, anti-discrimination laws are subject matter specific: they exist because Congress passed a law that prohibits using race as a basis for employing a person (which Congress can do because of the Commerce Clause). Congress has not passed any such law pertaining to granting of visas. There is a path of reasoning that could lead to concluding that national quotas violate anti-discrimination laws, based on an 'effects test' (). It appears to be a fact that an applicant for a visa has a much higher probability of being denied a visa is their country of origin is China or India, as opposed to Sweden, which one could spin into a disparate impact argument. In order for this argument to become the law, there would have to be a case brought to the federal courts to the effect that national quotas are illegal, and as far as I know there has never been such a case. There are no provisions in anti-discrimination legislation that support a disparate impact doctrine in immigration, and pretty clear evidence that it was not congressionally intended since Title 8 Ch. 12 clearly calls for nation-based quotas.A final point: '' is based on 'an individual's, or his or her ancestor's, place of origin; or because an individual has the physical, cultural or linguistic characteristics of a national origin group'. A Swedish citizen of 'Chinese national origin' is subject to the Swedish quota, not the Chinese quota, thus the discrimination is based on country of citizenship, not national origin."}

In this case, if we sign a contract saying that I give him the refrigerator but he doesn't give me anything, is there consideration?In other words: if a single action is mutually beneficial to both parties, is that action on its own valid consideration?","answer":"Actually, mutual benefit is the underlying premise of contract law.Your analysis of this contract is probably deficient, since you didn't recognize the actual values being exchanged. The fridge has objective value, but subjectively it seems to you that it has no value since you don't want a storage chest or a bunch or parts. It you want it thrown away, it will cost you actual money to be free of it (which I assume has subjective value to you, in addition to its clear objective value). The neighbor offers a useful service, so you get something in exchange for that which you give.If you are bothering to write a formal contract for this, you would include some verbiage that says that you give the fridge and he takes it away."}
{"question":"According to 197. Homicide is also justifiable when committed by any person in any of the following cases:When resisting any attempt to murder any person, or to commit a felony, or to do some great bodily injury upon any person; or,I thought that only a very few instances of grave personal threat justified lethal force. This section of law seems to say that it can be used to 'resist' any felony. There are many felonies, but non-violent ones such as forgery I wouldn't think justified lethal force. Does this clause apply to nonviolent felonies?(Inspired by an uneducated reading of this question: )","answer":"No. The language in question dates from when felony denoted a much more serious class of crimes than it does today; traditionally, felony essentially meant capital crime. Since then, California courts have narrowed the clause's meaning through caselaw. Incidentally, the provision in question appears in multiple state penal codes (it was a traditional common-law rule), and they have all restricted its meaning.In 1961, a California appeals court considered this issue in People v. Jones (). The court ruled thatIt is true that Penal Code, section 197, subdivision 1, does provide that homicide is justifiable when resisting an attempt to commit a felony. But the section does no more than codify the common law and should be read in the light of it. Taken at face value, and without qualification, it represents an oversimplification of the law today.The authorities generally rely on Blackstone for the earliest expression of the rule. He rationalized it in terms of no killing being justified to prevent crime unless the offense was punishable by death. (4 Blackstone's Commentaries, pp. 180-182.) But in those days all felonies were capital offenses.Perhaps the leading American case on the point is Storey v. State, 71 Ala. 329, 336-341, where the early law is reviewed and rejected, and the application of the rule limited to the commission of felonies that involve a danger of great personal harm, or some atrocious crime attempted to be committed by force. This limitation is today generally recognized.This case involved a violent felony (wife-beating), but it was a felony because the legislature wanted to punish what would otherwise be misdemeanor assault more seriously in a domestic setting. As such,The punishment provided by a statute is not necessarily an adequate test as to whether life may be taken for in some situations it is too artificial and unrealistic. We must look further into the character of the crime, and the manner of its perpetration (see Storey v. State, supra). When these do not reasonably create a fear of great bodily harm, as they could not if defendant apprehended only a misdemeanor assault, there is no cause for the exaction of a human life."}

Would Bob still be responsible for the traffic infraction his wife committed? Can the authorities compel Bob to say who was driving? What happens if he doesn't know who was driving?","answer":"Bob, as the car's registered keeper, will get a  which stipulates he has to name the driver at the relevant time.Although he cannot be compelled to name her, he commits an offence if he doesn't do do so -  unless he satisfies the due diligence statutory defence at , Road Trafic Act 1988:A shall not be guilty of an offence ... if he shows that he did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained who the driver of the vehicle was."}

{"question":"If a person is arrested at airport or pulled over by cop for a warrant issued coz of an unpaid red light ticket, how long is the person kept in Jail ?From my understanding he\/she is kept in jail, until the court date. But how long is the wait for court date ?Can such a person pay the bail on arrest and never be put behind bars for such petty crime? Looking for answers specifically for USA.","answer":"This is highly dependent on your specific city \/ locality. Sometimes the local jurisdiction will have a preset bail amount for certain crimes, in which case you could immediately post that amount and get out. But not all crimes have these preset amounts, and not all jurisdictions use them. You'd pretty much just have to find out. Failing to pay a ticket is usually a misdemeanor offense, and is more likely to have a preset bail amount, so you will probably be able to get out quickly.If there is no preset bail amount for the crime, you may have to wait a while. Bail is not set by the jail, police department, or other detention facility. It is set by a judge, which means once you have been processed at the facility, you will be held until you are able to see a judge for your bail hearing. The judge must set the bail amount, at which time you would be able to post bail and get out.The amount of time you spend waiting varies greatly. In some jurisdictions you will see a judge within 24 hours (if not that day, the following day) and other can take 48 or even 72 hours, but other things can also affect it. A lot of courts don't operate on weekends or holidays, which could extend how long you have to wait for your bail hearing. You will likely spend your time waiting for this hearing behind bars, there's just no avoiding it.Note that your bail hearing is not your actual court hearing. It is simply a short hearing where the charges are read to you and you submit a plea. If you don't plead guilty or no contest, the judge assigns a bail amount and you are returned to the jail to either wait until your court date or post bail."}
{"question":"I had a guy show up at my house knowing that I was already suing his car insurance company, for a car accident; he hit my car passing on left while homeowner was turning left into their driveway. Would this be considered an act of intimidation\/trespassing\/act of aggression towards a victim if he asked me why I was suing his insurance company?What other offenses should I be looking into also?","answer":"It would not be trespassing until you told him to get off your property and he refused to leave.In general, none of these facts obviously give rise to any criminal or civil offenses. It is not generally improper to come to someone's house and discuss something that you are unhappy about with them.If one engaged in conduct related to the manner in which the communication took place, for example, pointing a firearm at you, that conduct could be a crime, but simply confronting someone verbally and in person at home is not improper or criminal."}
{"question":"Can a lawyer in one state give advice to a client in another state if only federal law is relevant?","answer":"It's a more complicated question to answer than you would think. The relevant rule of professional conduct is Rule 5.5 (which has the same numbering in every U.S. jurisdiction, but not identical substantive language).Generally, one can represent a client based in the state (even if it has offices in many states including one where the lawyer's office is) where a lawyer practices anywhere the lawyer can competently do so. Tribunal admission in tax and patent practice is national, but in Article III federal courts have admission to practice on a court by court basis.Part of the issue is that no fact pattern that I client is in is ever 100% federal or 100% state with some rare exceptions like immigration court or federal tax court or patent cases. Most client situations have both state and federal dimensions that a competent lawyer is aware of and counsels on, even if the client perceives it as a federal law issue and even if the federal law issue may be the most important one.The rule and the official comments in Colorado are as follows:Rule 5.5. Unauthorized Practice of Law; Multijurisdictional Practice of Law (quoted in pertinent part which also contains provisions related to employing disbarred lawyers and paralegals):Colorado Rules of Professional ConductLaw Firms and AssociationsAs amended through Rule Change 2018(6), effective April 12, 2018(a) A lawyer shall not:(1) practice law in this jurisdiction without a license to practicelaw issued by the Colorado Supreme Court unless specificallyauthorized by C.R.C.P. 204 or C.R.C.P. 205 or federal or tribal law;(2) practice law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates theregulations of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; . . .COMMENT[1] The definition of the practice of law is established by law andvaries from one jurisdiction to another. In order to protect thepublic, persons not admitted to practice law in Colorado cannot holdthemselves out as lawyers in Colorado or as authorized to practice lawin Colorado. Rule 5.5(a)(1) recognizes that C.R.C.P. 204 and C.R.C.P.205 permit lawyers to practice law in accordance with their terms inColorado without a license from the Colorado Supreme Court. Lawyersmay also be permitted to practice law within the physical boundariesof the State, without such a license, where they do so pursuant toFederal or tribal law. Such practice does not constitute a violationof the general proscription of Rule 5.5(a)(1). . .C.R.C.P. 204 and 205 pertain to the practice of law by law students in clinical courses with suitable sponsors and lawyer supervision.The American Bar Association Model Rule contains an additional subsection not adopted in Colorado (which is adopted in a majority of jurisdictions) which states:(c) A lawyer admitted in another United States jurisdiction, and notdisbarred or suspended from practice in any jurisdiction, may providelegal services on a temporary basis in this jurisdiction that:(1) are undertaken in association with a lawyer who is admitted topractice in this jurisdiction and who actively participates in thematter;(2) are in or reasonably related to a pending or potential proceedingbefore a tribunal in this or another jurisdiction, if the lawyer, or aperson the lawyer is assisting, is authorized by law or order toappear in such proceeding or reasonably expects to be so authorized;(3) are in or reasonably related to a pending or potentialarbitration, mediation, or other alternative resolution proceeding inthis or another jurisdiction, if the services arise out of or arereasonably related to the lawyer's practice in a jurisdiction in whichthe lawyer is admitted to practice and are not services for which theforum requires pro hac vice admission; or(4) are not within paragraphs (c) (2) or (c)(3) and arise out of orare reasonably related to the lawyer's practice in a jurisdiction inwhich the lawyer is admitted to practice."}

{"question":"I have been helping a nonprofit by developing a piece of software that they needed.  The software is more-or-less built to their specs in a \"functional\" way, but I wrote 100% of the code: they are not programmers.Anyhow, we didn't make any kind of contract at the beginning verbally or otherwise.  Who owns the copyright to all of this?  Do they have any rights to it at all for providing \"ideas\"?","answer":"The Organization Does Not Own the CopyrightAs you were clearly not an employee of the organization, and did not have a specific contract with them, this was not a work-made-for-hire (WFH). Therefore, the copyright initially belonged to the author, in this case the programmer, that is you. That being so, it would require a written document to transfer the copyright to another during your lifetime.In future there should be a written agreement in such a case, spelling out just what rights are to be retained by whom. It can save lots of trouble.The organization would have an implied license to use the software. The terms of this would be defined by the conduct of the parties, and might be a matter of dispute. Probably there would be a non-exclusive license without any fee or ending date. Probably there would be no license to distribute to others unless you explicitly grant one.<h3>Specific US Laws<\/h3> defines a WFH:A work made for hire is(1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or(2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire. For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, a supplementary work is a work prepared for publication as a secondary adjunct to a work by another author for the purpose of introducing, concluding, illustrating, explaining, revising, commenting upon, or assisting in the use of the other work, such as forewords, afterwords, pictorial illustrations, maps, charts, tables, editorial notes, musical arrangements, answer material for tests, bibliographies, appendixes, and indexes, and an instructional text is a literary, pictorial, or graphic work prepared for publication and with the purpose of use in systematic instructional activities. (emphasis added) provides that:(a) Initial Ownership.  Copyright in a work protected under this title vests initially in the author or authors of the work. The authors of a joint work are coowners of copyright in the work.(b) Works Made for Hire.

{"question":"I have heard that a law passed in one of the above years says a doctor is required to give medical attention to any born-alive infant.  I'm just trying to find the law","answer":"You are thinking of the  which doesn't precisely say what you suggested that it did.It says in its entirety (1 USC \u00a7 8):  (a) In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any  ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative  bureaus and agencies of the United States, the words person, human  being, child, and individual, shall include every infant member  of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of  development.    (b) As used in this section, the term born alive, with respect to a  member of the species homo sapiens, means the complete expulsion or  extraction from his or her mother of that member, at any stage of  development, who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a  beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement  of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has  been cut, and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs  as a result of natural or induced labor, cesarean section, or induced  abortion.    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm, deny,  expand, or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any  member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born  alive as defined in this section.It does not 'says a doctor is required to give medical attention to any born-alive infant.' It basically says that if a fetus is breathing or has a pulse or is moving voluntarily, after leaving the womb in a failed induced abortion, that for purposes of all federal laws and regulations, this counts as a born alive infant. But, any application of this definition must flow from other federal laws and regulations, and in practice, few federal laws or regulations impose any notable duties in this situation which is mostly governed by state law.Notably, federal law does not have a general purpose homicide or child abuse statute, although it does have a compulsory emergency medical treatment act that applies to emergency rooms only (which is a place where induced abortions are very rarely conducted).In particular, since there is no general purpose homicide statute in federal law, it does not prohibit infanticide."}

However, less serious crimes usually do have limitation periods that are meaningful. Sometimes they are broken into two categories, as in the UK, sometimes several categories with different periods, as in Germany.See  for reasons why limitations exist.

{"question":"I was recently terminated for allegedly violating the company attendance policy (claiming I did not contact my manager at least 30 minutes prior to start of my shift, which is a false accusation, but thats a different issue). According to the HR manager, they have disciplinary documents containing my signature, yet I never once was written up or asked to sign anything regarding discipline. I dont even know what is contained in these documents because: 1. I never saw them. 2. HR refuses to allow me to see copies because the state of Ohio does not require them to do so.Given that an exact replica of my signature was placed [not penned] electronically on a document, would the burden of proof fall on the company? And if so, what reparations can I pursue for having lost my employment as a result of unauthorized use of my electronic signature?","answer":"  how Do I prove unauthorized use of my signature?Proving a negative (here, the fact you did not sign the disciplinary documents) is usually very difficult, if possible at all.Instead, most likely your proof would consist of circumstantial evidence that discredits the employer's allegations. To that effect, you would need to subpoena the employer for records and take depositions of individuals who are involved in the matter.Subpoenas and depositions lead to a large portion of evidence that ensues during discovery proceedings in a lawsuit. Even if legislation does not require the employer to produce a copy of your file(s) upon your request, the employer could be ordered by the court to produce a copy of these and other records (provided that the judge does not arbitrarily quash your subpoena, and that it does not fail to enforce its orders).  would the burden of proof fall on the company?No. The employer would produce (file in court) a copy of the documents he alleges you signed, and it would be your burden to prove that your signature was falsified.  what reparations can I pursue for having lost my employment as a result of unauthorized use of my electronic signature?Cause and method are different things. The unauthorized use of your signature is not what caused your termination. Based on your description, it was just the employer's method to force your termination under an appearance of legitimacy, possibly with intent to cause you unwarranted harm. That being said, you might be awarded lost wages.If the pretext for your termination is traceable to a false statement of fact, you might also have a claim of defamation, for which some jurisdictions purportedly award exemplary and punitive damages if certain factual and procedural conditions are met. See :  The law of Ohio is clear on when punitive damages may be awarded:    [P]unitive or exemplary damages are not recoverable from a defendant  in question in a tort action unless both of the following apply: (1)  The actions or omissions of that defendant demonstrate malice * * *,  or that defendant as principal or master authorized, participated in,  or ratified actions or omissions of an agent or servant that so  demonstrate; [and] (2) The plaintiff in question has adduced proof of  actual damages that resulted from actions or omissions as described in  division (B)(1) of this section. (Emphasis added.) R.C. \u00a7 2315.21(B).Interestingly, Ohio case law employs a different meaning of the term actual malice (compared with most other jurisdictions). See Sky at 834:  Actual malice, necessary for an award of punitive damages, is (1) that state of mind under which a person's conduct is characterized by hatred, ill will or a spirit of revenge, or (2) a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons that has a great probability of causing substantial harm.Your claim of defamation would be against the person(s) who uttered the falsehoods, not the company.The Ohio penal code might also sanction the falsification, although it is hard to assess the chances for the attorney general to prosecute the person(s) who falsified the records."}
{"question":"There's employee owned companies, but I'm not looking to start anything quite so big. Is there a form of company like an LLC that's straight forward to file that will allow it to be employee owned?","answer":"To quote the IRS page at:Owners of an LLC are called members. Most states do not restrictownership, so members may include individuals, corporations, otherLLCs and foreign entities. There is no maximum number of members. Moststates also permit single-member LLCs, those having only one owner.Your particular state may have some additional restrictions.  In general, however, members of an LLC work for the LLC although that is not a requirement."}
{"question":"Curious American here. You may have heard we have our own troubles on this side of the pond.From widely reported news, I understand that Parliament voted overwhelmingly against the PM's plan for Brexit, but then had a no confidence vote that did not pass. If it had, it would have triggered snap elections. Reports suggested the MPs in her party did not vote no confidence because then in the snap election their seat would be at risk.  Could they vote her out as PM and vote in a different PM? In other words, keep the composition of Parliament the same until the next fixed election but change their leader sooner.","answer":"You have to distinguish between the Tory party and the UK parliament. The UK parliament just had a vote of no confidence against Theresa May and lost. Had they won, parliament would have had to come up with a different government (for example the same government except for a different PM, or a government formed by the current opposition) that would have a majority to rule, or there would be new elections.The Tory party could legally do lots of things, but they are bound by their party rules. They had a vote of no confidence against Theresa May maybe a month or so ago, and she won. According to the Tory party rules, there cannot be another such vote for one year, so right now and for the next eleven months, they can't replace her. If that vote a month ago had not happened, they could. But that is all not because of some law, but because of the rules this party set for itself."}
{"question":"You might think someone must be stupid to sign a contract without even reading it. Yet I see it happen all the time, when contracts are just too long and there's no time to read stuff you suppose you already know. Typical examples are contracts you 'accept' online, like TOS's and privacy policies. Nobody reads that. And the funny thing is that the other party usually knows you haven't read it. Websites know that nobody reads their huge TOS's or privacy policies, and it has also been demonstrated (researches, polls, articles). And the salesman telling you 'just sign here, it's the usual stuff', they know you haven't read it because they saw you sign it without reading it.In the case of online contracts, you don't even have a copy of them, so the other party could change the terms and you wouldn't even have a way to know it. Stackexchange could tell me that I agreed to post at least a question per month, or my profile would be deleted. Well, did I agree to that? Maybe, who knows, I don't know what was really written in the TOS when I clicked, and now they might have changed the terms and there could be no trace of the old contract.  So are these contracts valid? What makes a contract valid and binding?If jurisdiction is important, I'm interested in the EU and the US.","answer":"This applies to contract law in US and many (if not all) of EU jurisdictions.  Is a contract valid if one of the party doesn't even read it?Yes. A meeting of the minds is presumed as long as the contract has been signed.The party's deliberate choice not to read the clauses does not release him or her from the obligations acquired at the moment the contract was willfully signed. Although contract law typically refers to entering a contract knowingly, a more correct phrasing would be that the party knew or should have known the clauses when deciding to enter the contract.  In the case of online contracts, you don't even have a copy of them,  so the other party could change the terms and you wouldn't even have a  way to know it.Technically one can 'always' (?) save a copy of the online contract (by clicking on 'Save As ...', printing the document, taking a screenshot, etc.). It is just doubtful that people take that precaution, as it seems unprecedented or very unusual for the draftsman to alter the contract retroactively and\/or without proper (and timely) notice to the other party.Assuming that no one else saved a copy of the contract, the situation you outline would require some sort of forensic analysis to ascertain whether the contract was improperly altered. That analysis might be complemented by scrutinizing the parties' conduct and the timing of the events at issue."}
{"question":"As a business expense, Alice initiates a bank transfer to a company on 30 Dec 2022 and the money reaches the company some business days later, in 2023. For U.S. tax purposes - assuming Alice files using the cash basis - can Alice claim the deduction on her 2022 tax return?","answer":"Since Alice uses CASH ACCOUNTING expenses are accounted for when they are paid by her, not when someone else receives it.  So in your hypothetical, when she initiated the transfer would be the date that the payment is considered to be made.On the other hand, ACCRUAL ACCOUNTING means that Alice would account for the expense when it was made.  Generally this would be earlier than the CASH date.But either way, she would account for it in 2022 based on what you said above."}

Can the police go and talk to his wife without reading her her Miranda rights?For example, if they don't notify her of her right to stay silent and she admits (in an interrogation room, but without herself ever being suspected of a crime) that she washed blood out of his clothes, can that admission be used in court?","answer":"If she's subject to a custodial interrogation, they're generally obligated to Mirandize her, regardless of whether she's a suspect. If they don't, that would make her statements there inadmissible in a case against her (for abetting or destroying evidence, for example), but I don't think it would make those statements inadmissible in a case against the husband himself."}
{"question":"What should Bryan Smith have done when two burglars came to his house?Two burglars came to his house. He shot them, and they died.The prosecutor argued that by removing trucks from the premise he is 'baiting' burglars.Is it illegal to remove trucks from premises?Now that the burglars are in his house, what should he have done? I still do not understand the verdict. I mean, do you lose your right to defend yourself if you make it look like your house is uninhabited? Are you obligated to signal to would-be burglars that you will shoot them?In the case of Bryan Smith case, has the prosecutor established that the removal of his truck is done solely for baiting burglars?One controversy in the case is that after he shot a burglar, he finish the job.I do not know how much of this got into a jury. However, I would have done the same if I were him. Soldiers in wars double tap because enemies they think are death (not just injured in legs), may actually still be alive and kill. There are cases of people stop beating up robbers thinking he won, only to have the robbers' friend stab him in the back.For all Bryan Smith knows, those teenagers could be assassins sent by gangs to kill him. The boy and the girl may bring life grenade they can activate for suicide bombing. It may not be. But how does he knows?The probability is small. May be 1%, or 2%. Still, why should a home owner risk his life for life of two worthless burglars? The safest thing to do is to just kill the burglars.Why take unnecessary risks when your life is in danger by some people that's obviously up to no good?","answer":"No, you can't lure people into your home with the intent of killing, shooting, whatever, them. For the seminal case on setting traps for people, see  where a guy was found liable for battery when a trespasser set off a spring gun that had been set in an abandoned house to 'catch' burglars and the trespasser was severely injured.For a more recent version, where a man left his garage door open to tempt a person who he suspected had stolen from him, then was waiting and shot the kid when he came by, see the story of  and his conviction for homicide.Nothing about moving trucks is or random houses that simply 'look abandoned' has any meaning here, further than the truck-moving thing actually tended to show that the homeowner took deliberate steps to falsely portray a situation in order to take his intended action against those who he expected to act as a result of that false portrayal. Addendum:Instead of the above being as relevant as I thought it was, that the case turned more on the premeditation fact of the shooter. The luring of the victims is important in that it tends to demonstrate the shooter's intent.This is really about intent. So, Bryan Smith, just like the defendant in Katko v. Briney, which I cited above, was found liable because of his criminal intent - his plan to do what he did. See this passage from Katko:  On the other hand, where the intruder may pose a danger to the  inhabitants of a dwelling, the privilege of using such a device to  repel has been recognized by most authorities, and the mere setting  thereof in the dwelling has not been held to create liability for an  injury as a matter of law. In such cases intent and the reasonableness  of the force would seem relevant to liability.    Although I am aware of the often-repeated statement that personal  rights are more important than property rights, where the owner has  stored his valuables representing his life's accumulations, his  livelihood business, his tools and implements, and his treasured  antiques as appears in the case at bar, and where the evidence is  sufficient to sustain a finding that the installation was intended  only as a warning to ward off thieves and criminals, I can see no  compelling reason why the use of such a device alone would create  liability as a matter of law."}
{"question":"Suppose that out there in the web there is a project, let's call it <PROJECT NAME>, licensed under  or, at the end user's discretion, above.An external contributor (not officially affiliated with <PROJECT NAME>) submit a merge request to the project. \"Submit a merge request\" means that he writes some code that substantially improves <PROJECT NAME>, uploaded his code on <PROJECT NAME>'s website and asks the maintainers of <PROJECT NAME> (from now on, just \"the maintainers\") to merge his code with <PROJECT NAME>'s code.The contributor code starts with the following notice:This file is part of <PROJECT NAME>.Copyright 20XX-20YY <CONTRIBUTOR NAME> <CONTRIBUTOR SURNAME> <><PROJECT NAME> is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modifyit under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License aspublished by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of theLicense, or (at your option) any later version.<PROJECT NAME> is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, butWITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Suppose that one maintainer demands that the contributor call some functions from <SOFTWARE X>. But the contributor thinks that basing his work on <SOFTWARE X> will substantially decrease the quality of his work. Furthermore, the contributor notices that this maintainer is also a maintainer of <SOFTWARE X>.After the initial merge request, the contributor continues to work on his code, which, if merged, would substantially improve <PROJECT NAME> capabilities. This goes on for years. The contributor has written a lot of code, millions of lines, over several years, that substantially improves <PROJECT NAME>, while repeatedly asking the maintainers to merge.After years of code writing, the contributor asks for the final time the maintainers to merge. They don't.The contributor is finally fed up, remove the merge request, delete his code, and ask for his code not to be used anymore in any way by <PROJECT NAME>.The contributor is banned from the project and kicked out from the community by the maintainers.The maintainers, who have saved the contributor's code in their computers, open another pull request with his code. This means that they re-upload on the web what the contributor has deleted. They modify a small portion of the code (2\/3 lines) to use <SOFTWARE X>. Then they merge.Is it legal for the maintainers to do that?Relevant to answering this question may be the explanation :Some open source projects, generally large ones with corporatebacking, occasionally have whats known as a Contributor LicenseAgreement. This document explains any additional requirements andrules for submitting source code to a project, and will usually have aclause explaining that the submitter is granting their copyright tothe projects parent entitySo we will suppose that <PROJECT NAME> does not have any such Contributor License Agreement.Can be argued in court that the contributor did not offer the license to the public indiscriminately. He did offer his Merge Request and related license to the maintainers. By not merging the pull request, the maintainers did not effectively accepted the license. Now the contributor has withdraw his code, and so there is no licensing offering anymore.

{"question":"I am an academic in a field where we explore the performance of materials for a particular application based on just a few metrics. Right now, there is no central repository of this information. My idea was to fix this by building a website that maintains a plot of each metric (potentially from multiple papers) for each material system.My question is this: a typical article in my field will have a figure with x\/y datapoints of the performance metric for the material being studied. I have access to journals through my university and would like to download papers and digitize the datapoints from the figures using a tool such as .

{"question":" is a 1987 film. The part of the plot I'm interested in is:Daniel \"Dan\" Gallagher is a successful, happily-married Manhattan lawyer whose work leads him to meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Forrest, an editor for a publishing company. While his wife, Beth, and daughter, Ellen, are out of town for the weekend, Dan has an affair with Alex. Although it was initially understood by both as just a fling, Alex begins to cling to him.After leaving unexpectedly in the middle of the night, Dan reluctantly spends the following day with Alex after she persistently asks him over. When Dan attempts to suddenly leave again, she cuts her wrists in a manipulative ploy to force him to stay. He helps her bandage the cuts, stays with her overnight to make sure she is all right, and leaves in the morning. Although Dan believes the affair to be forgotten, Alex shows up at his office one day to apologize for her behavior and invites him to a performance of Madame Butterfly, but he politely turns her down. She then continues to call him at his office until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls.Alex then phones his home at all hours, claiming that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. After he changes his home phone number, she shows up at his apartment (which is for sale) and meets Beth, feigning interest as a buyer. Later that night, Dan goes to Alex's apartment to confront her, which results in a scuffle. In response, she replies that she will not be ignored.Dan moves his family to Bedford, but this does not deter Alex. She has a tape recording delivered to him filled with verbal abuse. She stalks him in a parking garage, pours acid onto his car, ruining the engine, and follows him home one night to spy on him, Beth, and Ellen from the bushes in their yard: the sight of the family makes her sick to her stomach. Her obsession escalates further when Dan approaches the police to apply for a restraining order against Alex (claiming that it is \"for a client\"). The lieutenant claims that he cannot violate her rights without probable cause, and that the \"client\" has to own up to his adultery.I highlight the relevant part. It's surprising to me that Dan, who's obviously being harassed, cannot get a restraining order against Alex. Is the lieutenant correct when he says he cannot authorize a restraining order because it would violate Alex's rights, unless Dan admits to adultery?","answer":"1: What's the correct process to get a restraining order?The police aren't involved in the formal process, although sometimes people go to the police and are told that they have to go to a judge instead.The aggrieved plaintiff presents an ex parte affidavit or makes statement in person under oath to a duty judge (who often asks clarifying questions). If this statements states a basis for a protection order one issues with a prompt return date (a week or two). At the return date the order either becomes final if the defendant doesn't show up, is vacated if the plaintiff doesn't show up, or is tried in an evidentiary hearing if both show up.Of course, a court order is ultimately just a piece of paper and there is no legal recourse against the government if they don't successfully stop the person restrained from doing something.Also enforcement of restraining orders was a lot more lax in 1987 than it is today, and men asking for restraining orders were taken less seriously then, than they are now, by most judges.2: Can Dan keep his adultery secret during that process?Not really.In the initial ex parte hearing, Dan can probably tell the story artfully in a way that hides the adultery, but in the adversarial hearing, if there is one, the other side (or their lawyer) can ask him under oath about the affair and he has to answer truthfully in a public court hearing setting.3: Is it plausible that Dan's family and friends don't learn about that process?Yes. Unless he's famous enough to make the newspapers (which in a decent sized city is pretty famous), and if he initiates the process, the only person who gets formal notice before the order issues is the court, and if the court issues the initial order, the only person who gets notice is the defendant.If Dan doesn't call family or friends as witnesses and don't tell his workplace why he's at court, nobody is told. It isn't a secret. It's a matter of public record that could be subsequently discovered at any time. But there is no active means of notification of friends and family in the short term.Realistically, Dan might ask a cop or a lawyer what to do, get accurate or inaccurate information, and decide not to pursue it for fear of creating sworn proof of his affair at a hearing. Cops love to provide legal advice that they aren't qualified to dispense.Dan's concern is particularly relevant because this happened in New York State in 1987 when New York State didn't have no fault divorce at the time, and the outcome of divorce proceedings on the merits for property division and alimony and custody would have been heavily influenced by marital fault in the divorce case.Revealing an affair under oath as he might have been required to do at a hearing would have crushed him in a subsequent divorce outcome if his wife found out and decided to divorce him."}
{"question":"Given the statement, 'John failed to respond to a criminal court summons, and he moved out of the state.'Assuming that it is false that John failed to respond to a criminal court summons, but it is true that he moved out of state, but a year before charges were filed (in other words, it is true that he moved out of state just not for the purpose of evading the summons).As presented in the statement above, is the statement 'and he moved out of the state' a defamatory and should it therefore be plead as such in a libel complaint as written above?","answer":"For the statement to be defamatory, it must also be false. The statement is literally true because it states that plaintiff moves out of the state, which you stipulate is true. Case dismissed. However, one might argue that the statement implies another false statement, something like 'B moved out of state in order to avoid a criminal summons'. If the statement had been 'John failed to respond to a criminal court summons, and then he moved out of the state' the implication is even stronger. A damaging implication of a statement can be defamatory, see for example  and citations therein. In your jurisdiction, the courts would have to recognize defamation by implication (which I will assume). In the present case, the principle appealed to in Cochran would be apt: 'If the article is capable of two meanings, one libelous and one not, the case should properly go to the jury'. In that case, 'the test is the effect which the article is fairly calculated to produce and impression it would naturally engender in the mind of the average person'.It is very easy to establish that a statement of the above type ('A, and B') naturally engenders in the mind of the average person that the events A and B took place in that order (millions of students have lost points in Logic 150 because they misunderstand the commutativity of conjunction)  given the statement, it is natural to conclude that the events took place in that order, and that is plainly false. It is a little less easy but still possible to establish that the average person would conclude that the reason for moving out of state was to evade a summons, again a false statement. Whether or not plaintiff was harmed by the statement can't be judged from the above sentence  it does not constitute defamation per se. It is not a crime to move out of state."}
{"question":"I think committing treason, in the U.S. constitution, can involve giving aid & comfort to our enemies.  What if the enemy gives aid & comfort to you instead?  Is that treason?  Is it covered by a different crime?(This is inspired by a recent Presidential candidate asking, maybe sarcastically, a foreign power for help over his opponent's documentation.)","answer":"  What if the enemy gives aid &amp; comfort to you instead? Is that treason?  Is it covered by a different crime?This is not treason on the part of the recipient, although it could involve receipt of a bribe, or failure to register as a foreign agent, if it were in exchange for the performance or expected performance of some official act or a fee for service. Motives and the identity of the donor would matter.Also, 'enemy' is a term of art in the law of war and the law of treason in the United States. Basically, it means someone who is a national of a country which the U.S. is in a declared war. Other than members of some some terrorist groups (including ISIS), and possibly citizens of North Korea, I do not believe that anyone else in the world counts as an 'enemy' at this time for legal purposes.The U.S. Constitution in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 8 does specify that it is improper to receive 'emoluments' from a foreign power. It says:  [N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them [i.e.,  the United States], shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept  of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever,  from any King, Prince, or foreign State.In other words, no federal government official may receive any gift or title from a foreign government or monarch. State Department protocol ratified by Congress mandates that when gift from a foreign government or monarch is received by a U.S. government official because international etiquette requires it, that it be turned over to the United States government to become federal government property as soon as it is reasonably practical to do so without offending the donor, since the purpose is to prevent a government official from personally benefitting from his or her office.I suspect that it is a crime to receive an emolement without turning it over to the U.S. if you are a federal official whether or not an 'enemy' provided it. If I have time I will look up the chapter and verse."}

{"question":"My friend told me about how she got incredible discounts on hotels and airfare because she registered as a travel agent (Utah\/USA) and many places offer high discounts to agents.  She obtained her license by working through another agent in her neighborhood.

I couldn't find any sources online that said one way or another whether it is fraudulent behavior.    Are there any referencable sources I can point her to that could be helpful?  Or is what is she doing entirely legal?Also, unfortunately, I don't know any more details about her license or method of obtaining it as we spoke in casual passing about it.  I can probably ask her though, if necessary.","answer":"The  does not issue licenses for travel agents, and there seems to be no evidence of a statutory requirement for licensing. Therefore it's unclear what status this license has. I did see a number of online places offering to train people to be travel agents, and perhaps one of them offers a certificate of training.There is such a thing as an IATA number, and some hotel might require providing one's IATA number. If a person does not have an IATA number and the hotel does not verify the IATA number, then it would be fraud to falsely make up a number in order to obtain a benefit. The person could be sued to recover the amount of the discount. If the person has an IATA number, then there nothing obviously fraudulent, but you would have to inspect the conditions for using an agent discount. requires you to work at a registered agency to get an agent number, and the proof requirements are substantial enough that it would be surprising if a person could get away with just claiming to work at a travel agency. The organization would certainly be in a good position to sue a person for falsifying the application (note also that the application is subject to binding arbitration by the Travel Agency Commissioner).So it depends on who gave the discount, what the required, what if any accreditation was used to get that discount, and what the actual facts are (i.e. does the person actually work for an agency making at least $10,000 a year)."}
{"question":"Obviously this question was inspired by recent events in the United States, specifically the state of Georgia.   It applies more generally though to any such case.   I thought that in order to be a juror in a case, you couldn't have a personal interest in the case as that would be a conflict.Example:  Company A is suing Company B,   I own a bunch of stock in Company A,  I would have an obvious personal bias as to who wins the case.Since state level crimes are prosecuted in the state they happen and potential jurors are eligible voters,   would this make it impossible for anyone who voted in the election to serve on such a jury as they would obviously prefer their side to win?   You couldn't have a change of venue as it is a state level crime and everyone in the state is involved.So, would they have to find a jury of 12 nonvoters,  or would they ignore this and just ask if jury members would swear to put aside their personal feelings about who should win?","answer":"Since state level crimes are prosecuted in the state they happen and potential jurors are eligible voters, would this make it impossible for anyone who voted in the election to serve on such a jury as they would obviously prefer their side to win?No.A conflict of interest is a particularized and personal interest in the case that is different from an interest of a member of the general public or of a voter or of a taxpayer in general.

{"question":" that makes its UI look like Windows 10. It copies the desktop background, Windows logo Start menu icon, and the overall look and feel of the UI. The purpose is to allow ethical hackers\/penetration testers to use Kali Linux in public places (e.g. a client's office) without drawing attention from bystanders who might not know that the testing is authorized. (The default Kali UI and [especially] desktop background are quite distinctive, and would likely look somewhat suspicious even to someone who doesn't know about Kali. Someone who does know about it would almost certainly be concerned to see someone using it at their workplace.) Assuming Offensive Security (the company that develops Kali Linux) didn't get permission from Microsoft, is this legal? I doubt Microsoft would give a license for an intentionally deceptive clone of Windows's UI.","answer":"Copyright would generally protect all aspects of the Windows operating system. Therefore, to the extend that Kali is visually similar to Windows, it might be illegal infringement. It would not be infringement if those elements were used with permission from MS (note that the product is available on the Microsoft store). Since you semi-stipulate that they do not have permission, we can move to the possibility of a fair use defense. That defense might be successful since at least apparently there would be no effect on market and the copying is somewhat transformative.Finally, the finder of fact would have to decide if those elements of Kali are substantially similar to the Windows originals. It could be found that the similarity which you perceive is due to copying the idea, not copying the expression. E.g. the idea of a manila folder as an icon is not protected, so it becomes a fairly technical discussion centering oncopyright law and look and feel."}
{"question":"An  claims that in general, any lectures, slides, textbooks, or scholarly articles you [as faculty] write belong to you and not your school, and this is true regardless of whether the school posts a policy on its web site claiming otherwise, and even regardless of whether they get you to sign a contract stating otherwise.and cites Weinstein v. University of Illinois and Hays v. Sony Corp in support of this statement. However, it seems to me that  explicitly considers university IP policy in making the determination of whether the scholarly work under consideration was 'work for hire'. First it saysThe statute is general enough to make every academic article a 'work for hire' and therefore vest exclusive control in universities rather than scholars. See DuBoff, An Academic's Copyright: Publish and Perish, 32 J. Copyright Society 17 (1984). The University of Illinois, like many other academic institutions, responded to the 1978 revision of the copyright laws by adopting a policy defining 'work for hire' for purposes of its employees, including its professors.then it quotes the university policy on work for hire, and then it makes a determination based on whether the university IP policy on work for hire can be interpreted to apply to the particular work under consideration:The University's copyright policy [on work for hire] reads more naturally when applied to administrative duties. Perhaps the University forms a committee to study the appropriate use of small computers and conscripts professors as members. The committee may publish a report, in which the University will claim copyright. We do not say that a broader reading is impossible, but such a reading should be established by evidence about the deliberations underlying the policy and the course of practiceFurthermore, the more recent  refers to a directive in Weinstein, to look for evidence of intent from the history and deliberations that occurred in implementing the University's policy. Thus it is not clear to me whether the so-called 'teacher exception' to work for hire applies if the university's intellectual property policy or contract asserts ownership of copyright of course materials.","answer":"The leading case in this area is  490 U.S. 730 (1989).<sup>1<\/sup>There are two routes to employers automatically being the first owner of copyright in a work produced by a hired party: in an employee-employer relationship, or in certain works by independent contractors if an express agreement is made.CCNV construed the definition of 'work made for hire' in 17 USC 101 to split paid work into two categories: work done by 'employees' and work done by 'independent contractors'. Copyright in 'employees' are automatically owned by the employer. Copyright in work by independent contractors can also be owned by the employer if it falls under a set of specific categories of work (which course materials are certainly included in) and 'parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire'.The term 'employee' above takes on a special meaning in this context. The court held that the test is to use common law agency principles:  To determine whether a work is a 'work made for hire' within the \u00a7 101 definition, a court should first apply general common law of agency principles to ascertain whether the work was prepared by an employee or an independent contractorThe court listed 12 (non-exhaustive) factors to be taken into account when deciding whether a hired party is a an employee under common law agency and thus the work would be automatically considered a 'work for hire':the hiring party's right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplishedthe skill requiredthe source of the instrumentalities and toolsthe location of the workthe duration of the relationship between the partieswhether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired partythe extent of the hired party's discretion over when and how long to workthe method of paymentthe hired party's role in hiring and paying assistantswhether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring partywhether the hiring party is in businessthe provision of employee benefitsthe tax treatment of the hired partyThis is a case-by-case judgement, and courts have not made a ruling that applies to all university course materials universally. I'm sure we could all imagine arrangements that would fall squarely on the 'employee' side of the test, and thus give the employer first ownership of copyright in course material just as easily as we could imagine arrangements that would fall squarely on 'independent-contractor' side.There are arguments on both sides regarding whether the typical university professor or lecturer relationship would be considered an 'employee' relationship for the purpose of the 'work made for hire' definition (I'll come back to reference some law journal articles later).Regardless, even if particular relationship is found to be an 'independent-contractor', the employer can still be the first owner of copyright in the works if 'parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire' (assuming the work is one of the categories listed in the 17 USC 101 definition of 'work made for hire' part (2), and course material certainly is).Last, even for independently contracted work that doesn't fall under one of the special categories in 'work made for hire' (2), parties could agree to a contract requiring assignment of copyright. In this case, the employer wouldn't be the initial owner, but they would be due equitable assignment of the copyright by the author.<sup>1. There are various reasons why Weinstein (mentioned in the question) is not relevant. Weinstein doesn't hold that the author of course material is automatically the copyright owner. Weinstein is pre-CCNV. Weinstein was a Seventh Circuit opinion; CCNV is a Supreme Court opinion. The test that was being used at the time by the Seventh Circuit (an 'actual control of the work' test) was rejected by the Supreme Court in CCNV.<\/sup>"}

There is no specific minimum distance from the aircraft and the ground, but the operator must fly the thing safely, and not above people.And finally, apart from the criminal aspects of shooting a drone out of the sky, you can also be sued for property damage, and is thus illegal.That said, in light of , this does not mean you will get anywhere if you sue the gunner for blasting your plane, at least if your venue is the western district federal court in Kentucky. You can sue in state court for trespass to chattels, and the FCC could (but did not) seek an action against the offender for blasting a plane out of the sky, but there is a narrow path for suing in federal court. The district court found that the plane-owner stepped off the path (the case was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction).

{"question":"Brady Rule Primary tabs The Brady Rule, named after Brady v. Maryland,373 U.S. 83 (1963), requires prosecutors to disclose materiallyexculpatory evidence in the government's possession to the defense. A\"Brady material\" or evidence the prosecutor is required to discloseunder this rule includes any evidence favorable to theaccused--evidence that goes towards negating a defendant's guilt, thatwould reduce a defendant's potential sentence, or evidence going tothe credibility of a witness.In regards to the issue of a credibility check of a witness. I f the government withholds information that is pertinent to the credibility of a witness is that cause for a mistrial? Does whether the government knowingly or unknowingly withheld this information influence whether a mistrial will be granted?","answer":"If the government withholds information that is pertinent to thecredibility of a witness is that cause for a mistrial?Only if the error is not harmless under the standard applicable to evaluating harmless error in criminal cases (there is a voluminous case law on that point). Basically, it means that a new trial may be held and a conviction vacated on a charge against a particular defendant if there is a reasonable possibility that the withheld evidence, when considered in light of the total picture of evidence presented at trial, might have changed the outcome on guilt or innocence.Does whether the government knowingly or unknowingly withheld thisinformation influence whether a mistrial will be granted?Not really. Knowledge is imputed. If someone in the prosecution team including the police knows, then it is known to the entire team for Brady purposes.If no one knew that it had the information (e.g. a key exculpatory document in possession of the prosecution was misfiled in one of dozens of bankers boxes of documents that it seized in a search and no one reviewed those particular boxes knowing to look for a document like that one or attuned to its potential significance, since it wasn't supposed to be in the place where it was filed), then it hasn't been withheld in the Brady sense unless someone specifically asked for the information in question with enough specificity that it could have been located if they looked at what they already had.The knowledge that must be disclosed is what the . So, if a beat cop hides exculpatory evidence from the prosecutor's office, that is a Brady violation, but if the cops do a sloppy investigation that fails to reveal exculpatory evidence that is out there to be found, it isn't a Brady violation. Likewise, if a cop in another department halfway across the state knows something that impacts the credibility of a witness and the prosecutor is totally unaware of the existence of that information as are all the cops working on the case, then that isn't a Brady violation.What If It Isn't A Brady Violation?Exculpatory evidence discovered after the trial that isn't a Brady violation not to disclose may still be grounds for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence in a motion for post-trial relief.But, the standard to get the court to grant a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence that was not withheld in a Brady violation is much more stringent than the mere harmless error standard. :With a single exception, criminal defendants in the United Statesseeking a new trial based on newly discovered evidence are required toestablish only that the new evidence makes it more likely than notthat, in a new trial, they would be acquitted.Ohio requires clear and convincing evidence rather than a mere preponderance.There's a lot of case law on what constitutes newly discovered evidence which is new, material evidence that was unavailable at the time of the original trial[.] If evidence was available, but not used at trial, it can't be presented in a motion for new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. Often this means that it can't be considered even if the salience of the evidence previously available is only clear later in the light of other evidence that is genuinely newly discovered, or the defense attorney's failure to use that evidence in the first trial was negligent to a level constituting legal malpractice."}
{"question":"I got an offer from a company(US Based) that seems like a wonderful opportunity.

Pro-rated means that you will only be paid the portion of your annual salary that was earned as of your termination.The real kicker is the final sentence which means you don't get paid for unused sick or vacation days (not that unusual), or bonuses not finally approved (again not that unusual), or expense reimbursements not yet submitted for payment (unusual and really potentially quite unfair).Moral of story: Don't run up too many unreimbursed expenses and get the ones you have submitted ASAP."}
{"question":"My city regulates fences to be no more than 6' in height. In many cases, the fence as a support for growing tall hedges that could exceed this height. I can't find a definition of a fence in my city codes - is it reasonable take the common definition of what a fence is and assume that a hedge won't be considered a fence for the purposes of height limitation?","answer":"It seems reasonable, but it may not be safe. If your city treats such fence-line hedges as part of the fence, and subject to the height restriction, whether under some provision of the city code that you did not find, or under a practice interpreting the code, they might enforcdce the hight limit on you. I don't know what this might involve: A fine, or a requirement that you remove the fence, or just cut it down to size, or what. If I were in that position, I would try to ask the city - the city clerk, the public works department, or whoever is in charge of enforcing the height restriction.

{"question":"While reading over a lease agreement I saw this: At the request of the Landlord, the Tenant shall sign a letter stating that the Landlord has fully performed all of the Landlord's agreements in this lease.

As a potential tenant, is there legal justification for my concern in signing this?","answer":"I see no problems with this - it cannot force you to tell lies. A letter stating '... except for ...' would fully discharge the tenant's obligation.This clause can only be sensibly interpreted (and would be so by a court) by reading in the words '... if they have done so' at the end.

{"question":"Given that a Minnesota policewoman used a firearm, when she verbally indicated she would Taser a fleeing suspect.  Assume there is no malice or racism component to the shooting and that she thought she had the non-lethal taser, when in fact she had a lethal firearm.What is the range of charges she would face? What if any defense does qualified immunity provide in a case of such a serious error?","answer":"Federal Civil Rights LiabilityQualified immunity is a doctrine that applies to lawsuits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking compensation for an intentional violation of constitutional rights under color of state law.The qualified immunity inquiry is not reached in the first place if the prima facie case is not established because the conduct allegedly violating a constitutional right under color of state law, even if it is a well established constitutional right (i.e. one memorialized in a reported and controlling appellate court decision that is factually similar), if the action was merely negligent rather than intentional.Thus, most likely, there is no federal civil remedy to the victim, unless even the use of the taser would have been a violation of a well established constitutional right under color of state law. Non-deadly force, like a taser, is subject to a lower threshold of justification than deadly force, like a firearm.Of course, under general Fourth Amendment principles applicable to the states, an attempted arrest which appears to be what the OP describes, must be supported by probable cause that a crime was committed for which an arrest would be authorized. So, if this is the violation of rights alleged, there may be a federal civil rights remedy. But, further examination of the facts show that there was apparently a warrant for the arrest of the person shot outstanding. So the officer probably has a legal basis to use non-deadly force to make an arrest pursuant to the outstanding warrant, but probably did not have a legal basis to use deadly force to make an arrest.Federal Criminal LiabilityThe most common charge under federal criminal law for excessive use of force by a police officer, is a criminal violation of civil rights. But this, like the civil remedy, requires a showing of an intentional violation of civil rights which the OP tends to suggest is absent unless the officer lacked probable cause to make an arrest.State Law Civil LiabilityAt the state level, law enforcement officers acting under color of state law are immune from civil liability except as authorized by state law in an exception to sovereign immunity. Generally, there is no exception to sovereign immunity for a negligent use of force by a police officer.So, the police officer probably can't be sued successfully by the victim's estate under state law.State Criminal Law ConsiderationsFor criminal law purposes, whether or not the law enforcement officer's actions were a crime under state law would dependent upon both the elements of the offense: probably manslaughter or negligent homicide in this case, and the scope of force authorized under state law in the case of a law enforcement officer seeking to arrest a fleeing suspect.Usually, under state law, the use of reasonable force to make an arrest supported by probable cause is allowed and the use of deadly force to make an arrest support by probable cause is allowed only if there is a threat to the public based upon probable cause to believe that a particularly serious violent felony was committed.Qualified immunity is not applicable to state criminal law liability, although express statutory defenses in a state criminal statute might be similar in some cases.CaveatOf course, all of that analysis assumes that the story of the officer's motive and intentions was truthful. There is very good reason to be skeptical of this fact and to believe that the use of a firearm was not a negligent mistake, and that race was a motivating factor. Simply saying that one's motives were good is not a free pass and a jury doesn't have to believe the law enforcement officer."}

Is there anything special I have to do to link the website to my LLC, so it's a 'product' of the LLC?","answer":"An LLC isn't a magical way of avoiding legal liability. If someone enters into a contract solely with your LLC, then you might be able to avoid liability under the contract  which is why banks invariably require loans to LLCs to be personally guaranteed. But if you commit a tort or crime as part of your LLC's business, you're still on the hook.Max Kennerly, a US trial lawyer, explains this in a blog post:  He cites the following passage from Restatement of the Law, Third, Agency \u00a7 7.01:  An agent is subject to liability to a third party harmed by the agents tortious conduct.

Since you mention a (previous) contract, I assume that means that she was bound to pay for service for a certain period of time or pay a cancellation fee for early termination. That strikes me as sufficiently unusual that it might actually be illegal (power being a highly regulated industry), depending on state. Assuming there is some such fee, or at least the hassle of cancelling the service, then she would be getting something of value. The other side would also get something of value to them (avoidance of hassle, service interruption, possible credit check issues). So you have 'consideration', an essential element of a contract (which the other side breached).What she presumably has to do is 'not cancel the service', and what they have to do is 'pay the bill'. She apparently did what she was supposed to do, and they didn't: a breach of contract. She was harmed substantially (there may be some problem quantifying the damage to credit rating, even if they eventually paid the bill). Were it not for the matter of compensating her for damage to credit score, this should be a simple enough Judge Judy type matter where she sues the other party in small claims court. Let us assume that the understanding was informal, i.e. there is no written contract. That doesn't matter, what matters is that each side understands what they are getting and what they have to do. It is simply not credible for the other side to say 'Well, we thought that she was just paying out electric bill because of her deep and abiding affection for us'. So even if they deny there having been such an agreement, they acted as though there were such an agreement (they did not get the account changed so that they would be responsible). It would probably be mandatory to consult an attorney to decide how and whether to sue.There is some possibility that the arrangement would not be considered to be a binding agreement, that is, the parties had no intention to be legally bound, within a family. That doctrine is more prominent in England than in the US, and there certainly isn't any doctrine here that there are no binding contracts between family members (I can find no case like ) family members can be held to the terms of a contract. Whether or not such an argument would gain traction in court would depend on objective facts, reducing to the question 'do the facts indicate that this was a gift?'. Such an argument might be more credible for an ostensive agreement that was made in the course of an amicable family relationship, but is not very credible in the event of a divorce or other break-up.

{"question":"our organization is registered in the United States. By registering the company in the US means, are we under the jurisdiction of the FTC? or is it something else? because we are planning to get the privacy shield certification. For that, it is mandatory to be subjected to the jurisdiction of FTC, but I don't know how to find our company's status. I am not familiar with US laws and regulations since I am new to this area.","answer":"The US  is responsible for the enforcement of certain US laws, particularly in the areas of anti-trust (monopolistic practices) and consumer protection.The FTC itself, on its page  says:The Federal Trade Commission enforces a variety of antitrust and consumer protection laws affecting virtually every area of commerce, with some exceptions concerning banks, insurance companies, non-profits, transportation and communications common carriers, air carriers, and some other entities. The agency leverages its resources and targets its enforcement efforts at practices that cause the greatest harm to consumers.The basic statute enforced by the FTC, Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, empowers the agency to investigate and prevent unfair methods of competition, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce. This creates the Agencys two primary missions: protecting competition and protecting consumers. The statute gives the FTC authority to seek relief for consumers, including injunctions and restitution, and in some instances to seek civil penalties from wrongdoers. The FTC has the ability to implement trade regulation rules defining with specificity acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive and the Commission can publish reports and make legislative recommendations to Congress about issues affecting the economy. The Commission enforces various antitrust laws under Section 5(a) of the FTC Act as well as the Clayton Act. The FTC monitors all its orders to ensure compliance.Any organization or business that operates within the United States in fields covered by any FTC order is subject to its jurisdiction, whether it is registered or not. Businesses that deal with consumers will find a number of FTC regulations applying to their operations. Businesses that operate on a business-to-business basis, but do not have anything close to monopoly control of any industry will be less impacted.The FTC does oversee some Federal privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).In short, it is what an organization does that makes it subject to various FTC regulations. Without knowing what an organization does, there is no way to know to what extent it will come under FTC regulations.The  was declared invalid by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 16 July 2020 on the grounds it did not provide adequate protections to EU citizens on government snooping.

{"question":"Hello I am trying to learn more about securities and really confused by the laws regarding unregistered securities in the US. NJ state if that helps too. I made a scenario and I am needing help to understand if this would be legal or not.In online poker you play poker and when you win the tournament against other players then are granted a entry ticket into the next event. As you may know you can win money in poker.I am having trouble understanding the Howey Test which is \"investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.\" Which is used to deem what is and isn't a security.Here's my thought experiment from my thinking into this concept:If you were to play a poker tournament, win it and be issued a ticket that gave you access to a percentage of all the money paid into the NEXT tournament by other players (let's call it a \"money ticket\") as a prize would this \"money ticket\" be a security? Why\/why not?The \"money ticket\" would basically be a revenue share voucher.Edit: What if you only got the profits if you won the second tournament as well? Would the ticket still be a security?Thank you!","answer":"<h4>Almost certainly yes.<\/h4>As you say, the test is indeed the , which, as you say, asks if it is an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.Here, the efforts of others would be running the poker tournament.  The expectation of profits is to be derived from the proceeds of their efforts running the tournament, advertising it, etc.  It's basically pretty similar to receiving something like equity in the tournament, and equity is of course well-established to be a security.To avoid running afoul of laws against unregistered security offerings, they would likely need to either limit the people who could win such a ticket to  or go to the trouble of formally registering the securities.  The latter isn't impossible: banks routinely register a wide variety of securities that they sell to their various customers.  But it is a lot more process, and banks who do this are set up to be able to do it with as little process overhead as possible.  Whether that would be practical for a company running poker tournaments would probably depend a lot on the details of the situation."}
{"question":"In the United States, which laws would spying on someone using their computer's webcam, without their permission and in private areas, break?","answer":"A creative prosecutor could probably come up with a raft of charges. But you could start with the federal wiretapping statute, 18 USC 2511, and the anti-hacking statute, 18 USC 1030.  is an indictment brought in 2012 under the anti-hacking statute against someone who distributed and used this kind of software.Depending on the facts and the jurisdiction, this may also constitute the tort of intrusion on privacy or seclusion, a tort recognized by the Restatement (Second) and actionable in many jurisdictions. The most common test is whether the invasion would be 'offensive to a reasonable person.'And no, contrary to the commenter's view, a 'click to accept' license is not a get out of (literal) jail free card here. Courts interpret adhesion contracts liberally to favor the signer, and outrageous terms hidden in small print are not guaranteed to be enforceable, especially if the software is clearly designed to trick people into installing it. The license terms might even hurt you, by providing evidence of your intent to use the software for perving rather than its ostensible use.This is not an exhaustive list, and there may be additional state-level statutes that apply. Bottom line: yes, this is clearly illegal, and the courts will be reluctant to let you trick people into getting away with it."}
{"question":"Can a private company challenge an allegation made by the government and sue for damage? Let's say that you own a chocolate factory in Cuba, but you were blacklisted for allegation of using slave labor by the DOJ or DOC or the U.S. military, can you go to the U.S. and challenge the allegation in an U.S. court?","answer":"One approach would be to sue the government for defamation. , there is a limit on the causes of action which is more stringent than ordinary liability. In particular, you can sue forAny other civil action or claim against the United States, notexceeding $10,000 in amount, founded either upon the Constitution, orany Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department, orupon any express or implied contract with the United States, or forliquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort,except that the district courts shall not have jurisdiction of anycivil action or claim against the United States founded upon anyexpress or implied contract with the United States or for liquidatedor unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort which aresubject to sections 7104(b)(1) and 7107(a)(1) of title 41.Or, in short, if the government does something illegal. There is no federal defamation statute (regulation etc) so it's not against the law in this specific sense for the government to defame you. And that assumes that there was a defamatory claim.Whatever you mean by blacklisting, it has to reduce to some restriction on commercial transactions under some regulation, such as the sanctions against Iran. Such restrictions are authorized by Congress, and generally involve a presidential order pursuant to a federal determination of unlawful behavior by parties over there. For example, Huawei has been blacklisted, but not all goods from China are blacklisted. Here are the . Since this is a fairly broad and hypothetical question, let's assume that a company is on a list because of X, but X is not actually true. Then putting the company on the list is not legal (the statutory conditions are not satisfied), and the company can sue the government. But hire a really good attorney, because the underlying authority may involve sole determination or at the discretion of the President.Products produced with forced labor (even in part) , but basically there may be an investigation into an allegation of forced  labor. AAnd then(f) If it is determined on the basis of the foregoing that themerchandise is subject to the provisions of the said section 307, theCommissioner of CBP, with the approval of the Secretary of theTreasury, will publish a finding to that effect in a weekly issue ofthe Customs Bulletin and in the Federal Register.(g) Any merchandise of a class specified in a finding made underparagraph (f) of this section, which is imported directly orindirectly from the locality specified in the findings and has notbeen released from CBP custody before the date of publication of suchfinding in the Federal Register shall be considered and treated as animportation prohibited by section 307, Tariff Act of 1930, unless theimporter establishes by satisfactory evidence that the merchandise wasnot mined, produced, or manufactured in any part with the use of aclass of labor specified in the finding.You might sue under the theory that required procedure wasn't followed; you might even sue under the theory that no reasonable finder of fact could think that the goods were the product of forced labor. However, the courts generally defer to the judgment of regulatory agencies, so you will probably lose that lawsuit. But also, you would not be suing over the allegation, you would be suing over the restriction. The government can allege away to its best judgment, however bad that may be."}
{"question":"In something like this:'We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place.' Brown v. Bd. of Educ.,  347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954)'.What is that cryptic thing after the quotation marks? How do I understand what it says? Is there somewhere I can go to read these cases, or read about them?","answer":"The author of the passage is telling you where the quotation comes from, using a formal case citation. Lawyers usually don't use footnotes, endnotes, or parentheses to set off these citations.Case citations are a sort of shorthand developed by lawyers and judges over the past few centuries. The goal is generally to identify the name of the case, where to locate it, when it was decided, and what court decided it. Although there are a few different styles for formal citations to cases, you don't need to learn much to cover the basics for common types of cases.How to Read ItCase name  Brown v. Bd. of Educ.Case names usually have a 'v.' in the middle. Most of the time, the plaintiff goes on the left and the defendant goes on the right. But United States Supreme Court cases are different. Almost always, the Supreme Court reviews decisions of lower courts. They do so in an unusual way: the loser in the lower court asks the Supreme Court to change the outcome. Because the loser, more formally called the 'appellant,' is the one initiating proceedings in the Supreme Court, they go on the left. (To learn more, look into 'writ of certiorari.') Since Brown is a Supreme Court case, we can guess that Brown lost in the lower court; and indeed that's what happened in this case.There are some arcane rules about abbreviating case names. The full name of this case is 'Brown et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka.' If you're a law student, especially if you're on the law review, you get to learn all about these rules. If you're not, thank your lucky stars and try not to worry about it.Volume, reporter, and page number  347 U.S. 483This is the bit you want to copy and paste to find the case. It's a lot like a URL: the idea is to clearly identify and locate a case. If you just want to find the case on the Internet, you don't need to understand how it works, and you can skip to the next section. These three parts tell you where to find the beginning of the case in a good old-fashioned printed book. You know those yellow books in the background of lawyer advertisements? That's what we're talking about. They're called 'reporters,' because they originally contained somebody else's reports of what judges said in court. Now, of course, the judges write down their own decisions; but the name stuck.The middle part, here 'U.S.', identifies what set of books the case is in. You can learn something about the court from this:<pre>U.S.           -- United States Reports -- United States Supreme CourtF., F.2d, F.3d -- Federal Reporter      -- Federal Courts of AppealF. Supp        -- Federal Supplement    -- Federal District Courts (trial courts)<\/pre>The first number is what volume  the case is in. This is the number printed on the spine of the book. The second number is what page the case begins on.Pinpoint citation  , 495When somebody wants to refer to a specific place in a case, they just put the page number or range right after the case page number. Remember, '483' was the page the case starts on; '495' is the page where the court actually say what we're talking about. If you flip to page 495 of volume 347 of the U.S. Reports, you'll find the quoted sentence.Remember: usually when you see two numbers separated by a comma, like '483, 495', the first one is part of the citation to the case as a whole, and the second one says what page to look at.Date and court name  (1954)This part varies a lot between the different formal styles. In 'Bluebook' style, which most law journals use, the year the case was decided is enclosed in parentheses, along with anything necessary to identify the court. Here, there's no court name, because we already know from the 'U.S.' that it's a Supreme Court case. For lower appellate cases, this might be '(9th Cir. 2005)', meaning that it's a decision of the  from 2005.Dealing with short citationsYou may also see something like 'Id. at 495'. This is a short citation; 'Id.' means 'the last thing I cited.' Go back to the nearest previous citation and look that up, going to the page cited.How to Use It (aka 'tl;dr')The key to actually finding a case on the Internet is to copy the three numbers in the middle--the volume, reporter name, and page number. Here, '347 U.S. 483'. Don't include any pincite after a comma; Google and many search engines may be clever enough to figure out what you mean, but they may not.There are a bunch of free online services providing case texts. I prefer ; just paste the citation in, being sure to select 'case law'. Other people like CourtListener, FindLaw, and Justia.com. Commercial databases like Westlaw or LexisNexis have a lot more than just the case; most importantly, they list citations to the case. Your local public law library might have a terminal for one of the services that you can walk in and use.Be sure you're reading the actual case, not a summary or 'annotation.' This is especially true if you're writing an answer here on Law.SE. Many case summaries, especially for famous cases, are written for first-year law students; some of them are probably written by first-year law students! They're often helpful, but they focus on what the student needs to know for class, which often isn't what the case actually said. If I find you quoting a case summary as if it's 'the law,' I will not be very nice to you."}
{"question":"For the sake of argument, let's say that in the 2020 elections Trump lost these 19 \"Much more republican\" states (according to this ) that he had easily won in 2016:According to an excerpt of  and Tuesday's debate, it's very clear that Trump has been recently pushing to discredit the election:President Trumps angry insistence in the last minutes of Tuesdays debate that there was no way the presidential election could be conducted without fraud amounted to an extraordinary declaration by a sitting American president that he would try to throw any outcome into the courts, Congress or the streets if he was not re-elected.This is an assumption, but Trump being Trump, he will not only try to discredit the elections of all these states but he will also want to win by a huge margin (he said he wanted to win 9-0 if it went to the Supreme Court).My question: what process would he need to go through to discredit the votes of the 19 \"Much more republican\" states that he had won in 2016 but lost in 2020?In this , a user mentioned that he needs to file a lawsuit in \"state or federal court with jurisdiction over the state in which an irregularity was alleged\".  Would this be his first step of would another \"entity\" need to verify that his complaint merits a lawsuit?For example, at the debate he said he found ballots in a river. Can he file a state-level lawsuit saying that there's fraud or a miscount because someone found ballots in a river? He also said that he would send his followers to the voting booths, and one of these guys says that he \"saw\" fraud taking place. Is that enough for a lawsuit?And how long would all of this take? Trump being Trump, I assume he'll try to drag out as long as humanly possible.","answer":"IANAL, however I would have to believe that a sitting president could file lawsuits at both the federal and state levels in his capacity as a citizen. I can not find any ruling that would prohibit a citizen from filing and pursuing a lawsuit in Federal or State Courts.

Forcing a private entity to host views that they do not want to violates their first amendment rights.If Facebook or Twitter are fined, they can ignore it, have it taken to the supreme court, and win.Second, Florida cannot prevent Facebook from operating there and do not want a situation where that happens.

{"question":"I know this is a confusing matter and there's been number of questions here and articles elsewhere, but maybe it would be simpler in the situation explained below.Assume there's a non-US company selling software on App Store and providing certain subscription services. The following information has to be provided to Apple:Do you have any U.S. Business Activities?(if Yes for 1.) Are you required to file a US income tax return with respect to the payments you receive from Apple? Assume the following:The company is located in a country that has a tax treaty with US. The company does NOT receive any income other than from Apple. The company does NOT have any employees, contractors or any other personnel, office or any physical assets in US. The only thing US-based that the company DOES have are cloud servers physically located in US provided by a US cloud company, used in order to provide subscription services mentioned above. The location of these servers is not critical for the business, chosen for latency reasons and can be changed for the same or other reasons at any moment later.Based on this, how should the questions above answered?Furthermore, what exactly having or not having 'effectively connected income' would change in this situation, what's more beneficial? Is there a 'if in double choose ...' option?","answer":"This is probably not a 'real' answer (and may be too late), but - here we are, it's almost 2019 and we don't know how to treat transactions of the type you describe.You can do a few things, though, just to clarify your position to yourself:Apple (I'm not familiar with their policies): if you answer that the company does not have any US business activities, do they ask the company to file IRS Form W8-Ben-E? If he company doesn't file, will Apple withhold tax on their payments to the company? Check (or better yet, have a US tax lawyer check) the tax treaty which may apply to the company (even that question isn't always as intuitive as you might think), and see if the combination of using Apple and the US cloud host constitutes a 'permanent establishment' under the relevant Article of the relevant treaty. It's not likely the lawyer will have an answer, but if the treaty is new enough, it's just possible. While you are paying that lawyer to look into the problem, ask him or her to determine if your company is treated (for US tax and treaty purposes - two different things, possibly) as a corporation or a flow-through entity; the answer may make a significant difference to the outcome.Finally, check with a tax lawyer in your (or your company's - not necessarily the same) home country to see if US taxes withheld from payments to your company (or paid by your company if it files US tax returns) are creditable (in full) against home country taxes (if any). If so, the impact may be minimized.If it's any consolation, you are on the cutting edge of 21st century international taxation :)"}

They don't have to ask, and they don't have to independently verify implications (e.g. if the third party says 'our apartment', they don't have to ask 'does that mean that you live here?').

On the other hand, immigration is a matter of federal law.The responsibilities of local or state police are governed by state law, and the federal government cannot compel state officers to enforce federal law. A specific state's law could potentially require state and local police to ask about people's immigration status and\/or ask the federal government to check on the status of someone they suspect might be illegal. I believe a few red states have enacted, or are considering, such laws, though they usually deal with people stopped by police rather than people filing a report.

My question is after President Trump leaves office, can a new president overrule the pardon?My understanding is if the pardon is issued during a the trial the trial would be halted. If the pardon was later overruled the individual would need to be tried again, but double jeopardy would probably get in the way. This might also extend to if the pardon is issued after the charges were filed but prior to the trial. Double jeopardy may also prevent overruling a pardon after a conviction since it would require a new conviction to punish the individual.In the case of pardoning an individual prior to charges being filed (and possibly prior to the crimes being committed) can a later president overrule the earlier president and hence allow a trial to take place?","answer":"The US Constitution Article II, Section 2 grants sayt that the President 'shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment'. It does not anywhere say that a pardon can be rescinded. Until a constitutional amendment is added giving the president the power to rescind a pardon (zero chance of that happening), a pardon is permanent.For reference, , 267 U.S. 87 addresses the question of limiting the presidential pardon power, where the losing side argued that criminal contempt is not an 'offense against the United States', and the Supreme Court held that criminal contempt is such an offense. Nothing has legally changed since then."}
{"question":"Can you sue someone for parodying your character? Or is this part of free speech? One thing I am always wondering is why people won't use \"Google\" in movies, especially cartoons, but parody real people like Donald Trump. It's like you can't hurt the brand of a company, but you can hurt the brand of a person. What does the law say on this in the United States?","answer":"DefinitionsA brand name is not a character. Neither is a real person, unless that person is being used as a character in a work of fiction. I will answer what I think the question intends.One can't really parody a real person, but one can use a person fictitiously.I am using  here a narrow definition of parody, that one parodies a work by imitating it so as to comment on it, often but not always negatively. I exclude from parody: cases where the events of a work are imitated to tell a different story, or the same story in a different setting -- that is retelling. (West Side Story is a retelling of Romeo and Juliet, not a parody, in this sense.) I also exclude cases where the form or style of a work is imitated to make a different point, or for general humorous effect.  That would be satire but not parody.I am using this narrow sense of parody because it is my understanding that only parody in the narrow sense has been held to be fair use. Satire or retelling is not generally fair use under US law, at least not because of the satire or retelling.CopyrightThe US Supreme Court has held in , in which it held that  Alice Randall's 2001 parody, The Wind Done Gone, was not an infringement of Gone with the WindBut it is important to note that the definition of parody used in those cases is significantly more limited than the use sometimes made of the term in artistic circles or by average people.The courts held that a parody was fair use specifically because it commented on the original. A reworking of a story which did not particularly comment on the original, such as West Side Story based on Romeo and Juliet  would not be fair use, at least not because it was a reworking\/parody. (Of course Shakespeare is not protected by modern copyright, but if it were, West Side Story might be an infringement.)The use of the name or description of a real person in a work of fiction would not be an infringement of copyright, as no copyright covers a real person.TrademarkUse of a variant of a protected trademark in such a way that reasonable consumers might be confused into thinking that it was created, approved, endorsed or sponsored by the trademark holder would normally be a trademark infringement.On the other hand a trademark may be used to talk about a product, using the trademark as the name of the product. This is known as nominative use.Thus a character in a book or movie could say I bought a Ford or I looked it up on Google and it would not be trademark infringement, usually. However, authors and particularly movie-makers do not want to risk a possibly expensive trademark suit and so they often invent product names to avoid any possible risk of trademark infringement claims. The names of people are less often protected than trademarks, although some are.Some fictional characters have their names or images protected as trademarks, but most do not. Use of the name of a real person could not be trademark infringement, unless that person's name was a protected trademark (rare but it sometimes happens). Even then, use would probably be nominative use unless the public would be likely to be confused into thinking that the person had approved or endorsed the work.DefamationIf a person is used as a character in a work of fiction, and the character is portrayed in a negative way, this might give rise to a claim for defamation.For that claim to hold up, reasonable people would have to think that the description in the work of fiction also applies to the actual person. The work would have to make false factual statements about the person, that harmed the person's reputation.If the suit were in the US, and the person defamed was a public official or a public figure, the plaintiff would have to prove actual malice. That means proof that statements of fact were made knowing that they were false, or with reckless indifference to the truth. Proof of actual malice is often hard to obtain.Note that a work of fiction can be defamatory if a person is readily recognized, even if the name and some details were changed. For example the movie  was clearly based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, and Hearst is said to have considered a defamation action."}
{"question":"It is common in for courts to cite case law.  But why do they cite or note what their citations cite?  Here's an example I just came across:National Business Services, Inc. v.

Pa.1983))The first citation is to a specific page in a 1998 order from a U.S. District Court.  Why parenthetically note how that in turn cites an earlier 1983 order from the same court?  It's not like it lends more authority to the primary citation.  (Or if it does, then why stop at the second layer of citation?  If the 1983 order cited something earlier should it be listed as well?)","answer":"This practice varies depending on the court and\/or judge's own style preferences and is often a judgment call based on what the author is trying to communicate with a citation.I'll give a few reasons why a judgment might provide multiple layers of citations:because the deeper source is a well-used precedent for a particular point, so it is meaningful for readers to know that the shallower source cited the well-accepted leading case on an issueto show that a particular proposition has been long-accepted in a jurisdiction (your example might show that whatever proposition that is being cited has been used in this district over a 25-year period)to show that a decision from a lower-level court is consistent with historical jurisprudence or with higher-level jurisprudence:[12] It is common ground between the parties that reasonableness is the applicable standard of review for the Independent Chairpersons decision. I agree (Perron v Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FC 741 (Perron) at para 45, citing Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 (Vavilov) at para 23; see also Schmit v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 1293 at paras 19-20, and the cases cited therein).Here, the author is trying to say this point is well settled. What is the standard of review for decisions of the Independent Chairperson? It is reasonableness. This was stated in Perron, which itself cited Vavilov, Canada's leading case (since 2019) on how to select the standard of review. It is important to know that Perron relied on Vavilov rather than an obsolete framework for selecting the standard of review.In your particular example, it seems that Albert E. Price, Inc. v. Metzner is or was a leading case in the 3rd Circuit on what constitues irreparable harm when seeking a preliminary injunction in copyright infringment cases (based on my very brief skim of how other judgments tend to use it). By noting that a judgment cited Metzner, this is a form of shorthand that is quite meaningful to practitioners in this area of law."}

{"question":"In medical establishments such as doctors' offices or blood draw facilities I have been presented with a digital signature pad and told to sign one or more times.  Usually the person handing it to me will give an extremely vague notional explanation of what it is that I am signing.  I do not get to see the document nor am I given a copy.  For all I know, I could be signing up for Colombia House.  While I always go along with this, a voice in my head keeps telling me that there's something wrong with this setup.Are these signatures really legally binding?  If I was shown one of these documents under oath, I could honestly say I had no knowledge of what the content was. Can I have 'had the intention' to sign a document without ever seeing it?  I only signed a blank screen with limited or no other context.  Should I be refusing to sign?

{"question":"Say I want to have someone create some artwork for my website. How can I make sure they don't use copyrighted material? Or at least that it won't be my responsibility.Assume a contractor, not someone hired as staff. (unless I'm wrong about this being the safer route). And obviously no intent for IP infringement. (by me, of course. Obviously the contractor knows if he\/she copied someone's work... ) Also, what I'm looking for is a way to avoid any problems to begin with, so just telling me that the contractor would be responsible for any of that, isn't enough.","answer":"Unfortunately, there are no guarantees. There is no way to verify that a piece of art submitted by someone will not be found in court to have infringed on someone's copyright. One reason is that two works can be judged to be similar because they reflect similar themes and ideas of artistic expression, without any actual copying, so you just have to take your chances with a jury. Another is that the contractor might be less than honest, and there's no way to prevent that. A standard approach to infringement matters is to include an indemnification clause in your contract, which means that if the contractor infringes, they have to defend you against the accusation, which will reduce to suing the contractor and hoping to mitigate the damage to you by using his pockets. Hopefully he has money.Professional liability insurance would be a wiser approach (in addition, not instead). Although you would \/ could be sued, the insurance company should take care of the matter for you (though you might have to sue them to force them to do so). One reason why an insurance company might refuse to cover you would be if it has sufficient reason to believe that you violated a term in the policy requiring you to not 'contribute' to the problem. So if you have reason to think that a work is infringing but you ignore that evidence, then you would have negligently contributed to the problem, which could relieve them of their duty to take care of you. That would all get sorted out in a suit against the insurance company (which you want to avoid). It is not enough to declare that there is obviously no intent to infringe: what did you do to show that there is no intent to infringe? This is pretty much where the legal theory stuff ends. If you can figure out a way to match the submitted work against protected candidates (e.g. 'other paintings of George Clooney'), vigorous efforts to weed out infringement would be the first line of defense against an infringement suit."}
{"question":"I was watching a true crime type of TV show, which raised an interesting question (to me) regarding wills and inheritance.

The caregiver was aware of this.After some time, the man decided to change his will because of a disagreement with the caregiver.  The caregiver found out about this, and before the man could actually change the will, she murdered him.

She leaves her residuary estate (i.e., whatever else is left of the estate) to her daughter. If the son kills his mother, then under Maryland law, the son's child will inherit the $100,000; however the son's $50,000 (which is also the indirect inheritance of the grandchild through his father), is not available under Maryland law to either the son, or his child.

{"question":"Myself and several friends are planning on starting a for profit worker-owned cooperative business that will provide landscaping services in Washington state.Washington is one of a few states in the US that have created business structures specifically for worker cooperatives (see ), as opposed to having co-ops form as partnerships, LLCs, or corporations as in most states. However, we would like to start our co-op as an LLC to simplify our taxes and bookkeeping, reduce our startup fees, and to have more flexibility as far as our management structure.Unfortunately, WA cooperative law prohibits people from using the word \"cooperative\" unless they form as a cooperative association under RCW 23.86. The regulations for naming LLCs (in ) state:(5)(a) The name of a limited liability company:(i) Must contain the words \"limited liability company,\" the words \"limited liability\" and abbreviation \"Co.,\" or the abbreviation \"L.L.C.\" or \"LLC\"; and(ii) May not contain any of the following words or phrases: \"Cooperative,\" \"partnership,\" \"corporation,\" \"incorporated,\" or the abbreviations \"Corp.,\" \"Ltd.,\" or \"Inc.,\" or \"LP,\" \"L.P.,\" \"LLP,\" \"L.L.P.,\" \"LLLP,\" \"L.L.L.P,\" or any words or phrases prohibited by any statute of this state.The word \"cooperative\" is specifically prohibited for LLC names.

But I was wondering about the legality of calling ourselves \"XXXX Landscaping Co-op, LLC\", since the word \"co-op\" is not specified in the list of prohibited words or abbreviations?Obviously, this would be a sort of \"loophole\" since the law is designed to force all cooperatives into the structure dictated by the state in RCW 23.86, and forbid other businesses from calling themselves cooperatives. But I was wondering if legally, since the word \"co-op\" is not explicitly prohibited, are we entitled to use that name?If we do have a legal basis for it, how would we approach this matter with the WA Secretary of State's office if they are resistant to the idea?Thanks for your advice!","answer":"The law on the web page is not current: as of the beginning of the year,  (you'll find this under Sec. 9103) 'The name of any association subject to this chapter must comply with part I, Article 3 of this act' and is otherwise unchanged.

What exactly is the nature of this process?Here are two possibilities:I file forms to create Superlative Widgets Inc. as a new legal entity, with myself as its incorporator.  Then, operating as the company's board of directors (?), I approve the company to issue 100,000 shares.  Next, I obtain a , using average numbers and probabilities common in studies on startups, and compute the 'fair market value' per share, whichsayturns out to be $0.25.

I then create a company bank account and deposit $1000 in this account.  Next, operating as the company's board of directors or other custodian, I approve the company to issue 100,000 shares.  Since I am the incorporator of the company, I become its sole shareholder, owning all shares, as an immediate implication of issuing the shares.Oddly, neither of the above seems entirely sensible.  In the first case, it appears that I must fund the corporation with at least $25,000 or pay income taxes on the difference if I buy the shares at a lower price  this conclusion seems absurd given that the company is newborn and contains no actual content.

My wife, probably out of a mix of tiredness and single mindedly getting back to the car accidentally walked into another woman on her way out the door.

So I come here to ask:QuestionWhat actions am I legally allowed to do in response to someone else physically harming my wife like in the hypothetical above?","answer":"This is a matter of state law, so let's look at a particular state:  Massachusetts. My answer below is largely based on the .Short answer:  the most problematic part of using force in the situation you describe is that you have a duty to retreat in the state of Massachusetts.  In other words, you would not be justified in using force in your own defense or your wife's defense unless there was no reasonable way to get away from the assailant.  (The opposite of a duty to retreat state is a stand your ground state;   lists which US states are which.) \/>Long answer: You would be acting in defense of another (p. 17 of the instructions):[A] person may use reasonable force when that is necessary to help another person, if it reasonably appears that the person being aided is in a situation where the law would allow him to act in self-defense himself.In other words, your use of force to defend your wife is acceptable if it reasonably appears to you that your wife is in a situation where she would be justified in using self-defense.  So would she be justified in using non-deadly force in self-defence?To prove that the defendant did not act in self-defense, the Commonwealth must prove one of the following things beyond a reasonable doubt:First, that the defendant did not reasonably believe he (she) was being attacked or immediately about to be attacked, and that his (her) safety was in immediate danger; orSecond, that the defendant did not do everything reasonable in the circumstances to avoid physical combat before resorting to force; orThird, that the defendant used more force to defend himself (herself) than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances.The second point would be the tricky one for your hypothetical case.  In a public space, you have the duty to retreat;  this duty does not apply in your home (the castle doctrine), but it does apply everywhere else.  Here are the model jury instructions for this point of law:A person cannot lawfully act in self-defense unless he or she has exhausted all other reasonable alternatives before resorting to force. A person may use physical force in self-defense only if he (she) could not get out of the situation in some other way that was available and reasonable at the time. The Commonwealth may prove the defendant did not act in self-defense by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant resorted to force without using avenues of escape that were reasonably available and which would not have exposed the defendant to further danger.You may consider any evidence about where the incident took place, whether or not the defendant might have been able to escape by walking away or otherwise getting to safety or by summoning help if that could be done in time, or by holding the attacker at bay if the means were available, or by some other method. You may consider whether the use of force reasonably seemed to be the only means of protection in the circumstances. You may take into account that a person who is attacked may have to decide what to do quickly and while under emotional strain."}

I have noise-cancelling headphones, and for the most part they are life-savior, except this case ?because the neighbor has subwoofer speakers and I literally feel with my feet how the floor (and furniture) shakes because of loud sounds, and it seriously distracts me from my study.I have a lease agreement which says that noise is prohibited after 10pm, but there is no clause that any noise during the day. Can I still submit a formal complaint to my landlord about this neighbor? Or should I just call non-emergency police during each noise incident?","answer":" are the limits in Boston: 50 decibels from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. and 70 decibels at any time. If it is annoying you then it is probably greater than 70 dB, you can buy a sound meter if you want to be sure. The advice is:  Car alarms, loud parties, or loud amps: Call the Boston Police Party Line at 617-343-5500, or contact your local police station."}
{"question":"After the defeat of Nazi Germany the Allies, in particular, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union at Potsdam came to an agreement concerning the military occupation and reconstruction of Germany, its borders and the entire European theatre of war. France was not considered as an occupying power and was not invited to the conference at Potsdam, a posh suburb of Berlin.  It addressed Germany's demilitarisation, reparations, and the prosecution of war criminals.Obviously, Germany was divided into two halves; one under the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union, that is East Germany; and one under the Western influence, Western Germany.Q. Under what aspect of international law could the allies accomplish this division?According to Wikipedia, the agreement was not a peace treaty according to international law and was superseded by the Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany, signed in 1990.","answer":"This might be a better fit for History or Politics SE.International law is a mix of customary law and treaties freely entered by the states. Custom changes. But what happened in that regard might have been acceptable even today because it was temporary.The German government of 1933-1945 had committed wars of aggression and genocide.There was a forcible . In the course of denazification, they created a new government in their respective occupation zones according to their own pattern. Three democratic zones, one communist zone, a special case for Berlin and for the Saarland.The four occupying powers and the two German administrations agreed that this would be temporary. The Soviets and the GDR later tried to become permanent, but they did not formally abrogate the four-powers agreement. The FRG talked about reunification but did not want to start WWIII over it. And after 40 years, this temporary division came to an end.There is also the case of former German territories which fell to the Soviet Union (Kaliningrad\/K?nigsberg) and Poland. Reasonable people in West Germany understood that they wouldn't get those back, but they wanted to preserve the claim as a bargaining chip for the final status settlement. By giving up those territories, they could deflect some war reparation claims."}
{"question":"Sideshow Bob has once again declared his candidacy for President. As a demonstration of his ability to negotiate with foreign powers, Bob wants to negotiate a trade deal with a foreign government, with the mutual understanding that the trade deal cannot take effect unless and until Bob formalizes the trade deal as President (assuming neither the current nor any future President other than Bob wants the trade deal.)Such conduct would appear to violate the text of the Logan Act; however, the sole intent of the Act appears to be to protect the foreign policy interests of the current US government. Since the trade deal would only take place in a hypothetical future US government, the current government's foreign policy interests would theoretically remain unaffected.","answer":"<h3>If I'm the Attorney General, Bob goes on trial.<\/h3>Let's look at the relevant text from the Logan Act.Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, withoutauthority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences orcarries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreigngovernment or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influencethe measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer oragent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with theUnited States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shallbe fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, orboth.I see no mention here of current or future administrations, only the influencing of foreign nations.

{"question":"NASA's ISS live feed is center to an app that I am developing. I am wondering if it is copyright infringement to embed the live stream in my app. I think that it might be ok to use it because according to US copyright law, any US government work is not protected under copyright law. First of all, is this true? Second, because NASA is part of the US government, does that mean that NASA's ISS live stream is owned by the US government, and therefore not protected by copyright law?","answer":"It is true that any work of the US government is not subject to copyright in the United States; it may be subject to copyright abroad (the relevant law excludes US government works from US copyright protection; other countries have their own copyright laws that generally don't explicitly exclude US government works, and so the works may be copyrighted there).A government work is defined as something produced by a government employee in the course of his official duties. It doesn't include everything released by a government agency; for instance, if a contractor makes something and the contract specifies that the government gets the copyright, the work is copyrighted (since it wasn't made by a government employee). If a foreign cosmonaut or astronaut composes and sings an original song in a livestream, then NASA may not have copyright in the livestream but the foreign astronaut would have copyright in the song.That said, , where they say that their stuff normally isn't copyrighted unless otherwise noted.

{"question":"Assume that Alice is getting a quote from an insurance company, but something goes wrong in the company's system while processing her quote. The company logs a defect and assigns it to Bob, one of their software developers. In order to analyze the defect so that he knows how to fix it, Bob retrieves the logs from Alice's quote. While Bob is looking at the logs to find out why the problem occurred, he also writes down Alice's personal information (name, address, social security number, etc.), which he later uses to commit identity theft. Assume that due to the nature of the defect, Bob needed to be able to see the complete log of the quote as it went through the insurance company's system.

How are things different if Bob doesn't work directly for the insurance company, but rather for a separate company that has a contract with them?","answer":"  Is the insurance company at fault for Bob stealing Alice's identity?The company will certainly be required to have security measures - outlined by local, state laws, as well as federal laws - in place to prevent data theft, contracts signed by employees that require they keep data secure, and company insurance for when data leaks or thefts happen.

{"question":"The US House Committee on Appropriations just passed a resolution to grant citizenship to Charlie Gard, a British infant. Of course, the resolution is only part of a much larger bill that would need to be passed into law by Congress\/the President.However, recently there has been a lot of noise from the executive branch of the US Government proclaiming that it has power over immigration granted by the US Constitution, with regard to the various immigration bans the White House has attempted to enact.Considering this, and understanding that immigration policies in a broad sense probably came from Congress in some form (as there is a lot of existing 'immigration law' on the books), does Congress have the authority to grant citizenship to an individual? Can Congress pass a law that applies to a single, specific individual (rather than an office or position held by an individual, such as the Office of the President of the United States)? Is there any precedent for either of these things?","answer":"A law which punishes a specific person  a 'bill of attainder'  is unconstitutional. Private laws, which benefit an individual, are legal. An example is , which says  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law, for  the  purposes   of  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act  (8  U.S.C. 1101  et   seq.),  Sopuruchi  Chukwueke  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been   lawfully  admitted  to,  and  remained  in,  the  United  States,  and  shall be eligible for adjustment of status to that of an alien  lawfully admitted for permanent residence under section 245 of the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act  (8  U.S.C.  1255)  upon  filing   an  application  for such adjustment of status.Nothing prevents such a bill from being made law, where the benefit is a grant of citizenship.

{"question":"I have a friend that I fear will never have her driver's license. Now with the back seat type of fully autonomous cars does she have to be licensed to be able to use one?","answer":"Nobody knows. It will depend on how good self driving cars will be, and what legislation will say. You would have to drive yourself if (a) the self driving car encounters a situation that it doesn't know how to handle, and (b) the self driving car detects a defect that makes it unsafe for it to have control. In both cases, if you don't have a driving license, or if you are drunk, you are stuck. So the legislators will have to decide whether it is acceptable that cars might be stuck from time to time. Depends on how often it happens obviously. Of course, today you can have a flat tire, or run out of fuel, and get stuck, so being stuck is not something unheard of."}
{"question":"My parked car was involved in a hit and run accident outside of my house.  Luckily, one of my neighbors saw the incident happen and the other driver ended up getting caught and cited by the police for it.The driver is a minor, so his father is handling the ordeal.  He is very insistent that we not go through insurance, so he would like to pay me directly for the damage to my vehicle.My question is: what is his likely motivation for wanting to go that route?  Is his motive purely financial (i.e., not have his insurance rates raised) or is there some legal benefit to him paying for my damage out of pocket?I live in the state of North Carolina.","answer":"The most likely reason the other driver doesn't want to go through insurance is to avoid a raise in his premiums. However, there could be more serious consequences, up to and including having his insurance cancelled, for example, if the son was not supposed to be driving the car, or based on the criminal nature of the offense.However, there can be serious consequences to not dealing with insurance. Some (if not all) insurance policies require him to report the accident; by failing to do so, he may risk losing his insurance.More importantly to you, if he does not report a claim to his insurance, his insurance will not pay it. This is important to you, because insurance companies, as a general rule, pay claims. Random people don't always; they ignore you, they move out of state, they go bankrupt. If this is a serious amount of money, you need to talk to a lawyer before you enter into a contract with this person, to make sure that it's enforceable, and that if you don't get paid, you have some recourse."}
{"question":"Several discussions Ive had recently about a series of events have made me wonder about some of the legal issues they raise.  I was fortunate not to be personally involved, and dont need advice on how to proceed.  Im primarily wondering about the legal position some of the people involved were in, and what advice they might have gotten, in order to better understand the decisions they made.(Not Quite) The FactsIve changed the details for this example, and cleaned up some of the ambiguities.  The real world is, as ever, less certain.Alice, Bob, Carol and Della all work for Ethan at the Portland, Oregon branch office of a large company in the middle of the twenty-teens.  Alice is a superstar, could go anywhere, and periodically gets called away on big international projects.  She has a lot of influence, and Ethan couldnt fire her even if he wanted to.  Right now, though, she reports to Bob.  Bob supervises many other people, including Carol and Della, who are fresh out of college.  Unlike Alice, they make almost nothing.  Bob basically has the power to make or break their careers.Bob is smart enough to know not to mess with Alice.  But Carol confides to Alice that Bobs been sexually harassing her and Della.  With Alices support, Carol then reports Bob.  A confidential investigation does not find that Bob broke any laws, but does show that he violated company policy.  (Later, people would find out that things were very serious, but Ethan didnt know everything at the time.)  The morale and performance of Bobs team suffers.  Ethan does not renew Bobs contract when it runs out in a few months, which no one questions.  Alice transfers out anyway, and several other employees also leave.Ethan sends a copy of the investigation to company headquarters.  However, in public, he thanks Bob for his services to the company and acts like hes leaving on cordial terms.  Bob tells everyone that Alice is a diva, and that he wanted to move closer to his family.  Bob is hired by another branch of the same company.  Hes much more successful there, and becomes a rising star again.  Carol and Della are upset, but the company brushes them off, saying that Ethan already investigated their complaints to a conclusion.Years later, all three women are finally ready to speak out on the record, and even more anonymously.  All of this and more comes out in the open.  It gives the company, which was already in the middle of other scandals, a black eye.  This time, Bob is immediately fired.   The CEO, Fiona, pretends shes shocked at these new allegations shes never heard before, but Alice has the e-mails that prove Fiona is lying.  The board fires Fiona.Assume that each of these people (except possibly Carol and Della) would count as a public figure in a defamation suit.What I Most Want to KnowRight now, I would especially like to understand the position Ethan was in.  Clearly there were better ways for him to have handled this, but was there a good way to publicly shame Bob, and prevent him from getting his next job, without breaking Carols confidence?  (Im not asking whether someone could warn about him through the grapevine.  Someone might have.)Trying to find an answer to this has raised other directly-related issues, about which Ive heard contradictory or confusing answers.Could Bob Sue Over a Public Warning?In particular, someone suggested to me that the company could have released a statement saying, After an investigation of Bob for unprofessional conduct, his contract was not renewed,  This sentence is literally true, although it conveys the clear implication to me that Bob is guilty and it would have also stopped Bob from getting lucrative job offers.Could there have been grounds for a lawsuit?  Perhaps alleging defamation by implication, perhaps alleging that the so-called investigation had been a sham, perhaps alleging that Alice was the source of these accusations in order to sabotage his career?Despite having had people tell me that its impossible, I have seen cases in the same jurisdiction of employers getting sued for statements similar to that, and having to settle the case.  Its possible those cases turned on details I dont fully appreciate.ETA:It turns out that Ethan quietly suspended Bob, during some downtime, and kept that a secret.  He also warned Bobs next employer that there had been an investigation, but apparently no more than that.Wouldnt  also have protected Ethan?Would a Lawsuit from Bob be Dangerous?The company did have statements from witnesses, and revealing them would only have made Bob look worse, but the witnesses had good reasons not to want to come forward or to testify.  Bob did not necessarily know this.  Carol and Della were both too poor to pay any damages anyway, but he didnt necessarily know which women told on him, either.Ive heard the assertion that such a suit would have been dismissed before getting to discovery, or even fall under Oregons anti-SLAPP law.  Im skeptical.  Would a truth defense for a statement such as, We completed an investigation of Bob for professional misconduct, require disclosing the investigation?  Would a defense that the investigation gave them legitimate reasons to believe that the insinuation they made is true require them to disclose it?  Are there other good defenses that could have gotten the lawsuit dismissed as frivolous?Would Defending the Lawsuit have Exposed Carol?Would the identities of the witnesses have been redacted?  At least from the public record, even if Bob could easily have figured it out?  Could his accusers have been compelled to testify?  Would the testimony of the interviewer be enough to establish the validity of the investigation?If Alice had made a public accusation, directly or by implication, could she have defended herself in court without naming the witness who informed her?The Bottom LineIs it credible that Ethan had a good legal reason to keep this in the family for Carols sake?","answer":"was there a good way to publicly shame Bob, and prevent him from getting his next job, without breaking Carols confidence?Apparently not. The conclusion that Bob's violations of company policy are short of breaking any laws leaves little to no reason for publicly shaming him. Details on the company policy, the facts, and the statements might make a difference, but your description is generic in that regard and would require us to speculate on what they could be.Could there have been grounds for a lawsuit?It largely depends on the terms of the publications, their veracity &amp; import, and --if false or unfounded-- their effect on Bob's prospects and\/or whether the statements are defamatory per se.Would a truth defense for a statement such as, We completed an investigation of Bob for professional misconduct, require disclosing the investigation?Yes. A defendant has the burden to prove the [affirmative] defense(s) on which he intends to premise his position.Note that the statement We completed an investigation of Bob for professional misconduct in and of itself is not really a truth defense because it is inconclusive as to whether Bob was found to have incurred misconduct. The sole fact that Bob was investigated does not justify imputing to him disreputable conduct.Would a defense that the investigation gave them legitimate reasons to believe that the insinuation they made is true require them to disclose it?Yes. Bob is entitled to gather from the defendant the bases for the latter's allegations. Otherwise defamers would systematically elude their liability by sticking to generic allegations only.Are there other good defenses that could have gotten the lawsuit dismissed as frivolous?That requires us to speculate because we are given no details about the underlying events, Bob's pleadings, the evidence obtained during discovery, and so forth.That being said, a prevailing defense does not imply that the lawsuit is frivolous.Would the identities of the witnesses have been redacted?No. The fact that Bob did not break any laws suggests that the matter does not warrant measures akin to witness protection. Nor does your description reflect that the communications are protected by some privilege.Is it credible that Ethan had a good legal reason to keep this in the family for Carols sake?That is unanswerable because, inter alia, it is not about the law, it is unclear what exactly Carol's sake entails, and the substance of the company's other scandals as well as Ethan's reason(s) are unspecified. Ethan's good legal reason does not necessarily have to protect or advance Carol's sake."}
{"question":"I currently live in Washington state. I am planning on moving to Utah fairly soon. A friend of mine would like to sell me their AR-15 rifle.  I can't find any information outlining the restrictions on moving to a different state with a firearm. I would like to believe that so long as the firearm is legal in the state I am moving to, that I would be able to bring it, no problem. My question is, if I purchase an AR-15 in Washington and move to Utah, would I be able to bring the gun, and if so is there any extra registration, paperwork, or fees I need to deal with?","answer":"For regular firearms you only have to comply with the laws of the state to which you are moving.  Since Utah (presently) has no state-specific restrictions on ownership or possession of AR-15 rifles that means in this case, as you say, 'no problem.'(The only exception would be registered NFA items &ndash; e.g., machine-guns, suppressors, SBR, SBS, DD, AOW &ndash; for which the BATFE typically requires notice when you are moving them interstate.  But if you have gone through the trouble of registering such an item, you probably already know that.)Finally, you have to exercise some care in the actual interstate transportation of firearms:  If you are passing through a jurisdiction where possession of them is restricted then you have to follow the rules provided in the .

{"question":"Suppose that a lender lends a debtor $10000 with the collateral of 1 Bitcoin. Now, if the debtor defaults the lender can sell the collateral and recover the original debt.However, suppose the collateral declines below the original value of the loan. Suppose the debtor defaults and now the collateral is only worth $9000, so after selling the debtor still owes $1000. Does the rest of the debt become unsecured debt? Can the lender recover from the general estate of the debtor?I am generally interested in how this applies in the United States, but if you wish to answer for another jurisdiction, please indicate which jurisdiction your answer assumes.","answer":"<h3>Short Answer<\/h3>Does a secured loan create obligations beyond the collateral assets?The vast majority of the time it does.<h3>Long Answer<\/h3>The default rule is that security interests in assets other than real property is a recourse debt under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) (a model statute that individual states can enact voluntarily) and the applicable common law (which is uniform almost everyplace except Louisiana and Puerto Rico).This means that deficiency judgments are allowed if the seized collateral is insufficient to pay the loan in full.It also means that the lender can sue on the debt without foreclosing the collateral at all if the lender wishes to do so.A note and security agreement can be made expressly non-recourse which limits recovery to seizure of the collateral and precludes a suit on the debt itself. A secured loan can also become non-recourse if the unsecured debt is discharged in bankruptcy, or if the deadline for filing a claim expires in a probate case. Neither bankruptcy nor the probate claims process extinguish the rights of a secured creditor in the collateral, even if the right to bring a suit on the debt itself is terminated.Special tax rules (that, in substance, disallow tax losses with no economic effect) apply to non-recourse debts (especially the special case of limited liability companies which are taxed as general partnerships but subject to special non-recourse debt rules).When filing a claim in bankruptcy, if the collateral is worth less than the debt, two claims must be filed. One secured claim in an amount equal to the value of the collateral and a second unsecured claim in the amount by which the debt exceeds the value of the collateral.In the case of secured debts in real property, most states mirror the personal property rule (which is very close to Uniform since every state, territory and district in the U.S. had adopted Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code governing security interests in property other than real estate). But in a few states (including California), security interests in owner occupied residential real estate (a.k.a. mortgages, liens, encumbrances, or deeds of trust) are truly, or in practice are, effectively non-recourse.Be aware also that there are a handful of isolated, mostly state specific but some federal exceptions.The most pertinent federal exception is for swap agreements and certain other kinds of derivatives (exceptions which are found primarily in the bankruptcy code) involving setoffs.There is a section of the Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 involving strict settlements that rarely applies except in pawn arrangements.There are also a number of statutory liens (mostly perfected by possession of the collateral rather than by a UCC-1 financing statement) that create a security interest in collateral by operation of law without a signed security agreement that are sometimes non-recourse (e.g. auto mechanic's liens in selected states)."}
{"question":"Various questions so far have asked about the constitutionality, or not, of various freemen theories, which include 'Fourteenth Amendment' citizens and is quite possibly a variant of the Sovereign Citizen movement.Essentially, these are theories that treat the government and its laws as a contract, that can only be enforced with the consent of the governed.What I'd be interested in is have these theories ever been upheld by a court of law? For example, freemen theories have been used at times to reject courts' jurisdictions, attempt to enforce or invalidate debt, and many others.It might be difficult to prove a negative, but with theories like these, I'd be willing to bet that if there's a court anywhere that has upheld any of them, we'd know all about it.I'm looking for a detailed response that describes and debunks prominent variants of these theories  or shows that they've succeeded.","answer":"My research has turned up no instances of anyone successfully advocating these ideas in court.These are crackpot pseudo-legal theories that have no legal validity whatsoever. And are also a bit troublesome and problematic for the rest of us.They are mostly advocated by people who:don't want to pay taxes or otherwise conform to laws they don't like;are conspiracy-minded; andhave come across a pseudo-legal theory that helps them justify their position.For example, :Freemen believe that statute law is a contract, and that individuals can therefore opt out of statute law, choosing instead to live under what they call common (case) and natural laws. Under their theory, natural laws require only that individuals do not harm others, do not damage the property of others, and do not use fraud or mischief in contracts. They say that all people have two parts to their existence  their body and their legal person. The latter is represented by the individual's birth certificate; some freemen claim that it is entirely limited to the birth certificate. Under this theory, a strawman is created when a birth certificate is issued, and this strawman is the entity who is subject to statutory law. The physical self is referred to by a slightly different name  for example John of the family Smith, as opposed to John Smith.In 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington tried and convicted Kenneth Wayne Leaming for retaliation by making false claims and wrote:Defendant [Kenneth Wayne Leaming] is apparently a member of a group loosely styled sovereign citizens. The Court has deduced this from a number of Defendants peculiar habits.First, like Mr. Leaming, sovereign citizens are fascinated by capitalization. They appear to believe that capitalizing names has some sort of legal effect. For example, Defendant writes that the REGISTERED FACTS appearing in the above Paragraph evidence the uncontroverted and uncontrovertible FACTS that the SLAVERY SYSTEMS operated in the names UNITED STATES, United States, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and United States of America . . . are terminated nunc pro tunc by public policy, U.C.C. 1-103 . . . . (Def.s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 2.) He appears to believe that by capitalizing United States, he is referring to a different entity than the federal government. For better or for worse, its the same country.Second, sovereign citizens, like Mr. Leaming, love grandiose legalese. COMES NOW, Kenneth Wayne, born free to the family Leaming, [date of birth redacted], constituent to The People of the State of Washington constituted 1878 and admitted to the union 22 February 1889 by Act of Congress, a Man, State of Body competent to be a witness and having First Hand Knowledge of The FACTS . . . . (Def.s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 1.)Third, Defendant evinces, like all sovereign citizens, a belief that the federal government is not real and that he does not have to follow the law. Thus, Defendant argues that as a result of the REGISTERED FACTS, the states of body, persons, actors and other parties perpetuating the above captioned transaction(s) [i.e., the Court and prosecutors] are engaged . . . in acts of TREASON, and if unknowingly as victims of TREASON and FRAUD . . . . (Def.s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 2.)The Court therefore feels some measure of responsibility to inform Defendant that all the fancy legal-sounding things he has read on the internet are make-believe......<h3>Paper Terrorism<\/h3>One particularly problematic successful tactic employed by these individuals is the filing of false liens. They take advantage of the fact that property liens are not vetted prior to being recorded. These false liens illegally cloud the title to real property and adversely affect the sale of property by adding unnecessary time and expense to the process."}
{"question":"I was stopped for holding my phone while driving; I was listening to a podcast on speaker, and the phone was locked.In , subsection (b) saysA person may not operate a motor vehicle on a roadway while using an electronic communication device.Prior to , this subsection was less vague:A person may not operate a motor vehicle on a roadway while using an electronic communication device to compose, send, or read an electronic message.Was I in violation of Illinois' 'hands-free phone' law?What constitutes use in this context?How could the prosecutor prove I was actually using, and not just holding, a phone? (I wasn't fined; this is a hypothetical question)","answer":"What a  can be difficult to determine.There are several approaches to statutory interpretation that could be helpful:: The plain meaning doesn't confine 'use' to a few particular types of uses.The plain text provides an expansive prohibition on any use of an electronic communication device.:The previous version of the subsection did limit prohibited uses to only composing, sending, or reading electronic messages. Given the amendment, it seems that the legislature no longer desired that limitation., Rep. D'Amico stated the purpose of the bill was to '[expand] the prohibition on driving while using an electronic communication device to include uses beyond composing, sending, or reading an electronic message.'During , when asked what a person should do that doesn't have Bluetooth, Rep. D'Amico suggested 'You put it on speaker phone'. When asked, 'Where would you place the phone?', Rep D'Amico replied, 'Wherever you feel like; just not next to your ear.'During the same debate, D'Amico described the bill: 'What House Bill 1247 does is ban handheld cell phones while driving a vehicle.'In my opinion, the declaration of the bill's sponsor, and the debate surrounding the bill treated it as expanding the prohibition from including only texting and email to also include voice conversations.As far as I can tell, the full scope of 'using' under this statute hasn't been tested in court, but I could see this going either way. The plain text provides an expansive prohibition on any use of an electronic communication device. However, a court might also be convinced by the legislative intent that only aims to add handheld voice communications to the previous list of prohibited activities (or it least it could be argued that this is the case).Further, under a , a court could even look beyond the explicit legislative intent and find that the core purpose was to prevent distraction, in which case 'using' could include any activity on your electronic device that distracts you as if you were texting, or making a phone call (eg. selecting the next song to play in your music app)."}
{"question":"According to Emmerich de Vattel, in his The Law of Nations or The Principles of Natural Law, first published in 1758, he writes:It is a much discussed question whether a sovereign must observe the ordinary laws of war in dealing with rebellious subjects who have openly taken up arms against him. A flatterer at court or a cruel tyrant will immediately answer that the laws of war is not made for rebels who deserve only death.To which he replies:In order to understand clearly what conduct a sovereign should observe we must first of all recall that the rights of the sovereign are derived wholly [and not in part] from the rights of the State itself or of civil society, from the duties entrusted to him, and from the obligation he is to watch over the welfare of the nation, to procure its greatest happiness and to maintain order, peace and justice in the country.Q. Is this stipulated in any convention of International law in more or less this form?I don't expect the exact wording to be followed, but a very similar sentiment and thought.","answer":"No.  De Vatel is waxing philosophical.

It seems to say that school employees act as agents of the state when they perform their duties of the school.It looks like the standard for a school employee to search is not probable cause, but rather if the search is 'reasonable' - which gives a wide range of areas open to interpretation.

{"question":"Update to clarify what is meant by 'actually legal': my question is whether, in states that voted recreational marijuana use to be legal, it is possible for anyone in the US Government (federal, state, or local) to prosecute and convict you for using marijuana recreationally.My understanding is that, for example, Nevada voted it to be legal recreationally, but it's still illegal at the federal level. And so, there's a difference in what federal law says, and what state law says. How is this difference reconciled?Also, how is it possible for different jurisdictions to create laws that contradict one another? Shouldn't there be a filtering process that wouldn't allow the non-superseding jurisdiction to pass the law in the first place?","answer":"In the United States, individual members (States) of the union are allowed to make their own constitutions and state laws &amp; regulations. This includes laws that may contradict Federal law, although this is a grey area.  It usually comes down to enforcement: Federal laws are usually enforced by Federal law enforcement as they can not force states to do so.Further more, State prosecutors will usually not attempt to prosecute you for a Federal law infraction. Only Federal prosecutors OR the department of justice will do this.To see a more detailed explanation on this, look at this  article."}
{"question":"Location: United StatesLet's say I am the first person to use my company name in a business transaction. However, since I did not register my business name as a trademark, can someone else in the United States use the same business name as mines?","answer":"Both are to some extent correct, but as might be expected, the USPTO site is more accurate. Trademarks owned by virtue of use, rather than  registration, are protected only in the market area in where actual use can be documented.  Even state registration may be limited to a geographic market area in which use can be shown, and may not extend to the whole state unless use throughout the state, or at least in most major markets in the state, can be shown.As discussed in the news story  The owners of a small restaurant branded Burger King secured a state-level trademark on that name, but it only serves to exclude the well-known fast-food chain from a 20-mile circle.Remember, the prime purpose of a trademark is to identify the source of goods or services, and to prevent one supplier from benefiting by the reputation of another. In an area where the first supplier does not do business, there is considered to be no such risk of unfair competition.Also, nationwide protection is one of the benefits of federal registration.In addition, a mark is only protected for the same class of goods or services. Nationwide use of Pear as a mark for a brand of computer would not prevent use of the same  word as a mark for a brand of automobile, say, or for a restaurant chain.Note also that trademarks are normally at most national in scope.  A US Federal registration will offer no protection in Canada, or any other country."}
{"question":"So, the prospect of siccing a semper tyrannis on the current POTUS has been discussed for the past quarter millennium or so. This has left me wondering, what sort of laws are there against murdering, or otherwise criminally ending the life of, the president compared to a regular citizen?","answer":"Murdering a sitting President is singled out as a separate federal crime from murder, in general, which is another crime that could be brought in such a case. See .This is notable because (1) it carries a possible death penalty even if the murder took place in a state without a death penalty, (2) it would be tried in a federal district court and commenced by federal prosecutors, rather than in a state court with state prosecutors (and usually a smaller jury pool area than federal court), and (3) the number of appeals from a federal conviction is significantly smaller than the number of appeals from a state court criminal conviction. This statute is an exception to the posse comitatus statute which forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic criminal laws. It also has extraterritorial jurisdiction so it can be used to pursue offenders outside the U.S. and crimes committed outside the U.S.There are two direct appeals possible (the U.S. Court of Appeals and then the U.S. Supreme Court), and one collateral attack in a trial court with two direct appeals from that possible for a total of five post-trial proceedings.State courts usually have up to ten post-trial proceedings (three direct appeals to intermediate state appeals court, state supreme court and U.S. Supreme Court, a state collateral attack with three direct appeals, and a federal collateral attack with two direct appeals) although some states send death penalty cases directly from a trial court to the state supreme court by statute or because the state doesn't have an intermediate appellate court, reducing the number of post-trial court proceedings from ten to eight.So federal court criminal prosecutions become final sooner.The statute states that:(a) Whoever kills (1) any individual who is the President of theUnited States, the President-elect, the Vice President, or, if thereis no Vice President, the officer next in the order of succession tothe Office of the President of the United States, the VicePresident-elect, or any person who is acting as President under theConstitution and laws of the United States, or (2) any personappointed under section 105(a)(2)(A) of title 3 employed in theExecutive Office of the President or appointed under section106(a)(1)(A) of title 3 employed in the Office of the Vice President,shall be punished as provided by sections 1111 and 1112 of this title [ed. which allows for the death penalty or other punishments based upon the offender's mens rea]. . . .(c)Whoever attempts to kill . . . any individual designated insubsection (a) of this section shall be punished by imprisonment forany term of years or for life.(d)If two or more persons conspire to kill . . . any individualdesignated in subsection (a) of this section and one or more of suchpersons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shallbe punished (1) by imprisonment for any term of years or for life, or(2) by death or imprisonment for any term of years or for life, ifdeath results to such individual. . . .(f) The terms President-elect and Vice-President-elect as used inthis section shall mean such persons as are the apparent successfulcandidates for the offices of President and Vice President,respectively, as ascertained from the results of the general electionsheld to determine the electors of President and Vice President inaccordance with title 3, United States Code, sections 1 and 2.(g) The Attorney General of the United States, in his discretion isauthorized to pay an amount not to exceed $100,000 for information andservices concerning a violation of subsection (a)(1).

{"question":"I'm a member of a college fraternity that has a vending machine their basement that sells cans Miller High Life.It's not accessible to the public and it doesn't accept cash, only fraternity members have ID cards that can buy from it. When a fraternity issued ID card is swiped, the machine records the id number and at the end of the month a bill is issued with a charge $0.75 per vending machine purchase.We are in the United States and some of our fraternity members aren't 21 years old. I assume this is a problem since you can't sell alcohol to minors and the machine is recording an ID number of the sale proving that booze was sold to someone under 21. Who in the fraternity would be prosecuted if this became an issue?Would the machine be safer if it just accepted cash (so that no electronic paper trail was created), with a big warning sign WINK WINK that anyone under the age of 21 was strictly prohibited from purchasing from it?","answer":"  Who in the fraternity would be prosecuted if this became an issue?A lot of people could be held liable for this, including people who are not even in the fraternity. Anyone who has knowledge of the machine or the fact that it was possible for minors to access alcohol through it could technically be held liable if a prosecutor wanted to make that case. Presumably the building is owned by someone else and just leased out to fraternity members, and they very well could be held liable for sale to minors also.  Would the machine be safer if it just accepted cash (so that no electronic paper trail was created), with a big warning sign WINK WINK that anyone under the age of 21 was strictly prohibited from purchasing from it?No. Payment method is irrelevant here. There are a number of states that legally allow vending machines to sell alcohol, but vendors are required to verify the age of any person accessing them and ensure that those cards aren't being used by people not authorized. What you describe is an extremely relaxed environment where admittedly no one is attempting to verify identities.The 'accepting cash' scenario is no different than a liquor store selling alcohol to anyone that comes in just because they're willing to pay with cash instead of a credit card. Sales to minors laws are not 'as long as you warn them, you're safe' laws. They require vendors to actively check IDs and ensure that alcohol is not landing in the hands of minors. Accepting cash just to erase the evidence doesn't meet that burden.There are a lot of legal troubles with the situation that could get a lot of people charged with multiple offenses. That you have underage fraternity members living there suggests you should not have alcohol readily accessible in the house at all, as most state laws expressly forbid providing access to alcohol, not just serving or selling. Them being there provides access to it, even if it's just a case in the fridge with a note on it.Not to mention, you technically cannot sell alcohol, as I highly doubt your fraternity has a liquor license to be able to do so. There's a big difference between asking everyone to pitch in to buy the case versus actively selling individual cans through a vending machine. The vending machine itself is violating liquor laws in your state merely by existing."}
{"question":"Oral arguments were recently held before the supreme court in . The discussion was almost exclusively about the 1st amendment's free speech provision and what kinds of business products\/services convey a message and therefore should constitute protected speech. The same was true in their petition for certiorari, the replies, and the few amicus briefs I read. My question is about a few other arguments I expected to hear. The first deals with the religious free exercise clause of the 1st amendment:Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or  prohibiting the free exercise thereofIt was agreed upon by both sides that the baker refused to bake the cake in question on religious grounds. Is there precedent to suggest that a free exercise claim would not have prevailed?The second argument I expected has to do with the 13th amendment of the United States constitution:Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for  crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist  within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.It seems to me that the baker could have argued that being forced to provide a service that he did not want to provide constitutes involuntary servitude. I am aware that this amendment was introduced to end slavery, but I don't believe this changes what those words mean, does it? Is there precedent that suggests that this interpretation is rejected by the courts or that such an argument would not have been successful? The closest case I could find that might address this is Butler v. Perry, but this case doesn't seem to say anything about one citizen working for another, it was about citizens working for the government. ","answer":"Regarding the Thirteenth Amendment claim, a similar argument reached the Supreme Court during the Civil Rights Era in , and was rejected.Quoting from the opinion of the Court:  The appellant contends [...] that, by requiring appellant to rent available rooms to Negroes against its will, Congress is subjecting it to involuntary servitude in contravention of the Thirteenth Amendment.The Court responded:  We find no merit in the remainder of appellant's contentions, including that of 'involuntary servitude.' As we have seen, 32 States prohibit racial discrimination in public accommodations. These laws but codify the common law innkeeper rule, which long predated the Thirteenth Amendment. It is difficult to believe that the Amendment was intended to abrogate this principle. Indeed, the opinion of the Court in the Civil Rights Cases is to the contrary as we have seen, it having noted with approval the laws of 'all the States' prohibiting discrimination. We could not say that the requirements of the Act in this regard are in any way 'akin to African slavery.' Butler v. Perry, 240 U. S. 328, 240 U. S. 332 (1916).Justice Black, in his concurrence, was even less impressed by this argument, and relegated his response to a footnote:  The motel's argument that Title II violates the Thirteenth Amendment is so insubstantial that it requires no further discussion.The appellant's other arguments were also rejected, and the lower court's decision was affirmed 9-0.  The other concurrences don't seem to have mentioned this argument specifically.There is further discussion and background of this argument in   Christopher W. Schmidt.

Prosecutorial discretion is generally treated as sacrosanct, and judges are loath to get involved in second-guessing those decisions. From what I can see, no state has ever endorsed Hamstead.There are, however, many states that allow citizens to initiate proceedings directly by presenting a probable-cause affidavit to a judge or other magistrate.

{"question":"I am currently working part-time as an independent contractor, software developer, in the United States for a startup my friend founded. I saw it mostly as helping a friend, so we never formalized the agreement (i.e. I have not signed any statement of work or otherwise agreements with the startup), however I am clearly paid with the startup's money.Over the last few months the startup has been having troubles with one of the three founders, and long story short, my friend and one other founder are deciding to leave the company and create a competitor business on their own. The three current founders have equal equity and voting rights, so technically the two leaving could instead push out the third partner, but they are worried that partner would torpedo the company's reputation if they did so they would prefer to just quietly start fresh.So on to the question, my friend would like to take the code I have written with them to their new company. I understand if I were an employee, all my work would inherently be the IP of the original company, however because I am a contractor - and notably have not signed any formal agreements to the current company, could we have any legal claim that I independently own my code and get to chose who I allow to use it?One idea I had was, since I have not yet signed any agreement with thecurrent company, we could enter into a licensing agreement thatclearly indicates I own the code and they are simply licensing itfrom me. At which point the new company could also license my codefrom me. However I'm not sure if it's legal to enter such anagreement at this stage, given the intent is clearly to take the IPwith them.Another consideration I had was that since the two founders havemajority voting, and could technically vote \/ sign whateverthey wanted without the third founder's agreement, they could just make the decisionbefore leaving to give me ownership of the code (e.g. \"sell\" it to mefor $1). But here again I'm not sure if that's legal, given theywould be clearly acting against the best interest of their currentcompany and could probably be sued by external shareholders.Are there any legal options we can take to move the IP I've developed to the new company? And would I be putting myself at legal risk by agreeing to any of this (e.g. if the founders decided f- it and to just take the code, is it illegal for me to keep working on it)?","answer":"Is this ?There is an arguable case to be made that you are an employee for copyright law purposes and, if so, the copyright belongs to the company.The closer an employment relationship comes to regular, salaried employment, the more likely it is that a work created within the scope of that employment will be a work made for hire. But because no precise standard exists for determining whether a work is made for hire under part 1 of the definition in section 101 of the copyright law, consultation with a lawyer may be advisable.Second, if you do own the copyright, there is clearly an implied licence with the company to allow them to use it. It is arguable that the licence is exclusive since the software is bespoke and made specifically for the company.Can you sign an agreement nowYes, but \u2026It is clear that the purpose of signing the agreement is to screw the company over (with the compliance of 2 of the directors). Thats a contract entered into in bad faith and possibly for an illegal purpose and would likely be found invalid.You need to understand that the company is a distinct legal entity from its owners and it has its own rights. People make the mistake of thinking the owners are the company: they arent.The two rebel founders are on dangerous legal ground. Assuming they are the directors of the company, they have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company. That is, they must put the companys interests ahead of their own. It is clearly not in the companys interest to have a rival business start so they cannot plan to do that while they are directors - they need to resign first.You are not so much at risk - as an employee\/contractor your duty is to follow the directions of the company (the company - not a faction within the company). However, if you aid the other two in what might be a crime, you could be in trouble."}

{"question":"Duress and Necessity are two  that can be argued for acquittal of a criminal charge.However I can't find clear law or precedent for either in the United States.Are they viable defenses in practice?Does any jurisprudence provide particular guidelines to their application in criminal law?Is \"duress\" limited to circumstances of a   e.g., extortion, blackmail, or psychological manipulation  viable affirmative defenses under legal doctrine of duress?","answer":"Yes, both duress and necessity remain viable defenses.The contours of these defenses will vary from state to state, but many states use the Model Penal Code. lays out the necessity defense, which it calls justification:Conduct that the actor believes to be necessary to avoid a harm or evil to himself or to another is justifiable, provided that:(a) the harm or evil sought to be avoided by such conduct is greater than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged; and(b) neither the Code nor other law defining the offense provides exceptions or defenses dealing with the specific situation involved; and(c) a legislative purpose to exclude the justification claimed does not otherwise plainly appear. lays out the standard for duress:It is an affirmative defense that the actor engaged in the conduct charged to constitute an offense because he was coerced to do so by the use of, or a threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the person of another, that a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist.So MPC \u00a7 2.09 does not explicitly make imminence a requirement for the duress defense, but it adopts an objective standard, which permits the jury to factor in that consideration. A person of reasonable firmness would be less able to resist robbing a bank if the threat was to kill their child in 30 seconds than if the threat was to kill their grandmother in 50 years, during which the defendant can call the police to investigate the threat and the odds are good that granny dies anyway.I'd guess most duress cases fall somewhere in the middle, so it becomes a question for the jury whether the threat was serious enough and imminent enough to merit justification."}

However, city centers are densily inhabited areas, so the default is banned.However, in the countryside, flying a UAV does not require a special license, as long as the  are followed (150 m above ground, 30 meters of any obstacle, daytime only, line of sight, etc).

{"question":"I want to be a bit vague on specific details and names as this is an active legal issue but in the state of Utah I was terminated a few months back after a couple years of employment for my significant other's religion. To be clear, I do not belong to that religious group, the predominate religion of Utah, though my S\/O does as does my former supervisor. When my supervisor dug into it and found out her religious affiliation he was heavily critical of her, and terminated me shortly after a discussion where he was quite critical of our relationship and was abusive in his thoughts on her.I am filing with the UALD & EEOC jointly, however I am looking for some statutes and rulings relevant to this to help strengthen my argument in this case against my former employer as this case is somewhat unusual. Most notably I am not being discriminated because of the specifics of my own religion, or of not belonging to a particular religion but because I am dating someone of a particular religion while I do not belong to it myself. The more conservative members of this particular religion, as communicated to me by my supervisor, believe that they should not be in inter-faith relationships.UPDATE:I should update this that the UALD ruled that I was not discriminated against for my religion and after my employer slandered me for nearly a year, making it nearly impossible to work in my industry, pushing me to bankruptcy, the UALD ruling gave me the right to sue but did not rule in my favor. My lawyer suggested I should not sue as the company would continue slandering me if I lost, but would likely stop (they did) if I dropped it but still had the option to sue. All in all my finances were ruined, my career required life support, and I was out thousands of dollars on lawyers.Essentially the investigator was overly focused on what my religion is and didn't\/couldn't understand where discrimination actually occurred.The employer's legal team did as much as they could to confuse the situation further. I learned my lesson on challenging the separation of church and state in Utah, as well as taking on a public company that spends millions on lawyers every year. I discovered after starting the process thanks to an answer below that the UALD rules in favor of less than 1% of employees in discrimination claims.","answer":"Utah laws Title 34A (Utah Labor Code), Chapter 5 (Utah Antidiscrimination Act) provides that:  (1)    It is a discriminatory or prohibited employment practice to take an action described in Subsections (1)(a) through (g).  (a)         (i)  An employer may not refuse to hire, promote, discharge, demote, or terminate a person, or to retaliate against, harass, or discriminate in matters of compensation or in terms, privileges, and conditions of employment against a person otherwise qualified, because of:  ...            (F) religion;       It does not say 'the employee's religion'. However, under subsection (3)(a) of section 106, if religion (or any of the other categories protected under subsection (1)(a) is a bona fide occupational qualification, it may be the basis of a decision to hire, fire, or other employment actions. Section 106 does not apply to religious organizations, in any of various organizational formats, according to section 102. An employer is defined in  as:  a person employing 15 or more employees within the state for each working day in each of 20 calendar weeks or more in the current or preceding calendar year.(In addition to various governmental organizations) Nothing in section 106 specifically mentions discrimination because of the religion of a spouse or dating partner. But it does say 'because of religion' without saying whose. has addiitonal information.Note also that even where it is found that an employer did not in fact unlawfully discriminate, if an employee complains about what the employee believes in good faith to be unlawful employment practices, and the employer takes adverse actions because of such complaints, that may still be unlawful retaliation. The case of  deals with such a case. Other sources have suggested that retaliation is sometimes easier to prove than the initial act of discrimination is.Most large multi-national companies have internal anti-discrimination policies, often ones stricter than any law requires. The one i work for makes it very clear that any such action should be reported to HR or to a designated high-level office, and promises that serious action will be taken against managers enraging in such discrimination. It has even distributed videos in which various employees describe how they reported such improper practices and how the company responded. Of course, I don't know how your former employer's policies on such things read, or how they are enforced in practice. But it might be that going over the head of the supervisor would resolve this without legal action. In some cases, publicity can induce a company to 'do the right thing' when it might not be legally compelled to.  Discusses the UALD and the state of enforcement of the law."}
{"question":"When I first heard Alessia Cara's song 'Here' I thought she had directly sampled Portishead's 'Glory Box' which in turn samples Isaac Hayes' 'Ike's Rap II'.  I later found this was not true, but this kind of sampling-a-sample situation is not uncommon.  WhoSampled.com terms this a 'sample chain'.  In such chains who is owed royalties?  Had Alessia Cara sampled Portishead would she owe royalties to Portishead, Isaac Hayes or both?","answer":"Short answer: We need to know more about the licensing agreements in question to answer this question.This answer is based upon United States copyright law in light of the examples given in the question, although the result under the laws of most countries with copyright laws that are part of the international copyright regime would be similar. Most, but not all, countries in the world provide meaningful copyright protections pursuant to this regime.Royalties are paid only if there is a license in place, in which case the answer would turn on the terms of the licenses in question. If someone fails to obtain a license, they can be sued for violating a copyright and the amounts paid in those cases would be damages for infringement of a copyright, not royalties.Copyright Liability In The Absence Of Any LicensesIf no one obtains licenses from anyone, then no royalties will be paid, but someone might be entitled to damages if they bring a copyright infringement lawsuit. Since the licenses are negotiated in the shadow of the copyright infringement liability that would apply if licenses are not obtained, the analysis begins with copyright liability in the absence of any agreements.Copyright Liability To The Owner Of The Original SourceIf licenses were not obtained by anyone, the owner of the original source would have a right to sue the producer of the end product for a copyright violation. Similarly, the owner of the original source would have a right to sue the producer of the intermediate source for a copyright violation.Copyright Liability To The Owner Of The Intermediate SourceBut, if licenses were not obtained by anyone, would the owner of the intermediate source also have a right to sue the produce of the end product for copyright violation? This would be a closer question. Ordinarily, the answer would be 'yes' and this would probably still apply to the extent that non-infringing parts of the intermediate source were sampled. But, the intermediate source could probably not sue the producer of the end product for merely sampling a part of the intermediate source that was itself a sample of the original material, since the copyright to that material would belong to the owner of the copyright to the original source and not the intermediate source.Further, the court might deny the owner of the intermediate source suing the producer of the end product any relief at all, on the theory that the infringing sampling in the intermediate source tainted the entire intermediate source as infringing and\/or was an instance of the intermediate source owner coming into the court with unclean hands such that the intermediate source owner should not be entitled to relief at all.Royalties Paid Pursuant To Licensing AgreementsRoyalties could be owed to the licensor of the original source, to the licensor of the intermediate source, or to both of them, depending upon the extent of the material resampled and the terms of the licensing agreement, if any, between the original source and the intermediate source.The License From The Owner Of The Intermediate SourceIf the intermediate source was licensed to the producer of the end product, the licensor of the intermediate source would be entitled to royalties pursuant to that license. The license of the intermediate source to the producer of the end product would normally also include a term warranting that it had the right to license its entire song. But, this warranty would only be true if the producer of the intermediate source obtained a license of the original source that authorized relicensing of samples from the intermediate source including the sampled material. Usually, a license from a licensor of the original source that was well drafted, would give the producer of the intermediate source this right and require the producer of the intermediate source to pay additional royalties to the licensor of the original source for this new revenue stream. But, the quality of licensing agreements varies a great deal.If the license from the intermediate source claimed to have the rights to the entire song, but didn't actual obtain a license to use the original source, then, if the producer of the end product was sued for copyright violation by the owner of the original source's copyright, the licensor of the intermediate source would have to indemnify the producer of the end product for any liability arising from the copyright suit by the owner of the original source (and the intermediate source would probably be sued by the original source's owner for copyright violation as well).Of course, if the sloppy or dishonest licensor of the intermediate source didn't have any money, the right to indemnification would be cold comfort to the producer of the end product.A License From The Original SourceIf the license from the intermediate source expressly stated that it didn't have a right to license certain sampled material, a separate license to the original source would also have to be negotiated by the producer of the end product, and royalties would have to paid directly to the licensor of the original source as well. If the producer of the end product didn't obtain that license, the owner of the original source would have a right to sue the producer of the end product for copyright violation and the intermediate source would not have to indemnify the producer of the end product for damages in that lawsuit.The producer of the end product could also only resample the infringing part of the intermediate source and obtain a license from the original source but not the intermediate source (although it would be easier just to sample the original source directly in a case like that), and pay royalties to the original source but not the intermediate source. The producer of the end product might also only obtain a license from and pay royalties to the original source, if the producer of the end product thought that the intermediate source would not have a right to, or would be unlikely to, sue the producer of the end product because intermediate source was infringing which might deny the owner of the copyright to the intermediate source any relief, or might expose the owner of the intermediate source to suit from the owner the original source if the litigation was expanded by the producer of the end product."}

{"question":"I've been doing some research for a presentation I'm going to do. The proposition would be that a Big Tobacco company (Altria - Phillip Morris) transition into growing and distributing marijuana.My research has led to a lot of skepticism mainly around legality, but also that big tobacco companies are selling a completely different product and prefer to not get more scrutiny and regulations over marijuana.However, my plan only needs to be viable. I am curious about the legality of Altria from getting into this.Would Altria be able to incorporate a completely new company\/open a subsidiary that would operate marijuana growing operations in states that have legalized some form of marijuana? I know that controlling interest in a firm rolls up to the balance sheet of Altria so just wanted to know this wouldn't be an issue.We are looking to target one state that could produce and allow us to legally distribute to all other legalized states (NW Region for Washington, Oregon, California, etc).The industry right now is running into commerce issues because banks are federally regulated, credit\/debit\/bank cards can't by used, so they only operate in cash.","answer":"For Washington, the answer is in part that nobody new can produce marijuana  the period for applying for a license was a month at the end of 2013. But if you set that aside, the regulations governing producer licenses are  spells out license qualifications, wherein lies the rub. Suppose a publicly held corporation wanted to produce, then by WAC 314-55-035, you first determine the 'true parties of interest', which would be 'All corporate officers (or persons with equivalent title) and their spouses. All stockholders and their spouses'. These parties are subject to vetting, and,  After licensure, a true party of interest, including financiers, must  continue to disclose the source of funds for all moneys invested in  the licensed business. The WSLCB must approve these funds prior to  investing them into the business.They operate a ' such as 4+ regulatory violations, which are a permanent disbarment from a marijuana license.Apart from age requirements (everyone at a production facility must be over 21) and the violation filter, there is no specific regulation pertaining to what kind of work you do. However, if the stated rules for publicly held corporations is enforced and they check the criminal histories of all of the true parties of interest, then there is effectively no possibility for a tobacco corporation  or a software corporation  to produce marijuana in Washington. There is in fact a contrast between the definitions of 'true party of interest', with respect to  vs. marijuana licenses. There is a similar criminal vetting of applicants for liquor license which includes board members. For a liquor license, it does not include stockholders in the case of a publicly held corporation, and only includes stockholders with more that 10% interest for a privately held corporation, whereas for a marijuana license it includes all stockholders.

{"question":"Suppose a new law was passed in a US state banning jaywalking, which was not previously illegal in this state. (That's just a random example; the particular offense is not relevant.)It is common for laws to increase penalties for repeated violations. For example, this jaywalking law might specify a $50 fine for a first offense, $100 for a second, $150 for a third, and $300 for a fourth or greater violation.Suppose, however, that it also specifies that if the government can prove that the person did what is now illegal jaywalking before the law was passed, each incident that can be proved counts as a past violation for the purposes of the law. For example, if someone is caught jaywalking for the first time under this law, but the government can also prove that they jaywalked legally twice before the law took effect, this is considered a third offense and leads to a $150 fine.Is this an unconstitutional ex post facto law?","answer":"Is this an unconstitutional ex post facto law?Yes.  Past actions were lawful, and they cant be made unlawful simply because there is irrefutable evidence that they happened.I think youd actually face the same problem with actions for which the statue of limitations has expired.  You cant punish them today for acts which it is unlawful to punish them for today.The closest you could probably get is a maximum sentence taking their history and likelihood of repeating into consideration.  That isnt punishing them for past actions, it is treating them with a reasonable appreciation of their chance of recidivism and\/or threat to the community.Also see : where the court saysIt is settled, by decisions of this Court so well known that their citation may be dispensed with, that any statute which punishes as a crime an act previously committed which was innocent when done, which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime after its commission, or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed, is prohibited as ex post facto"}
{"question":"Since cannabis is still federally illegal, how do states legalize it? Couldn't the federal government still enforce their laws?","answer":"US States cannot and do not claim to repeal the federal laws against cannabis. What they can do is repeal or modify their own laws. Historically the vast majority of  prosecutions in the US have been under state, not federal laws.Nothing requires a state to enforce Federal law.States can also forbid their police and other employees and officials from cooperating in cannabis  cases, passing information to federal law enforcement, or holding accused persons when no Federal warrant is yet available. State support and personnel has often been important to federal investigations.All of this can make it much harder for the FBI and other federal agencies to pursue cannabis  cases in states that have legalized cannabis.Moreover, as a matter of policy, not law,  the Justice Department has, in general, declined to pursue cannabis  cases in such states. This policy could be changed at any time."}

This is then limited by the allowable deductions:<h3>Circumstances in Which the Employer May Make Deductions from Pay<\/h3>Deductions from pay are permissible when an exempt employee: is absent from work for one or more full days for personal reasons other than sickness or disability; for absences of one or more full days due to sickness or disability if the deduction is made in accordance with a bona fide plan, policy or practice of providing compensation for salary lost due to illness; to offset amounts employees receive as jury or witness fees, or for military pay; for penalties imposed in good faith for infractions of safety rules of major significance; or for unpaid disciplinary suspensions of one or more full days imposed in good faith for workplace conduct rule infractions.  Also, an employer is not required to pay the full salary in the initial or terminal week of employment, or for weeks in which an exempt employee takes unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Emphasis MineThis means that as long as the employer has a policy or practice requiring the employee to use Paid Time Off (PTO) for sickness (sick-days), then the employer is allowed to make deductions from the employee's salary for those days.So in short, yes, the employer can require that the employee use PTO to cover sick days, regardless of the actual number of hours worked in that week, month, year, etc. There is currently ."}

But can not pardon people for state crimes.Now imagine a scenario where a POTUS, while sitting in office, is indicted by a particular state Attorney General for a crime, say murder, under state statutes. In that scenario, can POTUS be tried, convicted and jailed for those crimes without being impeached?As a practical matter, could it actually happen?

That question is limited to the issue of indictment only. This question assumes indictment powers and deals with trial, conviction and, most notably, imprisonment. Given the existing answer to that question, these differences seem relevant and could lead to different or more qualifications on the existing answer.And, finally and perhaps more importantly, this question also seeks to extract the details of the logistics of how an arrest and\/or jailing and imprisonment might or might not be feasible and\/or actually occur.","answer":"Yes.In 1872 President Grant was stopped for speeding (on horseback, mind you). The officer, observing that he had stopped the President of the United States, initially let him go with nothing but a verbal warning. Later the same day, the same officer stopped Grant again speeding in the same place. The officer then informed Grant that he would have to be taken in, to which Grant gave a reply encouraging the officer to do his duty. Grant was then taken to the police station where he was charged with speeding, and held until he paid a $20 fine, at which point he was released.In summary, POTUS was:Charged with an offenceDeprived of his liberty for committing said offenceHeld until he served his punishment (paying $20)... all without impeachment. Now, this was a long time ago. I think that today, this is unlikely, since Secret Service would (legal or not) shield the President from arrests (national security reasons). However if a state level authority did manage to arrest the President for a crime and refused to let him go, then the Vice President and cabinet would invoke the 25th Amendment (on the grounds that the President is unable to discharge his duties due to imprisonment), so that the imprisoned person would now be a former president.

If your job requires you to distribute pot, you can be busted under federal distribution laws.

{"question":"A person dies without a will in California, US, and one of several children proposes to take control of real estate. Under what conditions is this legal? How can such action be challenged, if it can be? Assume that title remains in the name of the deceased person.","answer":"When a person dies intestate, California law (or the law of any other state) does not allow a presumed heir to unilaterally legally take over the estate, or part of the estate. This most likely involves a court procedure to decide who gets what. However, if all parties agree, it would be possible for one or more heirs to occupy the house without them owning it  this creates a legal mess that can be difficult and costly to untangle, so presumed-heir squatting is not a good idea. Ultimately, the property will have to go through probate in order for it to be sold to someone else.Obviously, property taxes and other assessments must be paid, but the state does not care who writes the check. There are also liability issues, if the property damages other property (example: the underground oil tank ruptures and pollutes the neighbors' property). If one of the heirs disputes the arrangement, they can sue to force proper disposition of the estate. Creditors may also have a legal claim against the estate.A person can petition the court () to be appointed as the personal representative of the deceased. If someone else has 'taken' the property, this petition triggers questioning as to who is entitled to a share of the estate, and the court will assure that it is distributed according to law, and if this is an adversarial process, each interested party may need to hire their own attorney (thus it is best to reach an agreement beforehand)."}

In principle the chief could limit this authority to those periods when the instructor has been assigned to work, but I don't see any evidence that this is the case.  In particular, you can find  the policy manual on inspection procedures that inspectors are assigned to follow, and it says nothing about 'only perform an inspection when you are on duty'.  (You might also note the discussion on page 2 about unprogrammed inspections and the criteria for performing them.  One indication is 'Complaint about, or observance by anyone of, an imminent hazard', which could include a hazard observed by the inspector himself.)So to your specific questions:  Do any states provide legal authority by statute for an OSHA compliance officer to inspect a site when they are in their own words 'not working'?Yes, California provides authority for an inspector to inspect a site 'during regular working hours, and at other reasonable times when necessary for the protection of safety and health'.  That is the only time-related restriction in the statute.  I don't think that the inspector's comment that he's 'not working' has any legal significance.  What is the test to determine if an individual is acting in their official capacity or acting in their individual capacity?I do not know of any reason to think that any such legal distinction exists.  If Joe Smith has been authorized as an inspector by the Chief of the Division, then Joe Smith can perform inspections and is to be given free access to do so.  End of story.

{"question":"tl;dr: In the U.S., can a 'not guilty by reason of insanity' (a.k.a., NGRI or NGROI) defense be offered after a guilty verdict but before sentencing?In criminal prosecutions in the U.S. it is common and generally considered prudent for a defendant to refuse to expose himself to questioning at trial.  This forces the prosecution to use independent evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the elements of the crime charged were satisfied.A defendant may want to entertain a claim that he was insane at the time a crime was committed, but avoid entering that claim when there is a significant probability that the state will fail to obtain an conviction on the merits of the case against him.So my question is: If a jury returns a guilty verdict for a crime, can a defendant subsequently (but before sentencing) argue to the court that he was insane?  Or does that defense always have to be offered at trial for the crime, before the case is sent to the jury?","answer":"I assume that the person alleges insanity at the time of the crime, and not incompetence to stand trial.

(2) Insanity is a defense which the defendant must establish by a  preponderance of the evidence.This precludes making the argument after trial.

{"question":"Sometimes in criminal cases with a lot of media attention it seems like the charges brought against the defendant are much more ambitious than the public evidence and circumstance would support. Of course it is always possible that there is non-public evidence that would merit more serious charges, but it seems too common for that to be the reason all of the time.Is it advantageous for the prosecutor to charge more than they know they can prove in criminal cases? If it is, what benefits (other than political tough on crime stuff) does it offer? I assume it offers more leverage and room to negotiate in plea deal bargaining and when the overcharging is \"horizontal\" it also allows more opportunities to win the case. Are there benefits beyond that based on how the legal system works?Are there any mechanisms that discourage overcharging a defendant in a case where media attention might be incentivizing more sensational charges?I did search a bit, but most of the things I found were defense attorneys discussing the abusiveness of overcharging. I was hoping to find out if there was more nuance to it. I have a feeling that \"overcharging\" is a loaded term, but I don't know a word for \"charging a little bit more than you can prove for good reason\".","answer":"Overcharging does confer an advantage on the prosecution, specifically, it enhances the prosecutor's position in plea bargaining, allowing the prosecutor to compromise while still getting the actual conviction sought.There is also a more tangible issue. If a prosecutor brings a charge that carries the death penalty as a potential sentence, the jury that will be selected in the case is . This means that people who are morally opposed to the death penalty are excluded from serving as jurors in the case. But since people opposed to the death penalty are also more likely to acquit a criminal defendant than someone not opposed to the death penalty, a death qualified jury is more likely to convict on each and every one of the charges before it, even if everyone on the jury promptly agrees in deliberations that the prosecutor has not established the death penalty carrying charges beyond a reasonable doubt.Thus, bringing a weak death penalty charge both enhances the odds that there will be a conviction of something at trial, and enhances the plea bargaining position of the prosecutor both due to that greater change of prevailing on the merits at trial, and because the worst case scenario still drives the plea bargaining process to a significant extent.Furthermore, jury trials are inherently uncertain ordeals. My working estimate that I share with my clients is that even if the law and the facts seem to perfectly favor one outcome or another, that there is at least a 10% chance that the jury will get the wrong result. And with an additional charge carries the death penalty, or a long term in prison, as a possible sentence, a 10% risk of that happening is enough to strongly encourage a criminal defendant to plea guilty in a case where the defendant might otherwise roll the dice at trial if the more serious charge wasn't on the table.There is also a more subtle issue, which isn't precisely overcharging but is related.At trial, the prosecution is only allowed to introduce evidence which is relevant to the charges presented to a jury. So, for example, suppose that the primary charge at a trial is aggravated assault. In a pure aggravated assault case, the prosecution would probably not be allowed to introduce the fact that the defendant was suspected of being a drug dealer or participant in organized crime.But if a charge of drug dealing the minimum quantity of a drug for a charge of that type that was found in the vicinity of the defendant were brought, even if showing the defendant actually owned those drugs is difficult or impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the drug dealing charge would open up the ability of the prosecution to present all sorts of evidence showing that the defendant was affiliated with a drug dealing cartel. And while this evidence wouldn't be legally relevant to the more serious aggravated assault charge brought, this character attack and legally irrelevant context might sway the jury.Also, even if the jury would have convicted anyway, the presence of additional relevant issues in the case would make it easier for the prosecution to prevail on appeal in the face of a defense argument that the judge improperly allowed the jury to consider irrelevant and prejudicial evidence.As something of an aside, fighting alleged overcharging by the prosecution is one of the core responsibilities of a criminal defense attorney. It is quite rare that someone going to trial on criminal charges is not guilty of some crime (and when this is the case, the criminal defense attorneys' job is the hardest). But it is far more common for there to be a case where a criminal defendant is undeniably guilty of some crime (e.g. larceny), but where some other more serious charge (e.g. robbery or burglary) is marginal at best. Making sure that a criminal defendant is only punished for the crimes that he or she clearly did commit, and not for more serious overcharged crimes, is frequently a major issue for a criminal defense attorney defending someone who is clearly guilty of some crime."}

I had already sent a certified letter through the post office, so they really couldn't avoid acknowledgment of the letter, but as of the time of me going into the office to hand in one personally, it hadn't arrived yet (according to the tracking number). Not knowing if my twenty days was twenty days or not, and that they hadn't received my letter, I agreed to sign theirs and everything looked fine on the paperwork.However, after everything was signed, that stated that because I would still be there on the first of the month, I would need to pay the entire month's rent for April, and that after the date mentioned on the notice (April 30) that they would be able to market the apartment as available. I objected to this, stating that if I'm paying for an entire month's rent, that I have a right to be there for the entire month. They said absolutely not, as it is their right as a leasing agency in Washington to do this. I haven't been able to find anything in my research that would indicate that this is the case, but IANAL.Is there precedent for this in Washington? Do they get to double-dip in this manner? Because as written, it seems like they could have someone start their lease at the first day after what I mentioned in my noticed (May 1), and have the new tenant pay for May, after I have already paid for May.Relevant section from the leaseNOTICE TO VACATE Resident understands Washington State Law requires that to terminate residency, twenty  (20) days written notice must be given to Landlord or to Resident by Landlord prior to the end of the monthly  term. Resident agrees that if he\/she remains in possessions of said unit after date of intention to vacate, he\/she will pay a  daily rental of $75.00 thereafter.","answer":"The ), states that  When premises are rented for an indefinite time, with monthly or other  periodic rent reserved, such tenancy shall be construed to be a  tenancy from month to month, or from period to period on which rent is  payable, and shall be terminated by written notice of twenty days or  more, preceding the end of any of the months or periods of tenancy,  given by either party to the other.I assume you have a month-to-month agreement (otherwise, you would be at the end of the lease and you don't have to give notice). The law simply requires written notice, and does not require any special form or signature. The misunderstanding by the agency about what 20 days is is common enough (after all, 30-20=10). One possible cause of confusion is over whether the law is stated in terms of tenants giving notice versus landlord receiving notice. The statute is not clear on this, but the above clause says 'given by either party to the other', not 'received by either party from the other'.If it is concluded, somehow (contrary to your attorney's argument) that your notice was not sufficiently timely, one option is to simply pay the next month's rent (at whatever the agreed rate is) and not leave until the end of the next month (giving timely notice early in the month). Under that option, landlord may not re-rent or otherwise illegally enter the premise, until the end of the subsequent month. A tenant may physically stay beyond the end of the lease, without paying  this is known as ' provides  If the tenant defaults in the payment of rent and reasonably indicates  by words or actions the intention not to resume tenancy, the tenant  shall be liable for the following for such abandonment: PROVIDED, That  upon learning of such abandonment of the premises the landlord shall  make a reasonable effort to mitigate the damages resulting from such  abandonmentThe liability clause says:  When the tenancy is month-to-month, the tenant shall be liable for the  rent for the thirty days following either the date the landlord learns  of the abandonment, or the date the next regular rental payment would  have become due, whichever first occurs.There is a problem with 'the date the landlord learns of the abandonment': when (or what) exactly is 'the abandonment', and does 'learning of the abandonment' have to follow 'the abandonment'? It may be tempting to think that signalling the intent to abandon starts the clock, but . There does not appear to be any case law clarifying the meaning of 'learning of the abandonment': it would probably require expensive litigation to establish that this means 'learning of the intent to abandon', so you might as well assume that the abandonment clock starts from when you are really out of the unit. If you leave at the end of the month, indicate an intent to abandon the unit, and do not pay rent, then you will have abandoned the unit, and you will be liable for 1 month rent. However, they law also imposes an obligation to mitigate the damage, which basically means, no double-dipping.Leaving aside unlawful detainer, both the abandonment approach and the 'keep it another month' approach entail paying another month's rent. In the former case, you have no claim on the unit but they can only ding you for rent for the number of unoccupied days. In the latter case, there is no option to pay less than a month's rent, but you retain full tenant rights (they cannot enter or re-rent). In neither case is there an avenue for both keeping the full month's rent from you, and re-renting the unit."}

They made it harder for accusers to defend themselves by banning direct cross-examination of accusers and they allowed accusers to appeal not-guilty decisions.Emphasis mineThis surprised me (I let out an audible 'what the...') because what is described above seems like a clear breach of due process, guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.

Typically, they only decide whether to suspend or expel the person as a student at the university, or apply other academic punishments (failing grades, marks on transcript, etc).I don't think there needs to be any law 'affirming' this.

{"question":"I recently moved to Western Massachusetts from New Hampshire, where speed limit changes of 10+ MPH are always marked with 'reduced speed ahead' signs. According to the Massachusetts government website: 'Reduced speed limit ahead signs are used to inform road users of an impending reduced speed zone where the speed limit is typically being reduced by 10 mph or more'. There are several places along roads I drive somewhat frequently, such as the U.S. 202 highway, where the speed is reduced by 10 MPH or more with no warning signs, often right after corners so that it's impossible to see the signs with enough distance to safely slow down before passing them. For example, there any many places where the speed drops from 50 to either 40 or 35 with no warning, and even a place where it drops from either 45 or 50 (can't remember) to 25 with no warning, and from 35 to 15 in another spot, a reduction of 20-25 MPH. None of these places are marked with 'reduced speed ahead' signs, and many of them are right at the end of corners that are impossible to see around because of trees, etc. This leads me to believe that there must be some law in MA that allows drivers a certain distance to slow down after passing a speed limit sign of a lower speed without it being considered speeding, but I cannot find any information about this from my online searches. If there is no law allowing this, then are these towns breaking the law by not putting up these 'reduced speed ahead' signs when dropping the speed from say 50 to 25, or 35 to 15, with limited visibility along a U.S. highway?","answer":"When there is a road sign showing a speed limit, your speed must be reduced to the speed limit when you reach the sign.

I did not open the letters.

If the sons want to share this information between them, that's their choice.The will is a complete secret from his family until his death.","answer":"FIRST: A last will and testament does not have to be disclosed to anyone [1] prior to death.But at death, notice of the commencement of a probate proceeding which is necessary for the will to be given effect must generally be given to:(1) everyone who takes under the will, and(2) everyone who would take if either that particular version of the will were invalid and a prior will that it revokes is valid, and(3) everyone who would take if there were no valid will, and(4) creditors whose claims are accepted as valid, but are not paid due to the insolvency of the probate estate.Everyone entitled to notice of the probate of a will is entitled to see the last will and testament submitted to the court in its entirety.The case could be placed under seal to prevent people other than interested parties and their lawyers from seeing the will, but not sons of a decedent who are interested parties by definition even if they get nothing under the will, because they would take if there was no will.SECOND: This said, it is easy to make a secret transfer effective upon death via a variety of non-probate transfers such as a beneficiary designation on an account, or the provisions of a trust, that don't require a court proceedings to take effect the way that a will does (people who think that they can avoid probate by having a will are fundamentally mistaken, probate is a court proceeding necessary to give a will legal effect).Only some of these methods of making a secret gift work if the estate is subject to estate taxes which requires disclosures to be made on gift and estate tax returns of all transfers taking effect at death (something that can be circumvented by making a transfer during life that is not reportable during life because it is within some exception to gift taxation).NOTES:[1] Usually a will has to be shown to the two witnesses to a will, unless it is executed under the recently repealed Louisiana law allowing for a mystic will which has seven people witness the envelope but no one witness the will itself prior to death. Of course, holographic wills, substantially in the handwriting of the person writing them, don't have to be witnessed at all."}

{"question":"One issue that has not been conclusively decided by the courts is the constitutionality of DACA protections. For example, the Supreme Court has not ruled on whether or not DACA is constitution. Since President Obama created DACA through regulations that complied with the Administrative Procedure Act. However, the Trump administration might not have complied with this act and as a result a  have argued that DACA is itself unconstitutional. The Attorney General of Texas filed this lawsuit in a different district court from the lawsuit seeking to keep DACA.Suppose both lawsuits successfully obtained a preliminary injunction in their favor. One injunction requires the United States Federal Government to continue accepting applications for DACA relief (and if the applicant complies with procedures offer them relief from enforcement). While the other injunction requires the Federal Government to stop offering DACA protections. Suppose that both District Courts require that their orders have nationwide effect and that a stay of the injunction is not issued immediately or by the circuit court with appellate jurisdiction (and maybe the courts are in separate circuits). With the current Supreme Court standing at 8 justices, it is plausible that the justices could be split 4-4 on the issue of granting a stay.What is the legal position the Federal Government must take (assuming the Federal Government wants to comply with orders of the judicial branch as much as possible and does not assert its authority as a separate branch of the Federal Government)? Would the government be required to continue DACA or must it stop the program?Currently this has not occurred, but I imagine it is possible for this situation to occur at some later point in time or if by chance some things change in the future.","answer":"Resolving Conflicting InjunctionsThis happens from time to time, frequently in cases involving child custody with dueling cases in different states, at least until recent legislative changes (the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act), which set forth clear rules calculated to leave only one court with jurisdiction to enter orders in almost all cases. The very first case I worked on as a student in a law school clinical program involved this kind of jurisdictional standoff.There is no fool proof way to prevent this, although parties will often forcefully ask the court not to have contradictory injunctions imposed upon them, and courts will often take these arguments seriously. And, the parties will usually parse the language of each order to determine how both can be possibly be complied with at once.Also, impossibility is a defense to being held in contempt of court for violating an injunction, and this tends to favor honoring the first entered of contradictory injunctions since the first is not impossible to comply with but complying with subsequent orders may be impossible.When push comes to shove and the appeals in each case don't change the result, usually the case keeps going up the appellate court ladder on an emergency basis in each contradictory case until it the deadlock is resolved, or until a court with jurisdiction over all courts involved intervenes.But, as you note, there is no definitive way to prevent the highest court in the land from having a deadlock (which can happen even when there are an odd number of judges if a judge recuses).In many state supreme courts, and in appellate courts outside the U.S., deadlock in a tie breaker court is often avoiding by having a process to appoint lower court judges a substitute judges in a higher court when there is a potential for deadlock in that court. But, the U.S. Supreme Court has no such process.The Ongoing Policy DebateThere is on ongoing debate in federal public law practice (i.e. in cases in which the government is a party) over whether national injunctions of the type that have been issued in the DACA case and the Muslim ban cases in the current administration are proper, or not on jurisdictional grounds (but, the propriety of the injunction is generally not a defense to being held in contempt of court for violating it). These injunctions bind the United States government, which is a single entity over which the court has jurisdiction, but the dispute is over whether these injunctions should be allowed to benefit non-parties who are similarly situated to those before the court (the prevailing rule at this time), or whether the parties seeking an injunction against the United States government only have standing to obtain relief for themselves personally, in the absence of a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which has procedures calculated to protect the interests of members of a class who are not personally before the court.The conservative position is that national injunctions against the United States should not be allowed outside of class actions, which would reduce the potential risk of conflicting orders, but would allow the United States government to proceed with conduct that had already been judicially determined elsewhere in a case against the same defendant to be unacceptable and illegal conduct. The status quo of allowing national injunctions is also important to allow a court to have the power to grant relief to individuals whose current location is not known perhaps, for example, because the United States government has concealed this information.For example, a national injunction allows a district court to grant relief to a parent whose child has been removed from the parent improperly to an unknown location in the juvenile immigration detention system for which the U.S. government lost track of 1,400+ juveniles due to poor record keeping."}
{"question":"Are there any proscriptions on the custodial interrogation of people who are under the influence of alcohol or other mind-altering drugs?  If not, are there any laws that prohibit offering intoxicating substances to a person in custody?I am interested not only in the U.S. but also in other countries where coercive interrogation is prohibited.  But to offer an illustration: In the U.S. police may arrest a suspect of a crime who happens to be drunk.  If, following the Miranda warning, that suspect does not invoke the right to silence or to a lawyer is a subsequent interrogation admissible evidence in a trial?  Or, if a suspect is arrested who is not drunk: Police are supposed to provide food and water to subjects in their custody.  Is there any legal restriction on offering subjects alcohol or other intoxicants prior to or during interrogation?","answer":"SCOTUS suggests in , 372 U.S. 293, that a subject'sconfession was constitutionallyinadmissible if it was adduced by police questioning during a periodwhen petitioner's will was overborne by a drug having the propertiesof a truth serum.In , it is held thatIf the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney anda statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government todemonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived hisprivilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained orappointed counsel. Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 490, n. 14.This Court has always set high standards of proof for the waiver ofconstitutional rights, Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938), and wereassert these standards as applied to in-custody interrogation.Subsequently in , defendant suffered from psychosis that interfered with his ability to make free and rational choices and, although not preventing him from understanding his rights, motivated his confession. The court found thatCoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to finding that aconfession is not voluntary within the meaning of the Due ProcessClause. Here, the taking of respondent's statements and theiradmission into evidence constituted no violation of that Clause. Whilea defendant's mental condition may be a significant factor in thevoluntariness calculus, this does not justify a conclusionthat his mental condition, by itself and apart from its relation toofficial coercion, should ever dispose of the inquiry intoconstitutional voluntariness.In the Massachusetts case , ?443 Mass. 597, the Mass. Supreme Court (in the first ruling) said thatWe see no error in the judge's finding that the defendant's mentalinfirmities were such that she did not understand the Mirandawarnings, and we therefore conclude that statements made after theinterrogation did become custodial were properly suppressed.On remand and after in a second appear, in, 823 N.E.2d 383, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled thata finding that the defendant was unable to make a knowing, voluntary,and intelligent waiver of her Miranda rights is not enough, standingalone, to support the finding that her statements were involuntary.The court found that the defendant was competent to stand trial contrary to the trial judge's determination, and said thatbecause we are unable to determine if the judge would have allowed thesupplemental motion to suppress without the erroneous findings, wevacate the order for suppression and remand for further consideration.The point here is that being mentally disabled is not per se proof that a confession is involuntary.Turning specifically to intoxication, in , the trial court suppressed a confession while intoxicated based on its finding that Jewell was too intoxicated to knowingly and intelligently waive his right to remain silent. The Colorado Supreme Court reversed the suppression[b]ecause the facts do not support the trial court's determinationthat Jewell's intoxication was so severe that he was demonstrablyunable to knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda rightswhich leaves open the possibility that there is some such degree of intoxication. The court determined thatIntoxication only invalidates an otherwise valid Miranda waiver if thecourt finds through a preponderance of the evidence that the defendantwas incapable of understanding the nature of his rights and theramifications of waiving them.Subsequent discussion partially fleshes out how one might determine whether a waiver is unknowing or unintelligent. Citing , the court suggested consideringwhether the defendant seemed oriented to his or her surroundings andsituation; ?whether the defendant's answers were responsive andappeared to be the product of a rational thought process; ?whether thedefendant was able to appreciate the seriousness of his or herpredicament, including the possibility of being incarcerated; ?whetherthe defendant had the foresight to attempt to deceive the police inhopes of avoiding prosecution; ?whether the defendant expressedremorse for his or her actions; ?and whether the defendant expresslystated that he or she understood their rights.One issue was raised regarding cases where, as here, the intoxication is self-induced. A fundamental result of the mass of Miranda case law is that coercive actions by police invalidate a confession. Getting a suspect drunk(er) would be a clear case of a coercive police action, and presumably would be inadmissible under ."}

{"question":"My understanding is that there are two main organizational structures for a nonprofit: one with a board of directors, and the other (only possible in some US states) to have a board of directors, where the members have voting rights to elect and replace members of the board of directors. In this latter case, the members still only have indirect control. The board of directors has absolute control over the organization and could do anything they pleased with it, even against the wishes of the membership. (Correct me if I'm wrong.)Is it possible to set up a nonprofit so that the members have complete control over the organization, in decisions large and small? I realize that seems difficult logistically--I have some thoughts on that. My concern here is how to do it legally. The members should feel they have the final say over what the organization does, even more than executive officers of the company or a board of directors.Mainly, I greatly dislike the idea of a small, random group of directors being able to make decisions the membership would not want.More specifically, I have a very unusual idea: imagine, say, that each member has a certain number of votes, based on how long they have been a member, how much effort they have contributed and how far they have proceeded through the group's educational program. Imagine that the founder, or founders, has a huge number of votes. In the early days, while the organization is small, the founders would essentially have total control. As membership grows, the founders' votes would represent a smaller and smaller portion of the total votes. Eventually they would only possess a tiny percentage of the total votes. They would be influencers, in a mild way, but would have little control. By this point the membership would be large enough that there would be no realistic chance of a special interest group seizing control of the popular vote and thus, the organization. This concept seems to me to be feasible, but I don't know if there's a way to get away with it legally in a nonprofit.The most relevant post on this site would seem to be , but I'm not sure that it actually answers my questions.","answer":"I will correct you as you are wrong.The board of any organisation must act in the interests of the organisation which means acting in the interest of all of the members as a collective, in accordance with the constitution and applicable law of course.

{"question":"In Brazil, it's not uncommon for criminals to kidnap someone and coerce them to give them money from their bank accounts. This can be done by taking the victims to ATMs or even demanding a transfer via the victim's bank app, all at gunpoint!In many cases, after the victims sued, Brazilian courts ordered banks to cover all the victims' losses. The rationale is that the technology that makes this kind of crime easier is not just a convenience to bank clients, but also plays in favor of banks (for example, by reducing their staff), so banks cannot claim they are not liable.My question is: how is this matter treated in American courts?","answer":"At least for the ATM at gunpoint case, the bank is required to reimburse all but $50, provided that you report the incident promptly. defines unauthorized electronic fund transfer as an electronic fund transfer from a consumer's account initiated by a person other than the consumer without actual authority to initiate the transfer and from which the consumer receives no benefit.  And there is an official interpretation that this includes:<ol start='3'>Access device obtained through robbery or fraud. An unauthorized EFT includes a transfer initiated by a person who obtained the access device from the consumer through fraud or robbery.Forced initiation. An EFT at an ATM is an unauthorized transfer if the consumer has been induced by force to initiate the transfer.Although it's not quite in keeping with everyday usage, the context of the regulation makes it appear that transfer includes cash withdrawals.Liability rules for unauthorized transfers are in .  In summary, if the loss or theft of the access device (which I assume would be read to include a forced usage) is reported to the bank within two business days, the consumer is only liable for the first $50 of the loss; the bank must reimburse the rest.  If it is not reported within two business days, then the consumer is liable for the first $500.  The bank must credit the consumer's account, at least provisionally, within 10 business days (Section 1005.11).This rule doesn't directly address the case of forced use of a bank's online services or mobile app.  I don't know if it would be treated the same.Many banks offer zero liability fraud policies that go beyond what the law requires.

That is, it never happened and everyone needs to be returned to their original positions as far as possible.However, in general, an error by one or the other party in their understanding of what was agreed does not invalidate the contract. For example, if you told them it was a 'small' dog because it was small for a Great Dane but under an objective classification, it is, in fact, a 'large' dog the contract must be completed and either you or they wear the additional cost of doing so.Whether they are entitled to ask for additional payment 'due to some wrong information' depends on who took the risk under the contract for its correctness? Barring a specific term, the risk usually lies with the party that provided the 'wrong information' but some contract will assign the risk for one party's errors to the other party - subject to a requirement to act in good faith.If they are not entitled to additional payment, they have to perform the contract for the original fee. If they are entitled, then you have to pay a reasonable price increase - you are not generally entitled to cancel.All of this turns on the specific terms of the contract and the exact nature of the 'wrong information'.Consumer Protection LawCPL in your state or their state or both will almost certainly have something to say about this beyond common law rules of contract."}

Feel free to edit this question in order to make more sense legally. ","answer":"Section 4, Definition 4 Covered Entity, emphasis added:  The term 'covered entity' means a device manufacturer, a software manufacturer, an electronic communication service, a remote computing service, a provider of wire or electronic communication service, a provider of a remote computing service, or any person who provides a product or method to facilitate a communication or the processing or storage of data. This definition seems extremely broad, and could be stretched to cover an answerer on Stack Overflow whose answer provided a method facilitating data processing, storage, or communication (which covers most software methods).  So let's then look at what can be required of a covered entity:Section 3(a)(1), Requirement:  ... a covered entity that receives a court order from a government for information or data shall provide such information or data to such government in an intelligible format or provide technical assistance as is necessary to obtain such information or data in an intelligible format or to achieve the purpose of the court order.  Subsection 2 limits the scope so that a covered entity only has to provide data if the data was 'made unintelligible by a feature, product, or service owned, controlled, created, or provided by the covered entity or by a third party on behalf of the covered entity.'  However, courts cannot effectively require people to do the impossible; if a programmer wrote a method that was used in an encrypted communication service that does not mean the programmer, lacking the encryption key, will be forced to break what they believe to be unbreakable encryption.  The key here is in section 3(c), emphasis added:  A provider of remote computing service or electronic communication service to the public that distributes licenses for products, services, applications, or software of or by a covered entity shall ensure that any such products, services, applications, or software distributed by such person be capable of complying with subsection (a). So if this bill were to become law, it would be the service provider who's responsible for making sure the government can get the intelligible information.  The government could require e.g. the author of the encryption function, even if that person's not part of the service provider, to help break the encryption, but the responsibility for ensuring data accessibility lies with the service provider.The definition of service provider seems absent from at least what I can see of this bill, but it seems that a company selling a communications service to customers would very likely qualify, and a person\/company who posted an answer on SO that was then picked up and integrated into something someone else distributed as part of a service, very likely would not.

Or are there any cases regardless of circumstances in case law regarding quiet enjoyment that ended up in a favorable outcome for a tenant?I have had my quiet enjoyment violated a couple of times as a tenant throughout my life and yet, unless they are violating a state law in general, I don't see why quiet enjoyment is even mentioned or exists as it does not exist as de jure nor de facto.Also, if the agreement is between landlord-tenant, how does one prove the landlord is at fault for another tenant?Could you make the argument that their change in visitor policy is the problem? For example, if the new policy says, hey as long as the visitor has a permit parking pass we consider them okay to be on premises indefinitely, whereas perhaps before the policy was a visitor must register and they must be there no more than 72 hours or 3-day visit.The quiet enjoyment seems like more of a social contract, but when that social contract breaks down, either between landlord-tenant or tenant-tenant, if the circumstances are not illegal, nothing becomes of that breakdown.So my past and present experience has shown me, its quiet enjoyment violation if and when a local, property or state law has also been violated, otherwise, its your problem and civil suits are fraught as someone once said.","answer":"LotsCommercial landlord-tenant disputes are heard at first instance in the NSW Administrative Disputes Tribunal. A  of their decisions gives more than 50 hits between 1999 and 2013.Quoting from the first of these:  whether the former lessee under a retail shop lease of premises in a shopping centre is entitled to damages from the former lessor, on the ground that renovation works in the centre carried out by a building contractor employed by the lessor disrupted the business of a real estate agency carried on in the premises, in ways amounting to a breach of the lessors covenant for ??quiet enjoyment?Spoiler - the answer was yes.Residential landlord-tenant disputes are heard in the NSW Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal but only after mandatory Alternative Dispute Resolution has failed. A  gets over 400 hits.For example,  was a successful argument by a tenant that the landlord denied them quiet enjoyment. The facts of the case were that a neighbour who was a tenant of the same landlord interfered with their quiet enjoyment to the extent that required police intervention.These cases give you some idea of the things you would need to prove: that your landlord was responsible (so a neighbour who is not under your landlords control wouldnt. Similarly, a landlord can only influence a body corporate to the extent of their power within it) and the interference was egregious."}
{"question":"Can fully-clothed dry-humping someone without consent count as rape?And if not, what sort of offense is it? If found guilty, what would a typical punishment be in the US?Does it matter whether the victim is under-aged?Does it matter if the perpetrator is in a position of authority? (Say the perpetrator is a high school teacher and the victim is a high-school student.)","answer":"Most states have two parallel sets of sexual assault statutes. One set punishes sexual assaults involving sexual penetration that has greater penalties. The other set punishes sexual assaults involving sexual contact without sexual penetration that has smaller penalties but otherwise the same elements of the offense.Usually, almost every offense which is a crime when it involves sexual penetration is also a crime when it involves sexual contact but not sexual penetration, with the fairly frequent exception of statutory rape offenses that cover an adolescent victim who is below the age of consent but post-pubescent (with the statute itself setting specific age thresholds that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction).Often, even when statutory rape of an adolescent (i.e. sex with consent by an adolescent under the age of consent) itself is a relatively minor crime, often a misdemeanor, and is rarely prosecuted to the full extent of the law, child prostitution or attempted child prostitution with the same victim is often a very serious offense, and child pornography offenses often also carry serious penalties when the child is under the age of eighteen, even when the sexual act filmed or photographed itself is of people who are above the age of consent and are legally having consensual sex.In many states, sex with someone in a position of authority over the victim is a crime without regard to consent, much like a statutory rape offense, but without regard to age. In some states there would be a parallel sexual contact offense, and in some states there would not be one.The name of the offenses varies considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Sometimes they are different degrees of the same offense, sometimes they are offenses with different names, and the names used varies quite a bit.Also, even when an arguable sexual contact offense is not a sex offense, it would almost always be some form of non-sexual criminal assault offense.For example,  has sexual assault related crimes called sexual assault at Colo. Rev. Statutes \u00a7 18-3-402 (involving sexual penetration and including two grades of statutory rape, and including cases where the victim is in custody of law or detained in a hospital or other institution and the actor has supervisory or disciplinary authority over the victim and uses this position of authority to coerce the victim to submit, unless the act is incident to a lawful search and cases where the actor, while purporting to offer a medical service, engages in treatment or examination of a victim for other than a bona fide medical purpose or in a manner substantially inconsistent with reasonable medical practices), a parallel crime called unlawful sexual contact at Colo.

Statute \u00a7 18-17-101, et seq.If found guilty, what would a typical punishment be in the US?In a system in which there are several classes of felonies and several classes of misdemeanors, usually sexual contact offenses are one to three offense classes below the sexual penetration offense with the same elements.For example, if unaggravated sexual penetration without consent is the second lowest grade of felony, unaggravated sexual contact without consent is typically the lowest grade of felony or the highest grade of misdemeanor.A highly aggravated sexual assault with penetration offense is often punishable by decades in prison. An unaggravated sexual contact without consent offense may be punishable by up to six to twelve months in jail or a long period of probation. The offenses are too varied by jurisdiction and crime details to summarize easily. Aggravated rape is a death penalty offense in U.S. military justice although the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the imposition of the death penalty (at least in cases where the victim is not a child) is unconstitutional. Some states declare in their statutes that the aggravated rape of a child is a death penalty offense although the constitutionality of those statutes has not been tested in court and no one has been executed for such an offense since the death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s in the U.S.Most sex offenses in the U.S. of all types, including both sexual contact offenses, sexual penetration offenses, and even offenses involving no contact at all, such being a peeping tom, also require to convicted defendant to register as a sex offender, either for a long period of time or for life, which is a quite severe and separate punishment in addition to the incarceration and\/or fine and court costs and surcharges involved.In the case of child sex offenses and some repeat rape offenders, even after a term of incarceration is fully served, the state may seek to have the offender detained indefinitely civilly to protect the public until it is determined that the offender is no longer a threat, which rarely happens in practice."}
{"question":"My car was impounded in MD due to expired tags. I've since paid the state and county fines for this, but the county police use a private impound lot which charges exorbitant fees for storage. MD law gives county officials the right to take possession of a car for unpaid fines, and authorizes them to contract the service to a third party. However, since paying the fine, the county is no longer in possession of the vehicle, the towing company is. MD vehicle antitheft law states 'A person may not take a vehicle without the consent of the owner of the vehicle and with the intent to deprive the owner temporarily of the owner's possession of the vehicle, even if without the intent to steal the vehicle.'What exactly prevents me from using this antitheft law to regain possession of the car without paying? (I realize this argument would not hold up in court, I'm just curious about exactly why that is)","answer":"For starters, you can't 'use the antitheft law' because you are not a criminal prosecutor.I'm not sure that the criminal statute would support a civil action for , at least until you've paid all the fees that the towing company is explicitly authorized to charge and they still refuse to release the vehicle.

{"question":"I understand that, unlike United States Department of Justice lawyers, Securities and Exchange Commission lawyers are not allowed the benefit of surveillance evidence or wiretaps gathered by agencies on the same suspects during investigations. Is this the case? If so, what is the legal reason that this is the case and what policy does this serve?","answer":"The Distinction Is Probably Between Criminal And Civil EnforcementMy suspicion is that the distinction that you are picking up upon reflects of division of labor in which civil enforcement actions are mostly handled by lawyers assigned to the Securities and Exchange Commission (an independent federal government agency), while criminal securities fraud enforcement actions are mostly handled by lawyers assigned to the United States Department of Justice. But, I strongly suspect that the fundamental source of the distinction is the kind of case handled by each agency and not agency of employment per se, because constitutionally and for most purposes, SEC employees and Justice Department employees are both employees of the same entity, the federal government of the United States of America.If an SEC lawyer were loaned to the Department of Justice to work on a criminal securities fraud prosecution that the DOJ didn't have anyone qualified to prosecute due to lack of financial industry knowledge, I do not believe that the limitation that you assert exists would apply.Search Warrants, Wiretaps and Arrest Warrants Are Generally Only Available In Criminal CasesGenerally speaking, search warrants, wiretaps, and arrest warrants are investigative tools available only in criminal investigations, and in the absence of exigent circumstances, may only be issued upon a showing to a neutral magistrate or judge, supported by a sworn statement showing that probable cause exists that a crime has been committed and (1) in the case of an arrest warrant, that the person named committed that crime, and (2) in the case of a search warrant or wiretap, that the search or wiretap will reveal evidence of that crime. Exceptions To The General RuleThe main exceptions to this general rule is that arrest warrants may issue in a civil case (i) to compel the attendance of a witness who fails to make a timely response or appearance to a subpoena after being personally served in a timely manner with that subpoena, (ii) to compel someone to attend a quasi-criminal contempt of court hearing,  and (iii) to arrest someone who have been held in contempt of court. In criminal contempt proceedings, contempt of court is a crime that is just prosecuted using an unusual procedure. In the case of subpoena enforcement and civil contempt enforcement the infringement on an arrestee's right is limited in that compliance with the court's order will promptly result in the person arrested being freed. Also in subpoena and civil contempt cases the person arrested does not get a criminal record as a result (although they may get an arrest record), so there are no collateral consequences to the proceeding as there would be a criminal case.The Legal Basis For This RuleThese limitations are a function of the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution which states:  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,  and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be  violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,  supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the  place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.The implied term that 'probable cause' means probable cause that a crime has committed and that the object of the search or seizure is connected to that crime is a long standing interpretation of the 4th Amendment through case law. This interpretation has been applied and has been enforced via the exclusionary rule in federal criminal prosecutions since Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383 (1914) (the U.S. Supreme Court definitively applied the 4th Amendment exclusionary rule to state criminal prosecutions under the selective incorporation doctrine via the 14th Amendment in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961)). The meaning of probable cause, however, is even older than the exclusionary rule (before which, a civil rights action would have been the primary remedy for a violation). But, federal criminal prosecutions were extremely rare in the first 90-150 or so years of the existence of the federal government because the scope of federal government activity relative to state government activity was much smaller, and because the combined scope of all government was smaller in a less complex economy.Wire Taps Are 4th Amendment SearchesThe determination that a wiretap was a search for 4th Amendment purposes was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967).Policy ConsiderationsThe investigatory tools of search warrants, wire taps and arrest warrants, are frequently obtained ex parte and secretly (until the search, wiretap or arrest is complete), because the law considers it likely that defendants facing potentially lengthy incarceration will risk disobeying court orders and destroy evidence to avoid those consequences. In a criminal case, the assumption that the defendant is basically a law abiding person which applies in civil cases no longer holds true once probable cause has been demonstrated to an independent magistrate, even though the defendant is presumed innocent for the purpose of an ultimate trial.The policy purpose of this rule is to allow 'people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects' from government intrusions allowing them privacy, comfort and security as a basic human right. The 4th Amendment is the way that the law balances those privacy interests and the compelling interest of the state in punishing crime so as to deter people from committing crimes.Securing Evidence In Civil CasesWhat Are Civil Cases?Civil cases are case where only money judgments and injunctive awards which do not involve incarceration if obeyed are potential punishments, and are generally considered less serious than criminal charges for which incarceration and various other collateral consequences are available as punishments, for a variety of procedural purposes.Most civil cases are brought by private parties, but governmental officials, usually in regulatory agencies, can also bring civil cases.In civil cases, it is generally assumed that defendants and their lawyers, facing the limited stakes that they do, will comply with court orders and will cooperate in providing testimony and documents rather than upping the stakes to criminal obstruction of justice charges and civil spoilation of evidence charges.Obtaining Evidence In Civil CasesIn civil cases, evidence must generally be obtained voluntarily from third parties, obtained involuntarily from the parties via the disclosure and discovery process of the rules of civil procedure (which were greatly expanded around the same time that the SEC was created in connection with a major overhaul of federal civil procedure that resulted in the federal rules of civil procedure in effect with amendments today), and via subpoenas. These discovery and subpoena tools are all basically derivative of the common law trial subpoena power, and certain other powers that were vested in courts of equity, which is constitutionally recognized in federal criminal trials in the 6th Amendment which includes a right 'to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor' and applies in civil trials by tradition, court rule and statute. The SEC has statutory pre-litigation subpoena power even in the absence of a pending lawsuit between the SEC and the parties subject to the subpoena as do almost all other administrative agencies that enforce non-criminal law.Also, because of the way that the securities laws enforced by the SEC are structured, it is possible to bring civil cases and try them without any need to resort to discovery or investigatory tools, based upon complaints filed by members of the public. For example, placing a newspaper ad offering to sell shares of stock without a registration of the offering with the SEC is a civil violation which can often be pursued in a civil case with a copy of the newspaper and the documents provided to a complaining witness by the defendants. In contrast, criminal charges almost always require third party evidence of criminal intent which is rarely publicly available.Another useful tool in civil cases is that the 5th Amendment privilege against self-incrimination does not apply, so if the defendant refused to testify (perhaps claiming the 5th Amendment for fear of criminal consequences of truthful testimony) that refusal to testify can be used to infer that his testimony would have hurt him and to find civil liability."}
{"question":"I have a nonprofit that I cannot liquidate because I do not have a US credit card to pay for liquidation.

THIS IS BAD. Now, you are operating as a for-profit company in the eyes of state and Federal law. That may change a bunch of stuff for you.Generally your state's laws require that you have a bunch of stuff in your Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws that assets must be dispositioned to other nonprofits when you disband.  Losing your nonprofit status places you in the weird and serious position of those assets coming over from the nonprofit space into the profit space, which could create serious tax issues.  And the liability for those may fall through to the responsible managers of the nonprofit.  This is not an outcome you want.  Since filing a Form 990 is free, I suggest you keep doing it! It's extremely rare for the government to require a credit card.  Generally they take credit cards begrudgingly, and only because it's a practical necessity for allowing online transactions, and often only through a distant third party.  It's not their preferred M.O.  If you think the government requires a credit card, you are thinking only of the online-transaction option.  The normal, default way to handle registrations and payments to the government is by check or money order sent postal mail.  You should look into that method, and try it.  "}

{"question":"Under the Doctrine of Merger a vested or possessory life estate merges into the next vested future interest in fee simple (whether a reversion or a vested remainder) when both are held by the same person (unless they were created in the same document).Above is a quote from my property law textbook. I am confused by what it is trying to tell me. I know what a vested interest is (it is vested because the recipient is already ascertained or at least one member of the category of recipient is ascertained in the case of Vested Remainder Subject to Open) and I know that possessory is what a vested interest is guaranteed to become (unless we are talking about Vested Remainder Subject to Complete Divestment or Contingent Remainder). By next vested future interest in fee simple I assume it means a fee simple that is currently a reversionary or vested remainder interest but I am really not sure.Help me piece this together and correct me wherever I am wrong. Providing examples could also be helpful.It appears that Doctrine of Merger is something that appears in other areas of law too. I am only interested in an explanation of doctrine of merger solely within the context of the quoted material above. ","answer":"An example of the doctrine of merger in successive estates would be a case where a widow is given a life estate and a child (from a previous marriage) is given a remainder interest in a home or farm. The child purchases the life estate from the widow, thus owning both the life estate and the vested remainder interest. After the sale, the child owns the home or farm in fee simple absolute. (I've never seen this actually happen.)Merger applies any time that the owners of successive estate are the same, even if there are other owners before them or after them in succession.The doctrine of merger also applies when the same person owns a mortgage or deed of trust and the encumbered property, for example, when a secured lender buys property from the owner in a deed in lieu. Unless a contrary intent is manifested in the record, the mortgage or deed of trust and the ownership interest merge. But, this can be problematic if there is more than one mortgage on the property and, for example, the underlying ownership of the property is purchased by a second mortgage holder who would lose a right of redemption in event of a foreclosure if the interests merge. (This is a quite common fact pattern.)The doctrine of merger also applies to contiguous subdivided properties. Suppose that A owns Blackacre and B owns Redacre, which are adjacent 15 acres parcels in a state where local government approval is required to carry out a subdivision when any of the resulting parcels has less than 35 acres. If A buys Redacre from B, then Blackacre and Redacre automatically merge into a single parcel of property and local government approval must be obtained to subdivide the property if A then wants to sell Redacre to C.This kind of merger can also be relevant to cases of adverse possession. Suppose that there is a 15 year old fence between Blackacre and Redacre that is two feet past the property line into Blackacre, in a state where the adverse possession time period is 18 years. If A who owns Blackacre buys Redacre from B and then sells it to C, a month later (after obtaining local government subdivision approval), C's adverse possession period for the fence that is in a different location from the property line restarts when C takes possession, rather than tacking with the adverse possession period of B that would have taken place if C had purchased Redacre directly from B, because the property line ceased to exist when A purchased Redacre and Blackacre and Redacre merged into a single parcel. (There is a case in Colorado with this fact pattern.)Another fairly common issue is when mineral rights in property are owned by the same person as the surface rights and then the same person owns both, which results in a merger in the absence of contrary intent in the record. So, while a deed of property in which the seller only owns the surface rights that does not mention mineral interests is conveyed to a third party, that person takes only the surface rights because you can't take more than the seller owned. But, if the seller had purchased the mineral rights before conveying to a third party in a deed that doesn't mention mineral rights, then the buyer would take both the surface rights and the mineral rights, because the surface estate and mineral estate would merge by operation of law.A may avoid the merger by forming a company or trust to purchase Redacre, rather than purchasing it in A's own name. A purchase through a company or trust can also be used to avoid a merger of a mortgage and an ownership interest, or a life estate and a vested remainder interest, or mineral interests and surface rights."}

{"question":"Im a U.S. citizen, and my spouse came on a K1 visa. We married on June 1, 2020. Then my spouse got a Conditional Green Card in December 2020.We divorced in August 2021.Obviously Im not going to help my ex with removing the green card conditional status. Anyway, my spouse has this conditional green card. But Im worried. Am I on the hook because of the I-864 Affidavit of Support, and a bunch of other support my spouse documents?If my spouse applies for removing of condition, and gets a normal green card, am I going to be on the hook still? Or will her normal green card invalidate my on the hook condition?","answer":"Yes, it appears so.The ways that your obligations under an affidavit of support can be terminated are found in   There are five options:The immigrant (your ex-spouse) becomes a US citizen.The immigrant works for 40 quarters (10 years), earning enough money to be covered under Social Security during each of those quarters, and not receiving any means-tested public assistance during that time.The immigrant abandons their green card status and departs the US.The immigrant is subject to removal, but successfully applies for adjustment of status in the removal proceedings and (as part of this adjustment of status) a new affidavit of support is agreed to.The immigrant dies.The removal of the conditional status of your spouse's green card doesn't change your obligation.  The conditional green card reflects the fact that you were married to your spouse for less than two years;  and whether or not a spousal immigrant requires an affidavit of support is largely independent of how long they've been married.  In other words, if you had been married for more than two years before you came to the US, your spouse would have always had a normal green card.

The state toxicologist is directed to approvesatisfactory techniques or methods, to supervise the examination ofindividuals to ascertain their qualifications and competence toconduct such analyses, and to issue permits which shall be subject totermination or revocation at the discretion of the state toxicologist.There are other requirements regarding 15 minute prior observation. The legally required test is done in the police station by a specially trained technician, on an approved machine (the portable machine is not approved). The implied consent law also says that this test is requiredif arrested for any offense where, at the time of the arrest, thearresting officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person hadbeen driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehiclewhile under the influence of intoxicating liquorYou are not required to take the Portable Breath Test, which is optional (when you have been stopped)  it's the post-arrest evidentiary test that is obligatory, using the approved procedure. Note that failing the optional test gives probable cause for an arrest, however there can be other grounds such as failing the line-walking test. If the officer just tells you that the roadside test is mandatory, that is a defense which can be used at trial ('cuz .The other tests (often known as Standard Field Sobriety Test) are also optional, so ultimately it reduces to whether they already have probable cause, that is, if the totality of the facts and circumstances known to the officers at the time of arrest would warrant a reasonably cautious person to believe a crime has been committed. It is just not clear to me what actual circumstances distinguish mere reasonable suspicion (driving slow) from probable cause, but watery eyes, slurred speech and alcohol smell will make probable cause. I don't know if driving slow and having watery eyes is probable cause  I would think not. Dunno about smell of alcohol plus driving slow.In . The issue for SCOTUS is whether a law criminalizing refusal to submit to a breath test (but not a blood test) violates the 4th amendment: it does not."}
{"question":"Does a court have to accept evidence produced by another country if it becomes available during a trial? Let's say one trial in the U.S. starts after 1 year another country produces evidence that show that company A is not guilty. In both countries, a company B accused company A of something and used that company in both countries. Do U.S. court have to accept evidence produced by that country B even though it was produced in the middle of the trial? I keep seeing in movies that evidence must be vetted or listed before it takes place, so I am wondering if this is true or not.","answer":"Does a court have to accept evidence produced by another country if it becomes available during a trial?For a Court it is not a matter of native or foreign evidence. For a Court it is whether the evidence is admissible in law or inadmissible in law. There are Rules for deciding the whether something is really evidence.Hence, for a Court first of all it must be an evidence (may be audio, visual, document, electronic document etc.). Then it must be admissible in law e.g. it must be the primary evidence i.e., the original piece of evidence. It must not be a copy i.e., the secondary evidence. Still, if it is secondary evidence then it must conform to a legal standard e.g. authenticated by some Government officer.After the level of admissibility then the next level is reliability. Whether the evidence adduced by a party is reliable e.g. whether the will tendered in evidence is the latest will of the executant or not?If a piece of information, document, electronic document, audio or visual material produced in the Court satisfies these three conditions i.e.,Being an evidenceBeing admissible in law, andReliable as per law and factThen that can be allowed by a Court. Its foreign origin does not vitiate its evidentiary value.I am sorry, I had not quoted the precise provisions of law in support of this answer. It is because I belong to a different jurisprudential system. Exact provisions may be different."}
{"question":"I was once told on the internet that there is no actual ban on religion at government schools in the US. The issue is actually that public school teachers are considered agents of the state and are therefore expected to refrain from religious activities whilst operating in their official capacity. So children praying at schools is not illegal as long as no agents of the state (e.g. teachers) participate.I was wondering if this was accurate though?","answer":"This is roughly accurate, but there are nuances. The real US issue with teacher-led prayer is that a teacher's authority can make it effectively coercive, or seem so, even if this is not intended by the teacher. (And in the past it has often been so intended, by teachers and administrators who thought it was good for children to be required to engage in prayer.) There is no ban on a teacher praying privately.Similarly, there is no ban on private prayer by a student. Indeed such a ban (for either teacher or student) might violate the free-exercise clause of the US constitution. Of course a student should not be engaged in prayer when s\/he is supposed to be doing classwork, but there are times during the school day available for prayer.However, public, student-led prayer can also be an issue. For example, at some schools it was customary to have such public prayer at the start of football games, or school assemblies. This official designation of a moment or occasion for prayer was challenged as an endorsement of prayer by the school, and as coercive to those who did no want to participate, but might feel strong social pressure to do so.The point is that the school, as an aspect of government, and one where students are required to attend at that, should not make prayer an expected norm, resulting in singling out those who do not conform.But no US law or court decision has ever forbidden private prayer in schools by students, or indeed by teachers."}
{"question":"Some states such as Massachusetts have 2 party consent laws which restrict secret recordings by only one party, therefore, you have to ask public school officials if they consent to being recorded. The issue is they usually say no. I was wondering if it was legal to record public officials doing their job as they are employees of the public school district, which in turn is part of the state DoE? If you can record police officers while they're doing their public duty, you should be able to record public school officials during private meetings inside their offices, right?EDIT 7\/20\/18: While reading some case law, I came across this quote:The filming of government officials engaged in their duties in a  public place, including police officers performing their  responsibilities, fits comfortably within [the] principles [of the  First Amendment]. Glik, 655 F.3d at 82Not sure why no one pointed this out, but does this not give the right to record any public official in a public place (i.e public property such as school grounds)?","answer":"There are two contexts where all-party consent is not required. One is per , which allows public meetings to be recorded. There is no employment-related exception. There is a separate 'right to film government officials, including law enforcement officers, in the discharge of their duties in a public space' which the federal courts have said extend to filming police. The key is that the interaction has to be public."}
{"question":"I've been doing some research into New York Times Co. v. United States recently, and I'm a bit unclear as to what was the outcome of that case.I understand that Near v. Minnesota established that prior restraint is illegal in the United States, with certain exceptions:No one would question but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting service or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops. On similar grounds, the primary requirements of decency may be enforced against obscene publications. The security of the community life may be protected against incitements to acts of violence and the overthrow by force of orderly government. The constitutional guaranty of free speech does not 'protect a man from an injunction against uttering words that may have all the effect of force.'What I'm confused about is how New York Times Co. v. United States fits into this. As Near v. Minnesota allows for prior restraint if publishing would obstruct military secrets, was the question of the Pentagon Papers one of whether that fits into this exception, and the ruling is that it doesn't? Or was it a question of general national security, posing an additional exception to prior restraint, which the Court denied? Does the Court's ruling overrule Near v. Minnesota entirely, giving absolute Freedom of the Press (at least ahead of time), or did it reestablish the same exceptions to prior restraint?What makes this all the more confusing is that while a majority of the Justices agreed that the Times and the Post could resume publication, there's no majority opinion as to why. On the one hand, you have Justice Black declaring,The press was to serve the governed, not the governors. The Governments power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government.and likewise Justice Douglass, who writes that the First Amendmentleaves, in my view, no room for governmental restraint on the press.Their views seem to indicate that Near v. Minnesota was entirely overturned, and there's no more prior restraint.On the other hand, Justice Brennan says thatOnly governmental allegation and proof that publication must inevitably, directly, and immediately cause the occurrence of an event kindred to imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea can support even the issuance of an interim restraining order. In no event may mere conclusions be sufficient.and likewise Justice Stewart's opinion thatdisclosure of any of [the Pentagon Papers] will surely result in direct, immediate, and irreparable damage to our Nation or its people.which seem to narrow Near v. Minnesota to direct harm, rather than any resulting harm, but not entirely overturning it.So, which is it? Does New York Times Co. v. United States overturn Near v. Minnesota, or does it simply limit it?I'm further confused by Frank Snepp v. United States, where Snepp was forced to turn over all profits from his books and cease publishing further copies. Why? Didn't both Near v. Minnesota and New York Times Co. v. United States establish at least some form of revoking prior restraint? Why does it suddenly apply here?In summary: In the aftermath of the above cases, is prior restraint legal in the United States, and if so, to what extent?","answer":"  So, which is it? Does , or does it simply limit it?Neither - it affirms it.Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. specifically stated that the publication of the Pentagon papers did not fall within any of the three exemptions that Near v. Minnesota identified. These exemptions are that it reveals crucial military information, contains obscenity, or may directly incite 'acts of violence'. These are and remain the limits, however, these will be interpreted very narrowly.There was no real dissent between the justices on the veracity of the law established by Near v Minnesota, just on whether the Pentagon papers revealed crucial military information - 3 justices thought they did, 6 thought they didn't. They split on the facts, not the law."}
{"question":"What does \"may\" mean when used as a verb in a text of law in the US?For example, if the law say \"X may do Y\", is it guaranteed that X can do Y, or does that mean that perhaps the judge or whoever has the decision power will grant the X the right to do Y, but not this isn't sure at all?Actual example from   (see emphasis):(c) Disruption of continuity of residence -(1) Absence from the United States -(i) For continuous periods of between six (6) months and one (1) year.Absences from the United States for continuous periods of between six(6) months and one (1) year during the periods for which continuousresidence is required under \u00a7 316.2 (a)(3) and (a)(6) shall disruptthe continuity of such residence for purposes of this part unless theapplicant can establish otherwise to the satisfaction of the Service.This finding remains valid even if the applicant did not apply for orotherwise request a nonresident classification for tax purposes, didnot document an abandonment of lawful permanent resident status, andis still considered a lawful permanent resident under immigrationlaws. The types of documentation which may establish that theapplicant did not disrupt the continuity of his or her residence inthe United States during an extended absence include, but are notlimited to, evidence that during the absence:(A) The applicant did not terminate his or her employment in theUnited States;(B) The applicant's immediate family remained in the United States;(C) The applicant retained full access to his or her United Statesabode; or(D) The applicant did not obtain employment while abroad.In this example, if one satisfies A, B, C, or D, is one guaranteed not to disrupt the continuity of my residence for the purpose of naturalization?","answer":"May means is possible and not is necessary. The specific law does not say anything about a person doing A, B or C and it does not say that if you do one of A, B or C then something mandatorily follows. It asserts that certain types of documentation can be used as evidence supporting the proposition that the applicant did not disrupt continuous residence, but it also asserts (without giving any further hints) that other things may be used. This law does not state necessary or sufficient conditions for establishing undisrupted continuous residence. It is not hard to construct a scenario where a person moves back to their home country and ran for public office there, but failed to quit the US job. In light of compelling evidence that they actually moved back home, failure to quite your US job is not proof that you remained in the US. Proof resides in the totality of evidence, not just the admissibility of a single fact. Doing one or more of (A-D) is no guarantee of anything."}

{"question":"So in a situation where a person wins small claims court against a company, what are the steps in collecting judgement if the company doesn't want to pay? I've researched placing a lien or garnishing wages on the individual but can you do that against a company?Jurisdiction: NV, US","answer":"First, you should simply write them a letter demanding payment of the judgment. You can keep sending them demand letters updating the interest on the judgment regularly (e.g. every month) and call them demanding to be paid on a regular basis so that your claim is annoying to them.Second, you can use legal tools at your disposal. In the approximate order of the likelihood that you would resort to them and the ease of using them, these are:You can record a judgment lien against any real property it owns, if any. This must be cleared when the property is sold and hurts the credit record of the company. You can also foreclosed on the lien although doing so involve quite a bit of legal technicalities and process and may require you to assume or pay off mortgages and liens higher in priority than your own. Basically, this involves getting the right kind of proof that the judgment was entered (in Colorado one gets a transcript of judgment from the clerk, but Nevada process may vary) and recording it in the real property records of the county where the real estate owned by the company is located.You can garnish its bank accounts, if you know where the company banks, if not, you can learn this in the next step. This involves filling out a garnishment form (which may need a clerk of court's stamp) and then mailing it to the judgment-debtor and the bank (local practice might require a process server to deliver it).You can issue interrogatories or take depositions of corporate officials to have them disclose what assets and sources of income it has (pursuant to Rule of Civil Procedure 69). This is somewhat of an involved process with legal rules and forms involved but if you don't know where the company has assets, you have few other choices but to do this and it gets their attention as well. You could also hire a private investigator to try to locate the company's assets.You can obtain a writ of execution and attachment to have the sheriff seize tangible personal property belonging to the company. This involves multiple court form filings, fees, and coordination with the civil division of the sheriff's department that will often require you to post a liability bond, to hire people to carry away the property to a secure storage unit when it is seized for later auction, and for you to pay to publish notice of a sheriff's sale with a newspaper authorized to give legal notices. It may also require you to hire a locksmith and\/or some to document the assets seized and to value them in real time during the seizure.You can garnish accounts payable to the company from individuals and businesses who owe it money. The paperwork is similar to a bank account garnishment but it often doesn't go as smoothly and has to be more actively litigated since non-bank persons aren't as familiar with the process.If you learn through Step 3 that the company has transferred assets to its owners or others while insolvent without receiving reasonably equivalent value in exchange, you can sue the recipient of the assets under the fraudulent transfers act in a separate lawsuit. This is almost impossible to do successfully without a lawyer.In an extreme case (probably not justified by a small claims court judgment) you have force the judicial dissolution of the company and liquidation of its assets for failure to pay its debts in a separation lawsuit. This is almost impossible to do successfully without a lawyer.In combination with other creditors of the company who are also unpaid, you can force the company into an involuntary bankruptcy. This is almost impossible to do successfully without a lawyer.Wait for the company to go bankrupt (if this is likely) and file a claim in the bankruptcy. This involves filling out a one or two page form and filing it with the bankruptcy court.In my experience in Colorado which has similar rules on this subject, companies with real estate usually pay upon demand (especially if they have a mortgage since an unsatisfied judgment is a condition of default on most business mortgages). But, if the company owns no real estate, commencing collections actions combination of 2, 3 and 4 is usually sufficient to get the company to simply pay the judgment without having to take the processes involved to completion.This said, most of the options above involve fairly complicated paper work and procedural requirements. The average person who doesn't have a graduate degree or a business background would really struggle to do it right and there are sometimes significant fees involved.Third, you can use other methods that don't involve the legal process that involve notifying people of their non-payment of a judgment.One trick is to learn who it has major contracts like leases and large loans with, and advise them that there is an outstanding judgment against the company, which is often a condition of default under those contract that must be cured quickly.Similarly, complaining about the company's non-payment of the judgment on customer review sites and social media can work sometimes.Fourth, you can hire someone to do it for you. Often lawyers and collection agencies are more willing to collect a true money judgment from a court than they are to take on a claim that hasn't yet been reduced to judgment and will have to be litigated.So, because it is so technically difficult to enforce your legal rights without a lawyer, even if you obtained the small claims court judgment without a lawyer, it may be worth the money to hire a lawyer to collect the judgment obtained, or to turn the judgment over to a collection agency (which also hurts the company's credit record) and to pay what that costs.On a contingent fee basis, a 33%-50% contingent fee would be customary. Hourly legal fees can run from $150 to $450 per hour in Nevada for this kind of work and it would take at least several hours of work.If the judgment is too small, it may not be cost effective to hire anyone to collect it on an hourly basis, and even collection agencies may decline to take on the case on a contingent fee basis because the work required would cost them more than the fee they would obtain if they won.In the case of a small claims court judgment that isn't very large it is often not cost effective or worth your time and effort to pursue it actively."}

{"question":"Can non-US court orders against US entities be honored\/enforced in the US?Say if I sue a Californian company in a New Zealand court (which happens to assume its jurisdiction) and win some monies, would that judgment be any practicable to enforce in California?","answer":"Usually, but not always.In California, this is governed primarily by the Uniform Foreign-CountryMoney Judgments Recognition Act. .The general rule is that the judgment of a foreign court in a country with a legitimate legal system (like New Zealand), that had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject-matter, is enforceable through a summary process that does not reconsider the merits of the foreign money judgment, if the person seeking to enforce the judgment can establish those facts. See \u00a7 1716(a)-(b).But there are many exceptions to the general rule. See \u00a7\u00a7 1715(b) (taxes, fines, penalties, some domestic relations judgments), 1716(c) (seven grounds for procedural irregularities, a ground for public policy exceptions, and certain defamation judgments). Section 1717 of the Act provides for certain exceptions to the exceptions.There are also federal law exceptions in addition to those in the act, including one applicable to foreign defamation case judgments. But these laws rarely have much practical effects beyond the California statute in cases involving purely money judgments that are governed by the California statute.Injunctive and other non-monetary relief granted by a foreign court is less frequently enforceable, and when it is, is not governed by a simple, summary statutory process from this statute. Special rules apply, in particular, to foreign child custody judgments.The summary process, when there is no other pending case in California between the parties is as follows: If recognition of a foreign-country judgment is sought as an original matter, the issue of recognition shall be raised by filing an action seeking recognition of the foreign-country judgment. \u00a7 1718(a).It is legally possible to file and prosecute a case like this one pro se in California, and it is unlikely that an in person hearing would be required in a case like this one. Usually, one could prevail in motion practice or with a remotely conducted hearing (especially in the COVID era). Whether an in person evidentiary hearing was required in a case like this would depend a great deal on the nature of the defense to recognition of the foreign judgment asserted. But, the better practice would be to hire a California lawyer to handle it for you.Typically, the cost of doing so would be the filing fee, the cost of serving the judgment debtor with process, and something on the order of $1000-$3000 in legal fees. So, it would be much less expensive than a full fledged new lawsuit, but would be too expensive to be practical in the case of a small claims sized judgment in most cases."}
{"question":"I'm a freelancer and many times I simply outsource or hire a subcontractor (all ghost subcontractors) from like UpWork to do what my clients' ask from me. My clients generally do not know that I outsource my tasks, and they think that they are just simply hiring me.Obviously, if they find out, they might decide to not work with me anymore, but on the legal aspect, would this count as some sort of employee fraud? If the work I submitted to the client damaged relationships with their clients due to the lack of quality from my subcontractor, would I take legal responsibilities?Lastly, I believe this outsourcing can be deducted as business expenses when doing taxes. However, this might lead to that business expense being somewhat high. If the IRS founds out about this, would that cause any problems?","answer":"Deducting business expenses is legal. Perhaps on Money SE would know if the IRS has alarm thresholds. It is generally legal to subcontract part of a job. There can be exceptions, especially if the contract explicitly says no subcontracting, or (hopefully obviously) substituting Al Yankovic for Bruce Springsteen at a concert. There are very many business risks associated with subcontracting which are legal, which we can ignore as being too numerous. There can be licensing concerns in a business which is regulated and which requires a license (a doctor cannot subcontract an appendectomy to a mortician). You remain responsible for getting the job done, therefore if your subcontractor does not do what is supposed to be done, you can be sued and you can't say it's not my fault, I farmed that job out to Jones.In order for it to be fraud, you would have to have held out that you personally would do the job, and you knew that you would not be doing the job, also the client would have had to rely on your personal service representation."}

{"question":"It is my understanding that the First Amendment protect free speech from being prosecuted by the government: even then, there are bright lines as to what one may not utter (state secrets for example).According to :Trumps attorneys on Friday filed a motion in U.S. District Court inMiami seeking a preliminary injunction against Twitter and its CEO,Jack Dorsey. They argue that Twitter is censoring Trump in violationof his First Amendment rights, according to the motion.QUESTIONWhy would said case be given any consideration if the 1st Amendment restricts the government from censoring speech (not private organizations)?","answer":"NOLet's reread the  again:Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.What is the first word? CONGRESS. The first amendment only looks at the ability of lawmakers. But it can't stop private people from excluding you! Twitter can do what it wants and the first amendment does not apply. The Government can't compel Twitter to host speech either, because of  banning compelled speech.To the Popehat!This question is core Ken Popehat White material. He is an avid first amendment attorney and should have something to say about this... And actually, he did already talk about pretty much the very topic, but not in regards to Mr. Trump. In his Make No Law podcast  he starts with the basic idea of if people can be thrown from a website and starts out pretty clearly before dissecting the problem and explaining why:You don't have a protected legal right to be on someone's Website.Often cited that one would have a right to be on a website is Marsh v Alabama. However, that doesn't apply because Twitter is not a company town or taking duties that are usually part of the government! So the holding that Twitter might be a state actor by doing what the state does and has to abide by the constitution simply does not apply. As Ken White says (emphasis mine):Instead, the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that a private entity only engages in State Action and therefore is only subject to the First Amendment when it performs a traditional exclusive public function.Twitter is NOT doing a traditional exclusive public function. In fact, 2019 had the SCOTUS verdict in . And Ken White quotes from the Verdict (emphasis mine):Justice Brett Kavanaugh: Providing some kind of forum for speech is not an activity that only governmental entities have traditionally performed; therefore, a private entity who provides a forum for speech is not transformed by that fact alone into a state actor. After all, private property owners and private lessees often open their property for speech. Grocery stores put up community bulletin boards, comedy clubs host open mic nights.And interviewing Eric Goldman, author of  and professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, he gets this gold evaluation of the case:[...] in terms of the basic principle that private publishers arent state actors, its possible that we could read it as a 9-0 opinion.Then he discusses ... and why it fails.Now, like Marsh, [Prune Yard]'s been limited to its own facts and on several occasions the California Supreme Court has come within one vote of overturning it entirely. There is absolutely no indication that it can be extended to social media sites.He also discusses how Here is the second crucial part of Section 230 Subsection C2. It protects websites and users when they moderate content. Heres the language. No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected. What does that mean?It means what it says, that a website can delete your post or ban you if it thinks youve posted something lewd, harassing or objectionable and you cant sue them for it. Once again, this is essential to the operation of the Internet.[...]Section 230 was not passed to require sites to be neutral. To the contrary, it was passed to give websites freedom and moderating vigorously under the theory that it was better than government intervention. And yet, this idea that Section 230 requires sites to moderate in a neutral fashion has become very popular even though it has no basis in reality or law.Or, maybe you would like the more concise form from his  summarizing Section 230 (emphasis mine):Very simply put, Section 230 is the law that says that, if I post something defamatory on Twitter, the victim can sue me, but not Twitter. It also says, again put simply, that Twitter has the right to moderate stuff on its site as it sees fit. The language of Section 230 is fairly clear, for something written by Congress. There is very little controversy amongst actual courts about what it means. The legal impact of Section 230 has been well-established by courts for decades, and efforts to evade it have been consistently rejected.Or the rather clear language of the statute itself (emphasis mine):(2)Civil liabilityNo provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of(A)any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or(B)any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).Yes, reread that: [Section 230] was passed to give websites freedom and moderating vigorously under the theory that it was better than government intervention. This means: Twitter can throw you or anyone else out because of section 230 c. And NOBODY has a recourse. Not you, not Mr. Trump, not even the government! And yes, Eric Goldman agrees in that (emphasis mine):Eric Goldman: Its censorship to tell people what they cant publish and its censorship to tell people what they must publish. Those are two different sides of the same coin; theyre both ways of curbing editorial freedom. So, anything that curbs editorial freedom in my mind is censorship trying to force services to be neutral which means to subvert their editorial judgment is a form of censorship.And censorship? THAT is banned under the first amendment. Censorship is making a law that abridges the freedom of speech - and THAT is unconstitutional.Oh, and the 14th Amendment? NOT a help either. It is only about state action, not private parties. Civil Rights Act? No protection against someone for their political beliefs or use of their speech.Final Nail: Twitter TOSFinally Twitter has every right to throw you or anyone out, including and because of a contract that was agreed to by the user, which expressly includes a termination clause (emphasis mine), the TOS:We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Twitter Rules and Policies or Periscope Community Guidelines, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct, (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances.

{"question":"In sports game simulations, do real people control the ability to use their name?I am not talking about their likeness, only their name. So, for example, if there is a game that uses generic figures that do not represent specific people, but give them real player's names, does that require permission? Another example would be a sports statistics program. Imagine there is a sports statistics program or a sports betting game. Does the software designer need to get permission to use the names of real players in his program?If so, what is the specific law that controls it in the United States?","answer":"MaybeThe answer varies significantly depending on the US state. In many states such a right will be protected, and in others it will not. The exact degree if protection and the procedures to follow will also vary. But in those states which protect publicity rights, the name alone will often be protected.Oh, I should mention that news reporting of actual events is protected under the US First Amendment. Reporting the names of players in actual games, and their results does not need any permission. That would cover the sports statistics app.  It might well cover the betting app, although that would face other legal issues because of the regulation of gambling generally.To return to personality\/publicity rights:In  Charles F. Morgan wrote:The right of publicity is the right of an individual to control the use of his or her persona  for  commercial  purposes.Maryland  is  among  the  clear  minority  of  States  in  which  the  right  of  publicity  is  not  recognized  as  a  property  right  either  by  statute  or  under  the  common  law.In  1984,  the  Court  of  Appeals  of  Maryland  adopted  the  rule  that  a  person  who  appropriates  to  his  own  use  or  benefit  the  name  or  likeness  of  another may be liable for the tort of invasion of privacy.  More than twenty years later, this  remains  the  only  reported  Maryland decision  dealing  with  the  appropriation  of likeness.  In other States, the right to control the use of ones name, voice and likeness, the right of publicity, has evolved through legislation or the common law as a property right apart from invasion of privacy.The  distinction  is  an  important  one.    The  right  to  privacy  is  personal  to  the affected individual and therefore does not survive the death of the individual.  Invasion of privacy is a tort action intended to compensate a living person who is injured as the result of anothers wrongful act.  After a person dies, he or she cannot be subjected to an intrusion into his or her private life.  While the right of privacy dies with the person, the  right  of  publicity  has  evolved  as  a  property  right  that  may  be  transferable  and  capable of surviving the death of its original owner.  At least twenty-eight States have recognized  a  common  law  right  of  publicity  or  have  created  statutory  versions  of  the  right  of  publicity.In   Neal S. Dongre writes:The right of publicity has been defined as the inherent right of every human being to control the commercial use of his or her identity. ...  The right of publicity is based in state law, which create an intellectual property right that when infringed upon is a commercial tort of unfair competition.The right of publicity has been recognized by various states  by the courts through the common law, by legislatures through statute, or by both. ...  Most other states, while not recognizing the right of publicity, do recognize a cause of action based in the right of privacy which, while protecting different interests, may arise from the same factual scenarios as right of publicity cases.Eight states currently have statutory provisions on the books which encompass the right of publicity. McCarthy at Sec. 6:3. These states are: California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. Id. Ten additional states have statutes which, although labeled as privacy statutes, are worded such that they effectively encompass most of what is known as the right of publicity. Id. These states are: Indiana, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington.The leading Supreme Court decision in this area is Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., 433 U.S. 562 (1977). This case concerned a television news station that had taped and rebroadcast an entire 15 second human cannonball act performed by Zacchini.  Although the Courts holding did not turn on the Constitutionality of the right of publicity, the Court treated the cause of action as a viable one and used the term right of publicity several times throughout the opinion. This treatment by the Supreme Court led other courts to begin to recognize the common law right of publicity.There are currently eighteen states whose courts have recognized a common law right of publicity. ... Only the Nebraska and New York courts have expressly rejected a common law right of publicity, although the New York legislature later remedied this rejection by statute."}

The result is that the defendant is giving up their right to a trial and allowing the court to convict.The difference (as mentioned in the link above) is that in a no contest plea, the defendant is not required to formally allocute, or publicly admit guilt. This means that the defendant's admission is not available in a subsequent civil lawsuit for damages brought by the victim.

In most states that have a tax such as this, it's called a prepared foods tax, which is merely a tax on any food intended to be consumed immediately after purchase.The relevant document for Michigan can be found , although most states with prepared foods taxes follow the same general principles for what is considered prepared food (I live in Nebraska and our definitions for this tax are almost exactly the same).Prepared food is:food sold in a heated state or that is heated by the seller;two or more food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item, or;food sold with eating utensils provided by the seller, including knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, straws, or plates, but not including a container or packaging used to transport the food.Prepared food does not include:food that is only cut, repackaged, or pasteurized by the seller;raw eggs, fish, meat, poultry, and foods containing those raw items requiring cooking by the consumer in recommendations contained in section 3-401.11 of part 3-4 of chapter 3 of the 2001 food code published by the food and drug administration of the public health service of the department of health and human services, to prevent foodborne illness;food sold in an unheated state by weight or volume as a single item, without eating utensils, or;bakery items (including bread, rolls, buns, biscuits, bagels, croissants, pastries, doughnuts, danish, cakes, tortes, pies, tarts, muffins, bars, cookies, and tortillas) sold without eating utensils.So, regardless if an item might otherwise fall within the definition of prepared food outlined above, if that item is described in one of the exclusions to prepared food, it is not prepared food."}

{"question":"I was reading  of the differences between civil and criminal cases and they stateCivil cases usually involve private disputes between persons or  organizations. Criminal cases involve an action that is considered to  be harmful to society as a whole.Followed byIndividuals, corporations, and the federal government can also bring  civil suits in federal court claiming violations of federal statutes  or constitutional rights. For example, the federal government can sue  a hospital for overbilling Medicare and Medicaid, a violation of a  federal statute.That seems strange to me, why wouldn't stealing from the government be considered a criminal case?I suppose the answer might be, that's just the way the statute is written.  In which case, my question would be, why are some things that are wrong involving the government considered to be part of civil or criminal law?","answer":"Civil litigation involves general causes of action that are available to anyone, including both private parties and the government. Civil courts are designed primarily to provide restitution to the injured party.Criminal courts exist for governments to exercise their police powers: specific, limited authority held only by the government. The principal purposes of criminal law are...well, they're debated, but broadly speaking, it's to punish and\/or rehabilitate the criminal and deter future criminals.Because criminal conviction can result in jail time and even the death penalty, there are more stringent procedural protections accorded to criminal defendants than there are to civil defendants. So when the government's goal is to recover damages, it's easier for them to use the less burdensoome civil procedures, just the same as anyone else would.Let me give you an example. Someone steals your identity and runs up $100,000 on your credit card.You call the police, and they find someone they think is the guy. To convict him, the police must convince an entire jury panel that he did it, beyond a reasonable doubt--a high standard. He pleads the fifth, and without his testimony, the police may not succeed. If they do, he will be sent to jail, and he may also be ordered to give part or all of your money back. If the case is weak, however, the police may not want to spend their limited time on it--and that's their call, not yours. (This also applies to government agencies; only law enforcement can bring a criminal case, not any government agency.)However, you can also file a civil lawsuit. In that lawsuit, depending on the jurisdiction, you may only need to convince some of the jury--civil verdicts don't always have to be unanimous. You may even just face a judge, with no jury. And the legal standard is a 'preponderance of the evidence,' which in layman's terms just means 'more likely than not'--a much easier thing to prove. Because the Fifth Amendment doesn't apply to civil litigation, you may even be able to argue before the jury that the defendant's refusal to testify suggests he's guilty.In summary: civil lawsuits use different rules and procedures, which may make it easier to recover money (or get other civil relief, such as an injunction) in cases where that's the goal. These courts are open to anyone, including the government. But if the government wants to use its special police powers to put someone in jail or get other criminal relief, they have to use the stricter criminal rules and procedures."}

For example, the District of Columbia requires single-occupant restroom facilities in any public space (e.g., restaurants) to be gender neutral -- restrooms designed for use by one individual at a time may not have a specific gender designation with male or female signage or icons -- but does not require employers to have single-occupant restrooms instead of another type.

In the scenarios you have outlined elsewhere, an arbitration clause is to be enforced by virtue of it being a contractual matter rather than because the clause is about arbitration. A mere change of parties to a contract generally does not preclude enforcement of provisions in that contract. That is because the new party acquires the rights and obligations pursuant to the contract.Does the new policy differ based on whether we know the two parties entered in an agreement to arbitrate at some point vs. when the parties dispute the formation of an arbitration agreement in the first place?No. A dispute of whether the parties formed an arbitration agreement is moot if there is evidence --i.e., we know-- that they entered an agreement to arbitrate. But the policy itself remains the same.Enforcement of the FAA is premised on the ascertainment that the party(-ies) knew of the right [to arbitrate], just as with any other contract.Are there any instances where the courts have favored arbitration (especially in NJ), after the U.S Supreme Court ruling?That seems unlikely.

{"question":"In the United States, under what circumstances is ignorance of a law or legal principle a defense against legal action?","answer":"In general, ignorance of a law is an excuse only when the law specifically says it is.There are extreme cases where a law has been found invalid because it did not give people enough notice. Actually, only one case I know of -- , 355 U.S. 225 (1957). The city of Los Angeles passed a law making it illegal for anyone who had ever been convicted of a felony to remain in the city for five days without registering as a felon. Lambert was arrested on suspicion of doing something else, but convicted for being an unregistered felon. The Supreme Court held that it was a violation of Lambert's due process rights to convict her of a crime she had no way of knowing about, or even suspecting. This is a very rare, extreme case, and does not apply to things where people might be expected to suspect that there might be a law.Otherwise, notice of a law is only required if the statute says so; for example, if a speed limit law requires the posting of signs, but the signs aren't posted, the law may not be in effect.

Instead, as a German business, you would be responsible to forward VAT to your local tax authorities directly, with Google not being involved. The applicable VAT regulations here in case you would be a German business would be EU directives related to VAT reverse charge procedures and they would apply because the Google legal entity with which you would be contracting would be a EU entity, namely Google Ireland Limited, according to the . Practically, the EU VAT reverse charge rules would relieve Google from VAT accounting and administration. It follows that if you only want to try out the API and no actual payments will be made to Google from you, you would be fine. However, if Google will charge you for API use, they say by this clause that it is your responsibility to report VAT to German authorities. As you couldn't do that if acting as private person, Google would be responsible and could be in trouble if German authorities would investigate. In the end, by this clause they state that you'd be liable towards them if they actually run into such trouble.So, technically it is not illegal to use the API for non-commercial purposes but you would commit a breach of the agreement between Google and you that could lead, at least in theory, to a liability of you towards Google if German tax authorities would ask Google to pay the VAT you were supposed to pay."}

In a negligence   case neither the burden of precautions nor the probability and magni-   tude of the accident that will occur if the precautions are not taken may   be quantified or even quantifiable, yet it may be apparent that there isa   grave risk of a serious accident that could easily be averted (negligence),   or that the cost of the precautions would be disproportionate to the   slight risk of a minor accident (no negligence). That is the 'tolerable   windows' approach that I advocated in chapter 9. But the key terms in   Breyers test, such as 'impact upon the publicS confidence in, and ability   to communicate through, the electoral process' and the 'importance' of   a challenged law's 'electoral and speech-related benefits,' are so nebu-   Ious that they cannot be weighed against each other at all. High-level ab-   stractions such as 'democracy' and 'active liberty' can be arrayed with   equal plausibility on either side of constitutional questions. They are   makeweights. A decision invalidating a statute on constitutional grounds   may seem undemocratic, but even if it is not a democracy-enhancing de-   cision (as reapportionment decisions are widely thought to be) it can be   defended as an application of the 'higher democracy' embodied in the   Constitution. So originalists are democrats along with loose construc-   uonjsts. Likewise federalists. who want to honor the democratic choices   made at the state and local levels, and nationalists who want to honor   the democratic chojces made at the federal level.  yields nothing.","answer":"First, I dont believe the author is using quotation marks to indicate an actual quotation, it is being used for emphasis and to group the words as a concept.That concept is that while it may seem undemocratic for a judge to overturn a law enacted by a democratically elected assembly, the higher democracy is that it protects the democratic institutions themselves by limiting the power of the legislature to what the higher law of a constitution allows."}

That's 3,539 recorded citations that go to articles in the journal on average per year. Assuming that this is about a tenth of the total output of all physics journals, this puts the total number of articles published by physicists on the scale of 35,000 per year. That is a somewhat manageable number created by a tight-knit community of very interlinked people. One might call their peer review process somewhat incestuous, but it allows one to make rough estimates on the total output.On the other hand, the  currently has about 350,000 cases filed. That's two orders of magnitude more than the impact factor of the New Journal of Physics for New York alone, and that only accounts for the tip of the iceberg of cases that get filed in New York, as Justia does not list all cases: it only takes federal cases. If you file in a lower court, it doesn't pop up there. It also only accounts very few cases before 2000 (in fact, the first 1999 case is on page 35,225 of 35,260). However, most cases start in the lower courts and stay in lower courts.Traffic violations rarely leave the queue upwards, and small claims court is supposed to run down cases like clockwork and never to leave the low halls. In NYC, it's supposed to  Assuming only one judge holds small claims for each of the two blocks and stays on the bench for about 3.5 hours, that'd be 24 cases a day per court per day, giving us a conservative estimate of at least 6,000 cases handled in a year per court. There are 11 of these courts in New York City alone, so the city alone produces about twice the output in small claims court cases as our estimate of total physics articles published in a year. And that's only the not noteworthy (and badly documented) level of small claims.Now, back to the problem at hand: New York State has (on Justia) a docket that has, in total, an order of magnitude more cases as there are articles written in physics. That is a number that could potentially be skimmed by a supercomputer and checked for references to other cases. However, we have not just the New York State court, but we also have any other state courts. In total, there are 13 Circuits and SCOTUS to skim, though the last one has heard only 993 cases between October 2007 and October 2020, which incidentally is neglectable for the number of cases to review, even if these cases have a massively higher impact. However, our numbers rapidly rise in the sum up. Taking just the cases by the circuits from  (which by far isn't complete, as pointed out above):1st Circuit, ~1350002nd Circuit, ~4400003rd Circuit, ~6150004th Circuit, ~4800005th Circuit, ~7050006th Circuit, ~4550007th Circuit, ~3800008th Circuit, ~2950009th Circuit, ~92500010th Circuit, ~20500011th Circuit, ~800000DC Circuit, ~60000Federal Circuit, ~35000That's a total of something in the ballpark of 5,530,000 cases, just in these dockets. And that is by far not the total size of all the dockets, as those are, as mentioned above, just cases that are tried in the higher courts.So, is it possible to do such a meta analysis, looking only for... let's say SCOTUS citations? No. Even assuming that we have only 993 SCOTUS cases that are citable and we only check the cases currently on Justia, we'd still review the complete filings of over five and a half million cases for any reference to any of them! The final decisions of some cases are some 150 pages long, some docket entries contain hundreds of entries, orders and documents, some contain even complete contracts as attached documents. This makes it almost impossible to make even a rough estimate of how many files would need to be sifted to sort these 993 cases by their relevancy  and that does totally ignore landmark cases that are not SCOTUS cases such as ).All in all, it would take Watson and a lot of time to go on this project and it might take years."}
{"question":"I'm Plaintiff in Small Claims Court case in Ontario Canada. Defendant filed Defence. So  Settlement Conference coming up! I read What is the Right to Silence?In the Canadian legal tradition, the right to silence is a subset of the larger principle against self-incrimination. It is closely related to the rules governing confessions and is also enshrined under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.At its most basic, the right to silence means that absent any legal obligation to the contrary, no one is obliged to speak to the police or respond to police questioning1. For accused or detained people, this is a Constitutionally protected right. The right to silence means that a detainee has the right to choose whether or not to speak or give a statement to the police2. Regardless of what the police might say, an accused person has absolutely no obligation to assist the State with an investigation or prosecution.In my honest opinion, Defendant's lawyer lied some parts of Defence. I looked up Defendant's lawyer at Law Society of Ontario website, and his record and history are not clean. I don't want him or public know my employment or what I do everyday. I know people have falsely accused at workplace or like debt collectors, harass you at work or employer.","answer":"You're only required to show up for a settlement conference.  You're not required to do or say anything at the conference.  Nothing you say or do or fail to say or do can be used at trial, and every that happens there is kept strictly confidential.  The judge is there just to give advice to both parties and for procedural reasons.  The judge will not order you to respond to any questions the defence may have.From  by the Superior Court of Justice, Office of the Chief Justice:<ol start='2'>A settlement conference is an informal, confidential meeting between the parties in the presence of a judicial officer (a judge or deputy judge).  The judicial officer at your settlement conference will not be the judge at your trial.<ol start='5'>You may feel free to discuss your case openly at your settlement conference. What you say cannot be repeated at trial. Your discussions at a settlement conference are strictly confidential, and will remain so. Unless you consent, the matters discussed at the settlement conference, and during any negotiations, shall not be disclosed to anyone. You must never mention the settlement conference during the actual trial.Note that normally there is no discovery process in Ontario Small Claims Court, but there is one exception.  The judge at a settlement conference can make an order requiring you to produce documents, but this will only be for documents that you yourself would want to provide as evidence at trial and have failed to provide to the defence as required before the settlement conference.

{"question":"Here is a fictional story based on .Andrey is a Russian programmer residing in Germany who makes regular wire transfers to his father, Boris, who resides in Russia. Chris & Dasha, a married couple, also reside in Germany. Dasha is Russian and would like to wire money from her Russian bank account to her husband's German bank account.Pictorially, we have two international transfers.However, if Andrey and Chris became acquainted, we could have two intranational transfers instead, as depicted below. Boris and Chris would receive the same amounts as before.Would this be legal? I am interested not only in the pair of jurisdictions Germany-Russia, but also UK-Russia, US-Russia, or X-Y in which jurisdictions X and Y are chosen so that this thought experiment is interesting (in some sense).Some thoughts and other (subsequent) questions:If Andrey and Chris do know each other, Andrey's transfer to Chris can perhaps be viewed as a donation to an acquaintance. However, Dasha does not know Boris. Could her transfer be viewed as a donation as well?If Andrey and Chris do not know each other but only know of each other, Andrey's transfer to Chris is somewhat equivalent to Dasha's transfer to Boris, though subject to the laws of Germany.It certainly is not the case that these intranational transfers are payment for goods or services. If they cannot be viewed as donations either, could they be viewed as money laundering?","answer":"Would this be legal?Probably at this scale. Not necessarily extrapolated to a large commercial operation involving more parties.At some point it becomes a payment system and a financial enterprise that becomes subject to financial regulation.Could her transfer be viewed as a donation as well?This is not a donation transaction and efforts to characterize it in that fashion would probably be disregarded by authorities.Could they be viewed as money laundering?The core element of money laundering is an effort to conceal the source of the funds for some purpose. It isn't clear if that would or would not be a motive.Other considerationsA fairly common way to handle this kind of situation that is similar to what you suggest is called correspondent banking. Each side has an account in Russia and an account in Germany. Most day to day transfers happen by directing that money go from one German account to another German account, or from one Russian account to another Russian account.The big benefit of correspondent banking, aside from being transparent, is that it avoids currency exchange risks, fees and considerations for small, ordinary transactions.Of course, it simply isn't difficult or expensive to simply wire money from Russia to Germany, and vice versa, now and then. There are not strict currency controls, although there are some potential disclosure requirements. One reason for you, or authorities to worry about characterization of the transactions as money laundering is that if you have nothing to hide, simple wire transfers would be the usual and ordinary way of handling matters."}
{"question":"I recently created a browser extension that allows you to pretty-format a web page and save it in various formats (Word, PDF, etc). I have made it publicly accessible through the browser extension gallery, so anyone can install and use it. The way this extension works is it uploads the content of the page you are viewing to my own server, the server processes it, and then lets you download the resulting file.This all works fine, but I recently started getting questions from users concerned about the fact that their data (possibly private and sensitive) gets uploaded to the internet. They were asking me to provide a GDPR-compliant data processing agreement, so they can install it on their company's computers.I do not have any kind of agreements, and in fact I do not even own a company at all. This browser extension, and the server that it uploads the data to is all my personal effort, and I never bothered to do any legal work around it.In this case, am I legally obliged to create a company and have any data processing agreements in place? (not sure if it matters, but I live in the UK, and I rent my server in the USA)","answer":"No, you're not required to sign any contracts. But since you're offering a service, you do have to manage some compliance tasks.You are a data controller under the UK GDPR, regardless of whether you have a company. This brings with it various compliance requirements. For example, you MUST post a privacy notice in accordance with Art 13 GDPR that explains how you process user's information. You must sign data processing agreements with your data processors, such as your server providers. And you should reconsider transfers of data to the US, since such transfers are illegal or at least quite questionable in the wake of the 2020 Schrems II ruling.You now have prospective users that are asking you for an Art 28 data processing agreement (DPA). These are likely other organizations that are data controllers of their own. For them to use your browser extension, they either need to find a legal basis that allows them to share their user's\/employee's data with you (controller to controller transfer), or they need you to act as their data processor (controller to processor transfer). The third alternative is not to use your plugin at all. Of these, a C2P arrangement is most convenient for these other orgs, but involves a bit of paperwork to set up first.If you want to act as their processor, this doesn't mean you'd have to create a company (though a corporation might be very desirable as a liability shield). Being a processor means that you're contractually bound to only use the personal data as instructed by the controller, and not for your own purposes. This restricts what you can do, and has some special compliance requirements. For example, you cannot engage new subprocessors without your controller's approval. However, processor status can also be convenient for you because you're not responsible for interacting with the controller's data subjects, e.g. you're not responsible for handling their data subject access requests.Note that it's possible to simultaneously be a controller for some users, and a processor for others. E.g. Google Docs is offered directly to users as a B2C product so that Google is a controller, but also as a B2B product as Google Workspace, where Google acts as a data processor.Personally, I'd rather not sign any contracts unless I'm doing it as a business, and adequately compensated for providing this service. GDPR is only one compliance aspect out of many, making it unwise to offer a SaaS product as a hobby. For example, copying other people's web content has copyright implications\u2026A potential alternative for some of the organizations asking you might be to make it possible for them to self-host your backend, so that they are not required to rely on you as a data processor. If you have no plans to commercialize your software, making it Open Source could be a solution. But you're in no way required to do that if you don't want to."}
{"question":"Psychiatric doctrine asserts entitlement to incarcerate someone on grounds of the bogeymen of suicidal and homicidal ideations. This is arguably a bit rich, because suicide and homicide are both criminally illegal so here psychiatric industry is arguably sidestepping criminal due process rights. But to dig into a bit more detail while committing suicide and committing homicide are both crimes, and threatening homicide is almost certainly a crime in majority if not all jurisdictions, what about merely threatening suicide without following through?","answer":"suicide and homicide are both criminally illegalThis is incorrect: according to the LII article  :Suicide is no longer considered a crime in the United States; however, some states have attempted suicide listed as a crime in their criminal statutes. On the other hand, assisted suicide (when someone helps another to commit suicide) is a crime in all U.S. states, with physician-assisted suicide being an exception to this rule in some states.The Wikipedia article  confirms this.detention and involuntary commitment for treatment of those thought likely to commit suicide is not based on criminality, and is not supposed to be a punishment. Rather it is based on preventing them from harming their own best interests. At least, that is the legal theory. And such persons do have due process rights, and can bring an action.In the case of  the US Supreme Court majority opinion stated:A finding of mental illness alone cannot justify a State's locking a person up against his will and keeping him indefinitely in simple custodial confinement. Assuming that that term can be given a reasonably precise content and that the mentally ill can be identified with reasonable accuracy, there is still no constitutional basis for confining such persons involuntarily if they are dangerous to no one and can live safely in freedom.The court in that case specifically declined to decide whether a state might confine a person adjudges dangerous to himself."}

{"question":"Red Team: Adversary Simulation. A team of penetration testers (a red team) is hired to legally break into a facility to test its security.Since the job of Red Teaming and Penetration Testing, especially physical, which is the focus of this question, involves a lot of traveling, it's hard to pin point a country to apply this question to. If it's absolutely necessary, let's assume US and European laws.Hypothetical Situation:The company Blue hires the company Red to do a Red Team engagement on Blue. Here, I'll be discussing only the physical part of the engagement, not social and cyber.Red successfully infiltrates Blue and gives detailed reports of what was done in the engagement. Example part of the report:...In building A:At door A101, we picked the lock. Techniques used in picking: Raking, Bump Key.At door A102, we picked the lock. Techniques used in picking: Raking....The report includes details of techniques used to exploit and infiltrate.A week after the engagement is done, Blue is attacked by real criminals and had their data exfiltrated from building A. They didn't have camera footage of every door exploited. Installation of the doors and locks in building A are confirmed to be proper and most likely picked. However, those doors\/locks have also been reported to be picked by Red during their engagement the week before.The problem:The locks being tested have been picked and exploited by both Red and the criminals. Forensics evidence would likely show traces of both or just Red's engagement. Since red team engagements are to simulate real criminals as accurately as possible, it's hard to differentiate between evidence left by Red and those left by the criminals.Blue is highly confident that those locks were picked by the criminals, and let's assume they're correct about that. Blue wishes to investigate how exactly the criminals got in and track down those criminals. Additionally, Blue also wants to claim insurance for those locks being picked. (I've heard we can get insurance from the lock manufacturer if the locks are picked and we take damage from that)Question(s):How can forensic evident on the locks be used in court (for insurance) and investigation? How should Blue use said forensic evidence to claim their insurance and track down the criminals when it's hard to distinguish between marks left by Red and the criminals?","answer":"It's not really a legal question, but a question of evidence. For an insurance claim, you usually have to show evidence of damage to the company. The damage is likely easy to show, but you'd also have to show evidence that you didn't do it yourself. 'I didn't do it because that would be criminal' is often enough evidence. In your situation the insurance might want evidence that it wasn't the invited 'red team' that caused the damage. Worst case, you end up in civil court suing your insurance company, and there you have to demonstrate to a judge that it is more likely that the damage was caused by some criminals than being caused by your 'red team'. How you prove that is up to you. You also need to check your contract with the insurance, in case that inviting the 'red team' somehow invalidated your insurance. "}

{"question":"First, is it legal to use profane language in school (specifically a high school in California, United States)?Also, what is the maximum punishment allowed for a student using profanity (assume the worst case)?Note: I am not looking for answers about the First Amendment and what should or should not be allowed.","answer":"The First Amendment is absolutely relevant to the question (in a public school which is subject to the First Amendment, because it is a governmental entity), although it isn't the end of the story.Generally speaking, a school can establish reasonable rules and regulations for its students and punish those violations with punishments such as detentions, suspensions, expulsions, changes in grades on assignments or in classes, denial of eligibility to participate in extra-curricular activities or to receive school honors, and similar sanctions.Generally speaking, violations of school rules cannot result in criminal punishments or civil liability not authorized by other laws, and profanity is something that cannot be prohibited  at least in cases involving adults.Minors have First Amendment rights to express opinions, although they are diminished in a school setting, and while literally speaking profanity is part of the content of speech, it is often analyzed as a permissible time, place or manner restriction instead, especially when minors are present.Profanity also covers a range of conduct.Schools have the greatest authority to regulate speech when it is disruptive to the orderly operations of the school, or threatening. Profanity used to provoke or threaten someone, such as the use of a racial slur or an offensive statement about someone's family, could potentially be punished severely based not simply on what was said but because it is part of a larger context of aggression.In contrast, schools might potentially exceed their legal authority to prohibit profanity defined in such a way as to prevent students from a particularly ethnicity from speaking in ordinary non-provocative terms to each other.The N-word directed at an African-American student in a predominantly Hispanic school by someone reputed to be a gang leader with an intent to provoke or threaten the African-American students would be well within the school's right to prohibit and punish severely.But punishing two African-American students who are friends for using the same word in a friendly context like Hey, N- how you doing? I'm doing better than fine, N- might even be construed as discriminatory if punished, and deemed to be beyond the authority of the school to prohibit at all, or with anything more than the most minimal sanction.Limitations on profanity are also more suspect from a First Amendment perspective when used in connection with conduct that is intended to be expressive, such as an art project, or a monologue chosen for a drama class from published stage plays, novels and poems, or when used in connection with protests and political activity.Often the standard by which school officials are judged in court when a school punishment for some conduct or another is challenged, is whether the school officials abused their discretion and part of that analysis is proportionality.A school official can be comfortable that issuing a detention to a student, or assigning the student to some undesirable task like picking up litter from a school yard during recess for saying something like shit or fuck will not be judged to be an abuse of discretion. But, a court might very well overturn a school's exercise of its discretion to punish a student if a student were expelled for saying something like that in a manner that was not part of a more pervasive pattern of disregard for authority and disruptive behavior.Another factor that influences whether a rule like a ban on profanity is an abuse of discretion to punish in a particular manner is the extent to which there was advanced notice that this was prohibited.If the school has a clear rule that is familiar to everyone in the student body stating in advance what is prohibited and what punishments are authorized under particular circumstances, that rule is more likely to be held not to constitute an abuse of discretion, than a severe punishment of a student who has no real advanced warning that the conduct is not allowed.Similarly, the intent of the student is relevant. If a student uses profanity or an offensive term (e.g. fag) not knowing that it is considered profane or offensive, either out of ignorance perhaps because other students misled him or her about what a word meant, anything more than a minimal punishment would be an abuse of discretion, while even relatively minor use of profanity, calculated and intended to have great negative effects in the context in which it was used, resulting in a severe punishment, might not be an abuse of discretion.In between, and perhaps justifying only an intermediate punishment, at most, without constituting an abuse of discretion, would be a use of profanity that isn't naive or innocent, but isn't calculated for maximum negative effect either, and just pops out based upon what is normal in a student's home life or previous experience even though it is contrary to the norms of this particular school and the student would have realized that upon further reflection.Is there detailed case law or a statute that spells this out, in great detail? No. Some of this is embedded in custom and social norms that are familiar to judges (usually in the context of what was historically known as a certiorari petition arising from a local government quasi-judicial decision). But, I do think that this answer relatively accurately captures how a seemingly vague abuse of discretion review standard for school disciplinary actions for students would be likely to play out in real life, and those expectations absolutely do influence how school administrators and teachers impose discipline, in practice."}

Overthrowing the government or even the Constitution need not use violence. Every four-year election cycle could theoretically overthrow the whole government, and every Constitutional Amendment partially overthrows the prior state of the Constitution.For example, there is are perfectly legal manners of overthrowing an incumbent elected official, such as elections, impeachments, convictions (for those who do not enjoy immunity while in office), and recalls. Doing so to all elected members of the government simultaneously would be perfectly legal, although difficult to achieve.Likewise, there is no limit to the scope of a constitutional amendment; thus a constitutional amendment can overthrow the entire constitution, in the same way that the 3\/5ths clause was overthrown by the 13th amendment, or how the 18th amendment overthrew the limitations of federal regulation of intrastate commerce, production and sale, with regards to alcohol, only to be overthrown in turn by the 21st amendment."}
{"question":"A while back, a friend of mine did a dumb: she gave her savings to some guy in return for a vague contract to invest it for high returns.  This wasn't an Internet\/email thing; she knew this guy in real life (before COVID-19).  The guy led her to believe that he was registered financial advisor (though I didn't find anything to that effect in her contract or their message history).  Then she had some bad luck: lost her job, wrecked her car, etc.  So she wanted to dip into her savings.  She contacted the guy, who agreed to start disbursements from her investments (which he claimed to have a value of several times the principal at that point; he gave an approximate dollar figure).  He paid out a couple thousand, then started delaying, temporizing, and making excuses.  After a while of this, she started asking for all of her funds to be returned.  She continued regularly asking him for her money over the next number of months and this behaviour continued.No doubt about it: my friend's trust in this guy was unwise.  But that's not the point here.  The point here is that buried in their message history, after several months of requests from her for money and excuses from him, he asked for another $2,000 to cover \"fees\" and expedite the process of returning her money.  (She didn't pay.)  From my viewpoint, this appears to jump from some sort of confidence fraud straight into 419 scam territory.  Is this a felony?Both parties here live in the US state of Washington.","answer":"Fraud may be a crime, or a tort (civil wrong): only criminal fraud can be a felony. The Washington criminal laws about fraud are , and they are all fairly specific, such as selling or destroying encumbered property (which is a misdemeanor anyhow), or conducting a mock auction. Most frauds are misdemeanors, though forgeries are in the felony category. It also includes identity thefts, again the emphasis being on false documents. Based on your description, this is not a crime, it is a civil wrong, meaning that she will have to sue the guy to get her money back. The Attorney General's office will not get involved unless there is a widespread state interest (for example, very many Washington residents being victimized), and then the involvement would be suing on behalf of the victims.That said, if the swindle was carried out by phone, then that is potentially a violation of a federal felony law, . It would not matter if the parties are in the same state, because phone service counts as interstate commerce. So the details of phone involvement matter. Saying that you have to charge for processing a refund is not per se fraudulent and texting someone that I'll have to charge an extra $2,000 doesn't make this wire fraud. But there is some potential for a federal wire fraud angle."}
{"question":"I have a course question that involves an employer whose employee is injured by a third person. Knowing that some businesses can suffer great losses with the injury or death of an employee, I Google searched (excuse me, I have not taken a legal research course yet) for cases in which employers sought recovery for the loss of an employee. I found the latin phrase from common law 'Actio per quod servitium amisit' which means something like 'whereby he lost the service' (of a servant, for example), but this does not appear to be used in U.S. law. There are some  that reference it, but they are a bit too much for me to pick apart right now. My question is whether or not there is a current action similar to this one or whether, in general or under what circumstances, an employer can recover for the loss of an employee, under U.S. law.  ","answer":"  Recovery for loss of employee: Actio per quod servitium amisit?That theory is obsolete in U.S. law. See :  the action was based on the outdated social concept that domestic  servants were the property of their masters, id., and the assertion of  such claims has long since been abandoned.The court in National also suggests that the remedy for a plaintiff-employer's losses (akin to the ones you mention) would be available rather through a theory of tortious interference with business relation:  Plaintiff has made no allegation that Defendants intentionally and  improperly interfered with these contractual relations reaches a similar conclusion, further reflecting that recovery under [plaintiff's] theory [of per quod servitium amisit] has been almost universally denied.  I have not taken a legal research course yetFrom personal experience, I can tell you that you need no such course.For other cases regarding actions per quod servitium amisit, see the results this  (leagle.com is a free and very useful resource for legal research)."}
{"question":"I recently saw a  featuring a man interviewing Jordan Peterson and they were discussing the legality of calling someone by racial slurs, specifically the N-word. Seemingly having actually to do with the legality of calling transpeople by their deadnames or old pronouns. Peterson was not suggesting at all that it is OK to call a black person the N-word, but that he simply stating that it is not illegal in the US.Host: For example, if a black guy said \"Hey, I'm black.\" You can just say no, you're not, and then can you use racial epithets, or what he considers to be racial epithets?...Peterson: Can I? Of course I can.

When, if ever, would calling a black person the N-word not be covered under free speech? I'm guessing it varies from state to state, but I'm not certain.","answer":"Freedom of speech flows from the constitution so it is fundamentally a federal topic. Name calling is very legal unless it rises to slander.I suppose combined with other activities it can be a component of harassment and also can be used as evidence that an actual crime like assault was done with racial malice therefore constituting a hate crime.But just calling someone a racial slur is protected as free speech."}
{"question":"Police have to search and seize your documentation in order to successfully execute a traffic stop.  Isn't this a violation of the 4th Amendment?","answer":"The fourth amendment does apply to traffic stops.In general, they are a violation of the fourth amendment in the absence of reasonable suspicion or probable cause.  Even then, there are some circumstances in which suspicionless stops are acceptable to the Supreme Court, most notably in roadblock-style checkpoints for enforcing sobriety or immigration.  See, for example:Michigan Department of State Police v. Sitz ()United States v. Martinez-Fuerte ()Most traffic stops, however, occur after an officer observes a traffic violation.  This gives the officer the necessary justification to detain the motorist.  Wikipedia says:  A brief, non-custodial traffic stop is considered a 'seizure' for the purposes of the 4th Amendment and must therefore be supported by reasonable suspicion or probable cause.(Source: )Also:  In constitutional law in the United States, a traffic stop is considered to be a subset of the Terry stop; the standard set by the United States Supreme Court in Terry v. Ohio regarding temporary detentions requires only reasonable suspicion that a crime has occurred or is about to occur.(Source: )You can also read more about Terry v. Ohio .You may disagree with the Supreme Court on the question of whether suspicionless sobriety or immigration checkpoints should be allowed under the fourth amendment, but the way the system works, such stops are allowed under the fourth amendment simply because the Supreme Court has said so."}

{"question":"On youtube, can i do the following whilst collecting ad revenue?Teach someone to play a copyrighted song on guitar (i.e. ed sheeran)?Is this an infringement of copyright? I have found some research that suggests it may be ok:The NMPA  seem to enforce artist copyright rights. It appears Youtube have an agreement with NPMA to royalty share ","answer":"In order to answer your question we have to parse out an exact meaning for the individual fragments of the question: 'Teach someone to play a copyrighted song'What do we mean by 'teach someone' here? YouTube is a public medium unless you're using some unlisted videos or have some kind of external website where you are using YouTube strictly as a video hosting service. There is no one-on-one teacher-to-student interaction here outside of the possibility of some post-facto comments about the video.Is it more apt to say 'publish an educational demonstration for ad revenue' for this part of your question?Now we can evaluate the second part of your question, '[Teach someone] to play a copyrighted song on guitar?'Are you teaching guitarists what the notes of the song (the score) are or are you teaching them specific guitar techniques?In complaints responsible for taking guitar tablature sites offline NMPA President David Israelite asserted that '[u]nauthorised use of lyrics and tablature deprives the songwriter of the ability to make a living and is no different than stealing.' While you are adding your own educational value by demonstrating specific instructional techniques you are also putting the songwriter's score out in a published and public format outside of their control and earning ad revenue in the process.The 2011 NMPA royalty sharing agreement you linked to was just one settlement as part of ongoing litigation between the groupswith the most recent being a large settlement related to revenues related to 'cover songs'. In no way does the existence of such a settlement mean that you aren't still expected to obtain permission or seek agreeable revenue sharing terms for use of any material.Guitar instructors have been getting paid to teach their students to play copyrighted songs on guitar for decades but the difference here is that you are seeking to publish videos of yourself playing the artists' content and getting paid for people to watch them.Opinion: While I've learned a lot from these types of instructional videos myself and would love to make a 'fair use' argument for you here I think it would still require you to make an effort in good faith to seek permission to use an artist's content. For artists within the mainstream music industry this may be practically impossible for you as an individual to negotiate but you could have luck with more progressive artists who are working on the digital frontiers outside of the industry."}
{"question":"I just completed the Nolo Quicken Willmaker.  It prints the following notification\/warning:You're done making your trust document. Congratulations!Your living trust is not yet effective, however.To make your living trust effective, you MUST transfer ownership of the property you listed so that it is legally held in your trust. Until you do this, your trust document has no effect on your property. Transfer the property as soon as possible after you print and sign your trust document.  Learn more about Transferring Property Into Your Trust on Nolo.com.I really do not want to transfer ownership of the properties into a Trust. That is a major major paperwork headache for the properties.  There must be a simpler way that allows me to retain ownership of the property while making official the intentions that the Living Trust contains.What are my options here?","answer":"TL;DNR: Yes, you need to talk to an attorney. By definition, a trust owns property, which it manages for the benefit of others. (In legal jargon, the property is held in trust for the beneficiaries.) So no, you can't have a trust without transferring ownership. Three other ways you can transfer property after you die:1) Will: The most common way to transfer your property to your heirs after you die is through a will. A will is all about carrying out your wishes: It's called your 'last will' because it tells your heirs your will as to what to do with your property after you die. Because you get to keep your property, the only paperwork you need to do is writing your will. 2) Joint Tenancy with a right of survivorship: Joint tenancy is the simplest way to transfer property. The name says it all: You jointly own property with your heirs with the proviso that when you die, they continue to own the property. (This is the default for married couples for the property they get during the marriage, where it is known as 'community property.') Sadly, you will need to fill out some paperwork to change to this form of property. 3) Transfer on Death Deed: Since 2016, California law has allowed a third option, a 'transfer on death deed.' This allows you to transfer some kinds of real property (basically, single family homes and small apartment buildings) directly to your heirs on your death. (You can make similar arrangements for many bank and brokerage accounts as well.) Because this is a deed, it involves some paperwork.Each of these methods of handling your property offers a different mix of costs and benefits. Each is handled differently legally (a will must go through probate, which requires supervision by a court; trusts do not), and may have different tax consequences. Which best suits your needs depends on what you own, where you live, and who you want to get what.  What is to be done? As you just found out, it is not always easy to figure how best to instantiate your wishes on your own. If you are lucky, someone who knows enough about CA trust and estate law will see your question and take the time to write up a complete and correct answer for you. For many reasons, this probably isn't going to happen. In the meantime, you have two other options. First, you can search for information online. My quick search turned up lots of pages narrowly focused on CA estate law, many with accurate information. Second, you can talk to a lawyer who specializes in CA trust and estate law, to find out what options you have under CA law, and what the costs\/benefits they offer you. My advice would be to skip the searches and call a lawyer. Obviously, YMMV.  Practical advice about advice: 1) You should probably talk to your accountant about the tax consequences of these various approaches to estate planning. Lawyers are not always clear on tax side of estate planning. (Conversely, accountants are not always clear on the legal aspects of estate planning.)2) Since you hate paperwork, you should not rely on your broker (or real estate agent, or...) for either legal or tax advice. They know much less than they think they do, and can cause big problems. (Even if their bad advice does not cost you $$$, the paper work needed to fix their mistakes can be mind-numbing.)"}
{"question":"In criminal matters, if a judge makes statements during oral arguments that clearly show that the judge has a misunderstanding of the case law pertaining to the matter at hand, can the judge's decision be appealed even if the written decision itself does not contain an explicit error?For example, let's imagine the police search a car and find an illegal item. The defendant makes a motion to have the evidence from the search suppressed on the grounds that the police had no probable cause to search the vehicle. Whether the police had probable cause in the case is complex issue involving many different facts. Let's imagine that one of these facts is that the police officer stated that the car owner's mechanic told him that the the car's airbag system had been tinkered with, a violation of US Federal regulations. During oral argument the defense argues that the possible violation of a Federal regulation is not grounds for a search. The judge then speaks out and says that violation of a regulation is still a crime and therefore potentially grounds for search. Later, in the written decision, the judge dismisses the motion to suppress, but does not explicitly give his reasons or gives other reasons, not involving the violation of a regulation.So, let's assume for the sake of argument that the judge made an error when he stated that violating a regulation is a \"crime\" and therefore grounds for local police to search a vehicle. Can the defense argue that even though this error does not appear in written form in the judge's decision, the fact that he said such a thing in court shows that he has a defective and incorrect understanding of laws relevant to the motion, therefore he is not fit to make a ruling on such laws.So, imagine that the appeals court finds that the judge has a clearly defective understanding of search and seizure law as evidences by his remarks in court. What is the outcome? Do they remand the case to the court, reverse the ruling, or take some other action?","answer":"Only if counsel challenged the point during the trialDifficult as it might be, you cant allow the judge to be wrong during the trial without calling them on it: very, very politely.For example, there is case law that says you cant successfully appeal because the judge was asleep through significant parts of the trial; appeals courts are clear that you have to wake them up. If you dont then you accepted that you didnt want the judge to hear the parts of the case they slept through, its your choice how you present your case. Frankly some cases are better if the judge misses half the evidence.Of course, if the error of law makes it through to the oral or written judgement then you can appeal even if you didnt take issue with it."}

For example, if Biden actually said what  \"claims,\" it would certainly harm his reputation. Could that article be considered libelous?","answer":"Something labeled, and indeed intended, as satire can be defamation ifpeople believe that the statements made are in fact true of the person concerned (the subject), or that the satire implies such statements about subject; andthe statements about the subject made or implied in the satire are in fact false; andsuch statements tend to harm the reputation of the subject.Satire can be, and has been, used as a cover for pointed statements about the subject, and in some cases such statements  can constitute libel (or slander).In the US a libel plaintiff would have the additional burdens of:showing actual damage, or else showing that the statements fell into one of the limited categories of libel per se; andIf the plaintiff is a public official or public figure, showing actual malice under the rule of .Those burdens exist in every US libel or defamation action, whether a satire is used or not.That something is labeled as or treated as a satire may indicate that it is not to be believed.

{"question":"It's common for US domestic flights to cross into Canadian or Mexican airspace. For example, a flight from Alaska to New York, Seattle to Boston, or Hawaii to Texas would likely cross into foreign airspace.However, as far as I know, this is not legally considered a border crossing. In my experience, there is no passport control.What exactly does the law say about this? What is the determining factor of a whether border crossing has occurred when air travel is involved?Can  that crossed into foreign airspace?Furthermore, if an domestic flight made an emergency landing in another country, what would happen to the passengers who don't have their documents with them? Is there a special legal provision for such scenarios?","answer":"On such a flight whilst it's overflying non-US airspace (not necessarily airspace over the U.S.A. proper, as the U.S.A controls airspace outside its own sovereign territory), then it is classed as being in the international airspace of the country that controls it e.g. Canada, or Mexico. As such, in the event of an emergency landing, then any passengers without suitable documents would most likely be returned to the country that they came from e.g. the USA.Hopefully the authorities of that country e.g. the USA would then be able to let them back in, however this could get complicated because you aren't supposed to take luggage with you when evacuating an aircraft in an emergency. I honestly have no clue what the U.S. Authorities would do with someone who was returned to the U.S.A. from another country e.g. Canada, or Mexico, with no documents whatsoever in that scenario."}

Indeed, if they just ticketed people because their permit could not be seen through the snow, there would be a huge public outrage.

{"question":"There's a county park with some hiking trails near our house that my wife and I like to walk through in the mornings. We walk along the public road to get to the park, hike the trails, and return home via a wash (dry riverbed) that runs behind the park back towards the main road. We, and several other neighborhood residents, have been doing this for years.Recently we had an encounter with a nearby resident claiming that we were trespassing on private property as were walking through the wash. We checked the property records, and indeed, there are two parcels of private land through which we were crossing to get back on the main road. Both parcels are vacant, unmarked, not fenced, and not owned by any of the nearby residents.I'm not overly concerned with this person's claims as we aren't entering their property, but yesterday we found two posted signs in the wash at the park boundary stating: Private property. No public access. The signs were apparently installed by the county and seem legitimate with county seal and all. My question is, do these signs constitute reasonable notice (as described below) since they were not posted by the private landowners? states (emphasis mine):13-1502. Criminal trespass in the third degree; classificationA. A person commits criminal trespass in the third degree by:Knowingly entering or remaining unlawfully on any real property after a reasonable request to leave by a law enforcement officer, the owner or any other person having lawful control over such property, or reasonable notice prohibiting entry.Knowingly entering or remaining unlawfully on the right-of-way for tracks, or the storage or switching yards or rolling stock of a railroad company.B. Pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section, a request to leave by a law enforcement officer acting at the request of the owner of the property or any other person having lawful control over the property has the same legal effect as a request made by the property owner or other person having lawful control of the property.C. Criminal trespass in the third degree is a class 3 misdemeanor.The words on the sign are clear enough, but can the county speak for the owner of the vacant lots who, as far as I'm aware, don't know or care about what's going on? Is there any room to interpret the sign as simply a park boundary leaving the owners of the adjacent property to post their own \"no trespassing\" signs as they feel necessary (or not)?Follow-up question: If the sign does constitute an enforceable, reasonable notice, would the private property owner(s) have to get involved for trespassing charges to be filed?","answer":"The county can certainly post a sign on the edge of the county property, informing people that what lies beyond is private property, and no permission to pass has been granted. Unless this was endorsed by the property owner or the owner's agent, I don't think this would constitute the reasonable notice mentioned in 13-1502 A 1 (quoted above) needed to make entry count as criminal trespass. If the property owner authorizes the county to post notices, that is of course different.I don't see how the county can be considered a person having lawful control over such property but the law does not say that reasonable notice must be given by an owner or owner's agent, indeed it does not say who may or may not give such notice. I wonder if there is caselaw on the point.Since the law makes a request from a law enforcement officer, who could be acting with no authorization from the owner, one of the possible conditions for criminal trespass, I don't see that the owner would need to participate in a trespass action."}
{"question":"The  recognizes a 'right of revolution'.Has anyone used Article 10 as the legal justification for something they have done? In how many cases has it been successfully so used, and in how many unsuccessfully? What happened?[Art.] 10. [Right of Revolution.] Government being instituted for the common benefit, protection, and security, of the whole community, and not for the private interest or emolument of any one man, family, or class of men; therefore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought to reform the old, or establish a new government. The doctrine of nonresistance against arbitrary power, and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind.","answer":"Article 10 of Part I of the Constitution of New Hampshire (Article 10, Part II relates to classification of town governments) is mentioned in five reported appellate cases in the history of New Hampshire since it was adopted in 1784 that I could locate. It has never successfully been effective to protect the rights of anyone invoking it. (It is possible that it has been argued in a trial court on a jury nullification theory, but such cases wouldn't produce reported cases as criminal acquittals cannot be appealed by the government.) The cases, and the pertinent part of each ruling, are as follows:Orr v. Quimby, 54 N.H. 590, 619 (1874), it was held to create a moral rather than a legal right:  The legal idea of a bill of rights is a declaration of private rights,  annexed to and made a part of a constitutional grant of governmental  power. Reservation is, in general, the purpose and legal meaning of  such declaration. For exceptional reasons, applicable to the  construction of article 10, the right of insurrection there declared  is evidently a moral right, not reserved as a legal one. But many of  the most important constitutional rights are reserved in terms much  less imperative than 'shall' and 'shall not.' The right of petitioning  for a redress of grievances (the plaintiff's sole remedy, if the plea  is good) is reserved by a simple declaration of the right, without a  word literally signifying a command or prohibition.It was also addressed in the case Opinion of the Justices, 144 N.H. 374, 746 A.2d 981 (1999) where it was found to not invalidate a means of raising revenue for a municipal electrical utility:  Question two inquires whether HB 536 'violate[s] the constitutional  provision that government is instituted for the common benefit,  protection, and security, of the whole community, and not for the  private interest or emolument of any one man, family, or class of men  under part I, article 10 of the New Hampshire constitution?' We answer  this question in the negative.    Part I, Article 10 provides:    Government being instituted for the common benefit, protection, and  security, of the whole community, and not for the private interest or  emolument of any one man, family, or class of men; therefore, whenever  the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty manifestly  [746 A.2d 987] endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people  may, and of right ought to reform the old, or establish a new  government. The doctrine of nonresistance against arbitrary power, and  oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and  happiness of mankind.    This provision of our constitution has commonly been regarded as enumerating a citizen's right to reform an ineffectual or  manifestly corrupt form of government. See City of Claremont v.  Craigue, 135 N.H. 528, 533-34, 608 A.2d 866, 869 (1992); Nelson v.  Wyman, 99 N.H. 33, 50, 105 A.2d 756, 770 (1954). We have recognized  for over one hundred years, however, that this provision is imbued  with '[t]he principle of equality [that] pervades the entire  constitution,' State v. Pennoyer, 65 N.H. 113, 114, 18 A. 878, 879  (1889), and as such, Article 10 provides support for the maxim that  '[t]he law cannot discriminate in favor of one citizen to the  detriment of another.' Id. Thus, Part I, Article 10 has been  recognized as providing for more than a 'right of revolution'; rather,  it is one of many provisions in our Bill of Rights that forms the  basis for a citizen's right to equal protection. See, e.g., Town of  Chesterfield v. Brooks, 126 N.H. 64, 67, 489 A.2d 600, 602 (1985)  (zoning ordinance violated equal protection rights guaranteed by Part  I, Articles 1, 2, 10, 12, and 14); Gazzola v. Clements, 120 N.H. 25,  29, 411 A.2d 147, 151 (1980) (statute violated equal protection rights  guaranteed by Part I, Articles 1, 10, 12, and 14).    Pursuant to the principle of equality inherent in Article 10, this court found that the raising of tax revenue to aid an electric  utility would violate Part I, Article 10's mandate that government is  'instituted for the common benefit ... of the whole community, and not  for the private interest or emolument of any one man, family, or class  of men.' Opinion of the Justices, 88 N.H. 484, 489, 190 A. 425, 429  (1937).    Aid to a utility is forbidden except in protection of the public  welfare and interest. And the protection must be in a needed service  furnished the public by the utility as a condition of the aid. Without  the condition the protective principle is inapplicable. Unconditional  aid is not a proper charge of government to be met by the taxpayers.  144 N.H. 382    Id. at 488-89, 190 A. at 428. The court noted that the existing public  utilities already provided sufficient power to service State  customers, and that any additional supply was sent out-of-state. Id.  at 489, 190 A. at 429. The court reasoned that because the  transmission of additional electric energy outside the State served no  public purpose, and thus the need for public funds for additional  development was a private, not public, purpose, the proposed aid was  unconstitutional. Id.    In this case, however, the legislature is proposing to create a tax exemption, rather than directly raising tax revenue to subsidize  private purposes. Cf. Opinion of the Justices (Mun. Tax Exemptions for  Indus. Constr.), 142 N.H. at 101, 697 A.2d at 124 (finding  determinative under Part II, Article 5 that there was not direct  expenditure, but rather a uniform exemption of state-wide  application). Moreover, even if one views an exemption as simply a  form of direct grant, see Eyers Woolen Co. v. Gilsum, 84 N.H. 1, 9,  146 A. 511, 515 (1929) (exemptions are 'in effect, a compulsory  payment of money, by those who bear their shares of the common burden,  to the privileged person who does not bear his share'), the public  benefit gained by this legislation is sufficient to render it  constitutional. Our constitution does not require absolute equality of  burden in the case of exemptions. 'The resulting inequality or  discrimination against unexempted property is not fatal to the  constitutionality of the exemption,' Opinion of the Justices, 87 N.H.  490, 491, 178 A. 125, 126 (1935), provided 'it advances a public  purpose,' Opinion of the Justices, 95 N.H. at 550, 65 A.2d at 701, and  is 'properly within the legislature's discretion in acting for the  welfare of the state,' Opinion of  [746 A.2d 988] the Justices, 87 N.H. at 491, 178 A. at 126. As stated  above, the benefit to be gained by HB 536 is increased competition and  customer choice, and not necessarily the need for additional power.  Further, deregulation of the electric utility industry is 'properly  within the legislature's discretion in acting for the welfare of the  state,' id., and it is proper for the legislature to enact exemptions  that promote the economic well-being of the State, see Opinion of the  Justices (Mun. Tax Exemptions for Indus. Constr.), 142 N.H. at 100,  697 A.2d at 123. Accordingly, the tax exemption is properly granted  under the legislature's 'constitutional power to provide for the  common benefit, protection and security,' Opinion of the Justices, 88  N.H. at 487, 190 A.2d at 428, and does not violate Part I, Article 10.    To the extent that question two implicates additional equal protection guarantees under Part I, Article 10, cf. Gazzola, 120 N.H.  at 29, 411 A.2d at 151, we conduct our analysis concurrently with the  next question you posed; namely, whether HB 536 improperly classifies  taxable property such that the burden of taxation is inequitably  distributed, cf. Rosenblum v. Griffin, 89 N.H. 314, 320-21, 197 A.  701, 706 (1938) (constitutional issue of classification decided under  Part I, Article 10). For the reasons stated below, this part of  question two is answered in the negative.In another case, City of Claremont v. Craigue, 135 N.H. 528, 608 A.2d 866 (1992), it was argued unsuccessfully, that voter approval cleansed an improperly adopted budget of the taint of improper steps taken prior to the vote:  Finally, the respondents cite part I, article 10 of the New  Hampshire Constitution, known as the right of revolution, as a general  right to self-determination. Part I, article 10 provides in pertinent  part that 'whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public  liberty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are  ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought to reform the old,  [135 N.H. 534] or establish a new government.' Without in any way detracting from the  continuing validity and truth of part I, article 10, we find that none  of [608 A.2d 870] the conditions specified in that article have been  met in this case. Prohibiting voter ratification of a city's budget  hardly 'perverts' the ends of government or manifestly endangers  public liberty, so long as the city's voters retain the right to elect  their local representatives. Moreover, the defendants have not  exhausted all other legal means of redress, since, as we noted above,  the legislature has set forth a statutory procedure for charter  revision, and that option remains available to the voters of  Claremont.    Therefore, the respondents' proposed revisions to the Claremont   city charter are invalid, and of no effect.It was brought up, without success, in , 154 N.H. 314, 911 A.2d 1 (2006), but I don't have access to that particular opinion in which an environmental regulation was challenged.It was raised in Nelson v. Wyman, 99 N.H. 33, 105 A.2d 756 (1954) where the court concluded that it did not invalidate a McCarthy era law:  It is also strongly urged by the plaintiff that the Legislature of  this state cannot proscribe activities looking to the overthrow of  government by force or violence because of Article 10 of the Bill of  Rights which provides, in part, that whenever the ends of government  are perverted, and public liberty manifestly endangered, and all other  means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought,  to reform the old, or establish a new government. The doctrine of  nonresistance against arbitrary power, and oppression, is absurd,  slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind. With  this interpretation we cannot agree. The right reserved to the people  by this Article is not such a broad and unlimited right of  insurrection and rebellion as to permit any group which is  dissatisfied with existing government to lawfully attempt at any time  to overthrow the government by force or violence. It is not claimed by  the plaintiff that the ends of government are now perverted, public liberty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress *  * * ineffectual but it is only when those conditions prevail that the right to resist and to reform the old, or establish a new  government exists. The right possessed by the people of this state as  a protection against arbitrary power and oppression cannot be utilized  to justify the violent overthrow of government when the adoption of  peaceful and orderly changes, properly reflecting the will of the  people, may be accomplished through the existing structure of  government.    99 N.H. 51    Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, 501, 549, 71 S.Ct. 857, 95  L.Ed. 1137. To require a government representative of the people, in  the face of preparations for revolution by force, to refrain from  acting to curb the [105 A.2d 771] outbreak of violence and to confine  itself solely to holding answerable those persons who have committed  crimes of violence and terrorized the community in the name of  revolution must result in anarchy. Dennis v. United States, supra, 341  U.S. 501, 71 S.Ct. 857. Article 10 was not intended to accomplish this  result.    So far as the circumstances of this case have required an examination of the 1951 act, we conclude that it is constitutional  upon its face, so as to furnish a basis for the resolution of 1953."}

If I call this duck a chicken; it's still a duck.Similarly, the duck may call itself a chicken. It may even believe it's a chicken. It's still a duck.Now, I might want to call the duck a chicken because ducks have fewer workplace rights than chickens. Similarly, the duck might want to be a chicken because chickens can be more ... creative ... with their taxes; they might even be able to funnel their income through special C-corporations (C is for chicken). It's still a duck.The law doesn't care what you call your relationship or even what you think your relationship is - it cares about what it actually is.Is a freelance software developer a duck or a chicken?The actual law can be found . Starting from the beginning:2750.3. (a) (1) For purposes of the provisions of this code and the Unemployment Insurance Code, and for the wage orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission, a person providing labor or services for remuneration shall be considered an employee rather than an independent contractor unless the hiring entity demonstrates that all of the following conditions are satisfied:(A) The person is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact.(B) The person performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entitys business.(C) The person is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as that involved in the work performed.So a freelance software developer who is working without their client's control and direction about when, where and how they do their work (obviously, direction on the final product is OK), for a client who doesn't normally develop that type of software (e.g. writing a website for a hairdresser or even writing accounting software for a computer game developer but not writing computer games for a computer game developer) and that there exists such a 'thing' as independent software developers (which there are) can be correctly classified as a contractor. A person who goes into a software house to work on their in-house code is an employee.So after the initial classification, there is a bundle of exemptions and exceptions. None of them are particularly relevant until we get to:(e) Subdivision (a) and the holding in Dynamex do not apply to a bona fide business-to-business contracting relationship, as defined below, under the following conditions:(1) If a business entity formed as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or corporation (business service provider) contracts to provide services to another such business (contracting business), the determination of employee or independent contractor status of the business services provider shall be governed by Borello, if the contracting business demonstrates that all of the following criteria are satisfied:(A) The business service provider is free from the control and direction of the contracting business entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact.(B) The business service provider is providing services directly to the contracting business rather than to customers of the contracting business.(C) The contract with the business service provider is in writing.(D) If the work is performed in a jurisdiction that requires the business service provider to have a business license or business tax registration, the business service provider has the required business license or business tax registration.(E) The business service provider maintains a business location that is separate from the business or work location of the contracting business.(F) The business service provider is customarily engaged in an independently established business of the same nature as that involved in the work performed.(G) The business service provider actually contracts with other businesses to provide the same or similar services and maintains a clientele without restrictions from the hiring entity.(H) The business service provider advertises and holds itself out to the public as available to provide the same or similar services.(I) The business service provider provides its own tools, vehicles, and equipment to perform the services.(J) The business service provider can negotiate its own rates.(K) Consistent with the nature of the work, the business service provider can set its own hours and location of work.(L) The business service provider is not performing the type of work for which a license from the Contractors State License Board is required, pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code.Summarising this: if the freelance software developer is part of a bonafide business providing services to the 'public' and not just to this employer then they can be correctly classified as a contractor."}

{"question":"Backstory:I had moved into a new apartment back in February, 2015. The building was brand new, but the business running it doesn't seem to be. In the Summer of 2015, a music festival started taking place every Thursday in a park across the street. During these days, nearly all available parking locations (within 3 blocks) are filled. I complained to the manager and asked for alternative parking solutions. I had also noted that there were non-residents parking in the resident-only backlot and even some vehicles parking illegally (in white-lined areas and some in handicap spots without placards).Nearing the last few weeks of the event, they had sent out an email mentioning that the backlot would now be paid permit-only parking. Although a mere $5\/month, it was aggravating since the issue was the lack of places and now anyone who didnt pay is being even more restricted on parking locations. This seemed like a cash grab. Fast forward to now; I noticed about a week ago that they put up the permit-only posts in front of the apartment now. I hadnt received an email or any type of lease addendum, so I had got in touch with them asking what was going on. They got back saying that the front stalls are now permit-only parking too and share the same cost as the ones in the back.Questions: Can parking restrictions like this take place at any time, even mid-lease?The first instance being in Fall, 2015, where they started charging $5\/month for parking; the contract didn't have the $5\/month clause that it did when revised for my February, 2016 renewal.The second instance being these past few weeks where they've essentially converted available street parking into permit parking when the clause was agreed, and still denotes, that the exterior parking lot was the only permit-based parking.Is there any way to fight back since my rental agreement is now slightly diminished due to losing some features it once had?Would my time consulting a tenant lawyer have any hope at this rate or is this possibly a lost cause?The contract in February, 2015, had the following clauses: Indoor parking spaces are available for $40.00 per month. Only one  indoor parking stall is allowed per apartment.  'The resident, their visitors and family family will obey any parking regulations promulgated in the future for the safety, comfort, and convenience of the residents and others using the premises.''While guests are permitted to use the exterior (Apartment Complex) parking area, Residents are encouraged to become familiar with the City of (My City)'s parking rules and regulations for the benefit of themselves and their guests. The City of (My City)'s parking rules and regulations can be found at (Website).'The contract in February, 2016, included this new\/updated clause: The exterior parking lot will be for (Apartment Complex)  residents only. Parking passes for the lot will be sold on a first  come, first serve basis at a cost of $5.00\/month. For on street  parking, please review the City of (My City)'s parking rules and  regulations which can be found at (Website).Update:It's come to my attention that parking across the street next to the park is no longer viable either. Those places are 2 hour parking and are effective at all days\/times of days, except holidays. They suggested to look into off-site parking...Does this claim that there is actually no free parking change anything?Please let me know if any further details needs to be provided or if there's anything that needs clarification.","answer":"Did your original rental agreement say that you could park in the backlot? If it did not (which seems to be the case) then your initial ability to do so was a non-contractural perk for which you have no ongoing right.What your landlord is required to do is in the lease; if he spontaneously turns up every Saturday afternoon with coffee and donuts then that is a nice gesture but it is not an obligation and you have no cause for complaint if it stops."}
{"question":"I moved this post off the medical stack exchange as it was flagged as off topic so hopefully this is the proper place for it.I have a problem with a thumbnail that has been lingering for months now and I finally decided to make an appointment with a dermatologist. I called, made the appointment, filled out the paperwork, etc. I showed up for the appointment and all was normal, scanned my drivers license, took my co-pay and confirmed my medical history. They called my name and took me back to the room and the assistant asked to take a front and side picture of my face. I noticed a screen on the wall showing before\/after shots of patients facial problems so I told the assistant that I was there for my thumb not any facial issues and she said it was for their records. I said I didn't mind if she took a picture of my thumb but that I didn't see any reason to take pictures of my face. Her tone immediately changed and she quickly finished the interview and left the room. A few minutes later a women walked in and introduced herself as the office manager and explained to me that it was their policy to take pictures of patients for 'security reasons' and that I would be refused service if I did not comply. I politely told her I understand she has to follow her policies and asked for a refund of my co-pay which she provided then I left the office. Can a doctor legally do this? Is this a violation of HIPAA? If so where would I file a complaint?","answer":"The 'Privacy Rule' () don't forbid this. Sect. 164.502 states the general rule:  (a) Standard. A covered entity or business associate may not use or  disclose protected health information, except as permitted or required  by this subpart or by subpart C of part 160 of this subchapter.'Health information' is defnes in part 160 as  any information, including genetic information, whether oral or  recorded in any form or medium, that:    (1) Is created or received by a health care provider, health plan,  public health authority, employer, life insurer, school or university,  or health care clearinghouse; and    (2) Relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health  or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an  individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision  of health care to an individual.Your picture would not constitute health information (and anyhow, they are allowed to gather health information, just not freely disseminate it  the pictures on the wall were presumably with permission).There is no general law (which would be state law) against taking a person's picture (though commercially exploiting someone's picture would require permission, via the concept of ), and it is directly required in a number of instances (for identification purposes  school ID, driver's license, passport, voting in some states). It is an unusual requirement and since they scanned your driver's license it is especially inexplicable. Assuming that this is just a story they tell all patients because they want before and after pictures (which you would have to consent to, if you didn't already in one of those 'sign here' flurries), saying that this is for 'security purposes' would be untrue, but I don't think it's actually illegal. Taking but not using a photo would not cause you harm, so if you had let them take the picture, there would not be a basis for suing. If they use it for advertising without permission, that would be a problem."}

{"question":"The FDA does not approve marijuana's psychoactive substance, THC, for any medicinal use, and possession of THC is a federal crime, except for prescription synthetic THC. However, 36 states legalized medical marijuana that includes THC. This legal dissonance looks startling to me. Given that, I wonder if medical marijuana is the only medicine in the US that is legalized in various states and nonetheless a Schedule 1 federal crime. And I clarify that this refers only to medicine and not Schedule 1 substances that are eligible for religious exception.","answer":"Basically yes.Any controlled substance under federal law that is not a Schedule I controlled substance can be prescribed by a medical professional consistent with state law, so the scope of the conflict is modest.Some  are: heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), marijuana (cannabis), peyote, methaqualone, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (Ecstasy).(But, keep in mind that heroin is basically almost indistinguishable from some Schedule II narcotics which can be prescribed, and that there is a narrow religious exemption for peyote.)The other Schedule I drugs are not commonly legalized under state law, although there are a few cases (Oregon, e.g.) where state law has decriminalized use of certain Schedule I drugs (most often peyote) without truly legalizing them in a state endorsed regulatory regime as has been done with marijuana.Sometimes imitation drugs that are chemical analogs of Schedule I drugs are criminalized on a case by case basis in an administrative process conducted in parallel at the federal and state level, with the state process in some states lagging the federal process. But that isn't really analogous to the situation with marijuana.Also, keep in mind that the state action contrary to federal prohibition involves at least tacit consent from U.S. attorneys and from legislation from Congress limiting expenditures of federal funds for enforcement of state legal marijuana transactions in most casees."}
{"question":"Hypothetical situation:Miss X, a software developer with 10 years of experience, has obtained a new job. On her first day she logs into her desktop computer and the operating system requests that she chooses a password.A few minutes later her line manager comes to talk to her and asks her to write the password to a piece of paper, place it inside an envelope, and seal and sign that envelope. He explains that if he needs access to the account when she is unreachable, he will open the envelope and use the password.In USA, can Miss X legally decline the request for her password?","answer":"IANAL, but: as an employee, you are working for a company that owns your work, a manager that manages you, as well as any software\/IP you produce, the PC and network you use, etc. So they can require a copy of your login\/password to the network.In a way, the manager and the company as a whole doesn't need a copy of your password; I'm sure the network administrator has root access to all accounts on the network, can access the passwords, and can change them at will to give or prevent your access.By asking to 'write the password to a piece of paper, place it inside an envelope, and seal and sign that envelope,' the manager is reasonable inneeding 'access to the account when she is unreachable,' i.e. out for the week, during a network security situation, or after you don't work there anymore.They may also want some sort of paper trail of your original password rather than depend on the network. That motivation is their own management style, possibly in conjunction with the network administrator, and\/or some requirement thought necessary by the legal department.If you decline, they may tell you the network administrator has your password anyway.

{"question":"Does a judge has the discretion to not jail someone who is guilty of having murdered someone? If not to what extent can he reduce a murder sentence if the verdict of the jury is guilty? I am wondering how much impact the bias of a judge can have on criminal sentencing in the U.S., because it seems that judges aren't always very objective.","answer":"In the US, there are limits on judicial sentencing discretion, which differ from state to state. For example, mandatory minimum sentences are common for certain crimes. Sentences may also be computed based on a statutory point system considering the nature of the crime and the person convicted (first-offender; multiple offender), so the judge looks the answer up in a table provided by the legislature.  to deviate from the norms (and a long list of justifications, i.e. mitigating circumstances). First degree homicide is subject to a mandatory minimum prison term of 20 years, but second degree murder is not subject to that minimum. Under the statutory guidelines, a second degree murder conviction would be subject to imprisonment, unless the mitigating circumstances statute held."}
{"question":"In the United States courts seem to be supposed to be public proceedings. For example, if a criminal trial is going on, I believe in most cases I cannot be prevented from entering that room and watching and listening to the proceeding, presumably because they are \"public\" proceedings. However, the legal basis for this is not clear to me.This question about the legal basis for law proceedings being public has become more trenchant now in the COVID era because many court proceedings are being held by telecast now. Before a judge could just physically grab and expel anybody trying to record the goings on in a court, but now that trials are being webcast, anyone can simply record the webcast. Some courts, like those in New Hampshire, have threatened to criminalize doing this and cite .What is the constitutionality of such laws? Is the public nature of courtroom proceedings at the whim of the state, or is there is a constitutional protection of public access to trials in public courts?","answer":"<h2 id='yes-there-is-a-right-clgu'>Yes there is a rightFor civil trials it is not a Constitutional right, its a Common Law one. Civil trials in the USA are public because trials in England were (and are) public.For criminal trials, the sixth amendment guarantees speedy and public trials.But, like all rights, it is not unfettered.In addition to practical considerations like how much room there is for a public audience, there are also trials or parts of trials from which the public is excluded. Family law and childrens court matters are almost always not public. Similarly, trials that deal with national security issues.The limitation on the right to public access must be balanced with issues such as privacy and security. While Constitutional rights are subject to strict scrutiny on limitations the same is not necessarily true of Common law rights, however, for such a longstanding right it would come close.As for recording trials: there is no right to do so other than by taking notes. Unsurprisingly, there is no specific right in the Constitution for audio or visual recording because the technical ability to do so post-dates the Bill of Rights by about a century. Therefore there is no Constitutional right or Common law right. Most courts can allow or disallow recordings at their discretion."}
{"question":"In 21st century America the laws governing libel, slander and defamation are wholly separate even through they overlap in substantial areas, rather than there being a single law covering all three. Is this merely because this is the way that it was under British rule and the laws haven't been combined, or have there been attempts to combine them which have been rejected by the court system for citable reasons?","answer":"US LawCombining the traditionally separate common-law torts of libel and slander would probably be a matter not for the court system, but for the legislature, and these are matters of sate law in the US, and vary from one state to another. Many states have not codified the law of defamation by statute, and one must check court cases in each state to find the particular rules that apply in that state.As Nolo's page on  says:Defamation of character is a catch-all term for any statement that hurts someone's reputation. Written defamation is called libel, while spoken defamation is called slander.To the best of my knowledge, there is no US state that has three separate torts, libel, slander, and defamation. Some states, such as Illinois,  have combined libel and slander into a single tort of defamation, others have not.Traditionally, in a slander case the plaintiff must prove actual damages, whereas damage could be presumed in a libel case. (see the  for confirmation of this.) States that have preserved the distinction retain this difference in many cases. That is one reason why some states have not combined them. Another is legislative inertia: if the existing laws are working well enough, why go to the effort of rewriting them? When the law of defamation has not been codified, the traditional reluctance of common law courts to change form where there is no significant change of substance also works against combining the torts.See also the Wikipedia page on <h3>Specific State Laws<\/h3>California: Georgia: Illinois: Pensylvania See  from the Digital Media law Project for case citations in many US states.Non-US LawIn some other common-law countries, the difference has also been preserved, probably for similar reasons.

It is difficult to pinpoint a specific time when the naming conventions for legislation in the two countries diverged, as the process has likely been a gradual one.In general, the United States and the United Kingdom both have a long history of using names or titles to identify and refer to legislation. In the United States, legislation is typically given a short and descriptive title, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In the United Kingdom, legislation is often referred to by its short title, which may include the year in which it was enacted, such as the Companies Act 2006 or the Bribery Act 2010.These naming conventions have evolved over time and have been influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in the political and legal systems of the two countries.

Today (March 18th) I was surprised to find out that the gym charged me for monthly membership, even though the company is unable to render its contractual services. Am I eligible for a refund? Normally I'd file a chargeback immediately, but I'm not sure if this being a health emergency gives the gym the right to charge for membership while keeping its doors closed. ","answer":"Under current state law, the state of emergency does not clearly change anything. The health club contract law is : the crucial thing is, you have to read the contract. The law did not anticipate a governmentally-mandated shutdown, but does address the question of cancellations in RCW 19.142.040(7). The two most-relevant conditions are:  (c) If a contract extends for more than one year, the buyer may cancel  the contract for any reason upon thirty days' written notice to the  health studio;    (d) If the health studio facilities are permanently closed and  comparable facilities owned and operated by the seller are not made  available within a ten-mile radius of the closed facility;But, I assume neither is actually applicable (membership is not longer than a year, the closure is not permanent). (8) also requires 'Clauses explaining the buyer's right to a refund and relief from future payment obligations after cancellation of the contract' (that is, they have to say what your rights are).There is nothing illegal about a contract clause that says something like 'If the facility is temporarily shut down due to circumstances beyond our control, we will extend your membership (obligation) by the duration of the shut-down'. As a general matter of contract law, one party cannot unilaterally modify the term of a contract, unless there is a clause that permits them to do so. State law requires that the contract have a stated duration. So one argument that you could make is that without an escape clause in the contract, they are in government-mandated breech of contract. (But it is highly likely that there is some such clause in the contract). The crucial legal question is, what gives you the right to cancel the contract? If you have such a right, then the law also states the pro-rata refund requirements."}
{"question":"I have a question about the Fifth Amendment.Imagine I committed a crime but I was acquitted at trial. After some time, some new evidence came up showing that I did do it. Does the Fifth Amendment say that I can't be charged for it again, even if there is new evidence?","answer":"That's basically correct. The Double Jeopardy clause prevents the federal and state governments from trying you again for a crime that you've already been acquitted of, no matter what new evidence turns up. Even if you confessed to the crime, you could still not be tried.The relevant text of the  reads:No person shall ... be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.The case of  is probably among the most famous examples. He was charged with murdering a woman, but acquitted at trial. About a year later, a guy laying carpet at his house pulled up floorboards and found the victim's jewelry, along with pictures of Ignatow murdering the victim. Ignatow confessed, but the state couldn't charge him with murder again, though they could charge him perjury for testifying that he hadn't killed her.So the answer is yes, the Fifth Amendment generally prevents the government from trying you for a crime you've been acquitted of.There are two main caveats here. First is the dual-sovereignty principle, which accounts for the fact that almost anywhere that the Fifth Amendment applies, a person is subject to the laws of two sovereign governments: the federal government and that of whatever state the person is in. For example, robbing a bank in Los Angeles would violate the laws of both the United States and California. If California put you on trial, but you were acquitted, the Double Jeopardy Clause would bar California from trying you again, but it would not be a defense if the federal government wanted to try to charge you again.Second is the language about the same offence, which is not as clear as it might sound at first. In the course of committing a crime, a person can easily commit many other crimes without thinking of it. In your bank robbery, for instance, you could easily break the following additional laws: trespassing, menacing, carrying a concealed weapon, brandishing a firearm, larceny, grand larceny. This raises the question of what affect your acquittal on the robbery charge has on the possibility of charging you on these other offenses.The answer can be found in :The applicable rule is that, where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.This is easier to understand in practice than in theory. If you want to bring charges for the same conduct without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause, you need to be able to make a Venn diagram where the first charge and the new charge each has at least one element that the other does not. So map out the following possible offenses involved in a robbery:theft: unlawfully taking the property of another personaggravated theft: unlawfully taking the property of another person, when the property is worth more than $1,000menacing: threatening to injure another personaggravated menacing: threatening to injure another person while brandishing a deadly weaponrobbery: unlawfully taking the property of another person, facilitated by a threat to injure another personaggravated robbery: unlawfully taking the property of another person, facilitated by a threat to injure another person while brandishing a deadly weaponSo now you have a Venn diagram that looks like this:If you've been acquitted of robbery, a prosecutor who wants to charge you again needs to find an offense that (1) requires proof of a fact that robbery did not, and (2) does not require proof of a fact that robbery did.This means the prosecutor can't bring a charge for the greater offense of aggravated robbery, because the earlier robbery charge didn't require proof of anything that aggravated robbery would not. The prosecutor also can't bring a charge for theft or menacing, because neither requires proof of anything that robbery did not. These are called lesser included offenses.But a charge for aggravated theft would be allowed. Although there's a shared element between aggravated theft and robbery (taking the property of another), there are also unique elements to both aggravated theft (property worth more than $1,000) and robbery (a threat to injure another). A charge for aggravated menacing would also be allowed, as it requires proof of brandishing a deadly weapon, but does not require proof of taking the property of another."}
{"question":"My 83 year old mother's mental and physical health has deteriorated rapidly in last six months. At this point, she asks if her mother (dead 35 years) is coming to see her, if her grandchildren are taking music lessons in elementary school (all graduated from college now), etc.She is married to a much younger man, my stepfather, a good guy who loves her and only wants the best for her, and he has asked if she has a DNR wish.There is no DNR order in effect that anyone knows about, and I'm pretty confident that she would not be considered competent to be able to understand her situation well enough to make her own decision regarding this.My guess is that it would be the husband's decision, even if he asks for and takes the advice of her children (my brothers and sister and I).Is this correct?DISCLAIMER: I'm obviously not asking for binding, rock-solid legal advice here, just wondering if anyone has any idea before we inevitably go to a lawyer.(By the way, the jurisdiction is the State of Florida, USA)","answer":"One of four people can make the decision in most jurisdictions:The patient themselves, if they are of sound and reasonable mindThe patient's next of kin, if the patient is not able to make the decision themselvesThe patients enduring power of attorney for health, and they can override the next of kin's decision on thisThe doctor themselves, if they determine that a resuscitation attempt would not provide meaningful quality of life for the patient - they can, but typically do not in most cases, override the above threes decisions (e.g., there's no moral or ethical reason to resuscitate a 100 year old severely demented individual who is bed bound, even when the family demands it)In your case, the difficulty is the next of kin aspect - who has priority here, the husband or the child.

{"question":"There are a number of churches in the United States that operate universities, and I understand that these universities are legally permitted to give preference to members of the church when hiring for academic and other positions, or even to entirely exclude non-members from the hiring process.My question is whether it is legally permissible for these universities to terminate an existing employee, whom they had hired already knowing that the employee was not a member of the church, for the sole reason that the employee is not a member of the church.For example, Brigham Young University is affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS). Suppose that the University wants to hire a new professor of mathematics but can't find any qualified LDS candidates for the position, and so gives the job to Alice, knowing full well that she is an atheist. Some time into Alice's contract, the university finds Bob, who has similar qualifications as Alice but is an LDS member.Could the university terminate Alice's contract on purely religious grounds in order to give her professorship to Bob? (That is, assume that there exist no other grounds on which the university could justify a dismissali.e., Alice has been maintaining satisfactory job performance, has not been violating the school's honour code, etc.)","answer":"It depends on whether Alice is a minister.This case plays on the tension between employment-discrimination laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, and the First Amendment, which protects a religious group's right to shape its own faith and mission through its appointments. .We resolve the question by asking whether Alice is a minister, i.e., whether the religion has entrusted her with the responsibility of educating and forming students in the faith . If so, she falls within the First Amendment's ministerial exception to employment-discrimination laws.But the precise definition of that term remains rather squishy, so we don't really have a test that can give us a reliable answer. In Hosanna-Tabor, for instance, a teacher at a religious school brought an ADA claim after the school fired her after she missed a semester on disability leave. The court rejected her claims based on the religious character of her work, and the Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that she was a minister based on the job title she received (Minister of Religion, Commissioned), her own use of the minister title, the religious character of many of her job responsibilities, her religious training, and other factors.Although she was a minister who was replaced by another minister, the Court suggested that the outcome might be the same if she were not a minister. Noting that the school in that case  just like in your hypothetical  hired lay teachers only when ministers were not available, it rejected the argument that an employee falls outside the ministerial exception simply because there are non-ministers with the same job functions:Though relevant, it cannot be dispositive that others not formally recognized as ministers by the church perform the same functionsparticularly when, as here, they did so only because commissioned ministers were unavailable. Hosanna-Tabor at 193.And a few years later, the Court indicated that perhaps none of those factors from Hosanna-Tabor are actually required. Instead, it directed courts to ask whether the school entrusts a teacher with the responsibility of educating and forming students in the faith. Our Lady of Guadalupe School at 2069.So in your hypothetical, the courts would probably look to see whether BYU treats its professorships as ministerial positions. Although the answer could vary from one religious school to the next, it seems quite likely that the courts would treat BYU professors as ministers, given their Personnel Conduct Policy:It is a condition of employment that all personnel (including student employees) act in accordance with university policies and the Church Educational System Honor Code, including the Dress and Grooming Standards, and refrain from behavior or expression that seriously and adversely affects the university mission or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Examples include behavior or expression thatContradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy;Deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders; orViolates the Church Educational System Honor Code.All personnel are expected to be role models of a life that combines the quest for intellectual rigor with spiritual values and personal integrity, and to conduct their work in a professional manner consistent with the values espoused by the university and the Church. Members of the Church in nonstudent positions also accept as a condition of employment the standards of conduct consistent with qualifying for temple privileges. The university regularly contacts ecclesiastical leaders concerning the temple eligibility of all nonstudent personnel who are members of the Church.I couldn't find any cases applying the ministerial exception to Brigham Young, but given its expectation that employees act as role models for the church's spiritual values and conduct their work in a manner consistent with values espoused by ... the church, I would be surprised to see a court get in the middle of the school's decisions to fire Alice and replace her with a member of the church, even if she had not run afoul of those policies herself.The interest of society in the enforcement of employment discrimination statutes is undoubtedly important. But so too is the interest of religious groups in choosing who will preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out their mission. When a minister who has been fired sues her church alleging that her termination was discriminatory, the First Amendment has struck the balance for us. The church must be free to choose those who will guide it on its way.Hosanna-Tabor at 196.Still, Alice could have other bases for suing the school. Based on your tags, I'm assuming you're most interested in employment-discrimination claims. While those might be barred by the First Amendment, Hosanna-Tabor explicitly held open the possibility that a contract claim might still be viable. Hosanna-Tabor at 196 (We express no view on whether the exception bars other types of suits, including actions by employees alleging breach of contract or tortious conduct by their religious employers.).So if the school signed a contract agreeing to employ Alice for three years, she would have a strong argument that it had waived its right to discriminate on the basis of religion for that period."}
{"question":"Super Zoo Story is a game in development that is accused of ripping off Stardew Valley.One of the issues is that the game uses a very similar pixel art style, similar themes, and above all gives they impression that it's a mod of Stardew Valley or is otherwise affiliated with them. The developers seem to be doing this on purpose- though they are an entirely different company with no permission to do this.Assuming none of their assets are actually stolen, what laws (if any) could they be breaking by doing this?","answer":"Generally, distinct art styles are not copyrighted in and of themselves.  Even when they have a unique look to the product, copying them to evoke that product's aesthetic is not in and of itself illegal and when it is in violation, could be met with an affirmative defense of Fair Use which protects derivative works that are transformative in nature of the original.What most likely be happening here though seems to be that the company that is making Super Zoo Story may have purchased the rights to the game engine that is being used by Stardew Valley (or acquired them through other legal means).  In gaming terms, a game engine is an underling set of codes that form the games backbone.  It's not uncommon for game makers to reuse their in house engines or engines for which they have licenses to use, as much of the game world's physics are coded in the engine.  This allows for more streamlined code if new assests are required, as the basics are there for such things.  The big change between two games running the same engine would be world layout and tweaks with new features.For example, among the first two Pokemon generations, there was little difference in the physics of the world with Gold\/Silver only having a few new features over Red\/Blue in that respect.  The combat system remains the same, and the general rules of the over world were almost identical.  Most of the differences were new interactions with these systems, updated visuals and some asset changes to existing maps.Similarly, Rockstar Entertainment uses RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Gaming Engine) as the backbone just about every game they have released since 2006.  The only major changes are new features that might improve on previous releases and better graphics capability.  Compare GTA IV to GTAV and both of those to Read Dead Redemption 2 (each successive one blows the predecessor out of the water)."}

{"question":"A 12-year-old living in the U.S. \"sexted\" with a 14-year-old in Sweden.Was any crime committed?Are there possible legal consequences for either child having engaged in that act?","answer":"In the US, the various child pornography laws apply only if there is an actual picture of an actual child. A computer-generated image does not count under those laws, unless it is recognizably of an actual identifiable person who is or was a minor at the time, nor does a description of sex with a child, no matter how graphic or realistic.However I need to point out that any accusation of child pornography is potentially very serious, and any person who has been or might plausibly have been accused of such would do well to consult a lawyer who can review the exact facts and has tools to check recent caselaw. says:Images of child pornography are not protected under First Amendment rights, and are illegal contraband under federal law. Section 2256 of Title 18, United States Code, defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor (someone under 18 years of age).  Visual depictions include photographs, videos, digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor, and images created, adapted, or modified, but appear to depict an identifiable, actual minor.  Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal visual depictions under federal law.That page cites:18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251- Sexual Exploitation of Children (Production of child pornography)18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251A- Selling and Buying of Children18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252- Certain activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors (Possession, distribution and receipt of child pornography)18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A- certain activities relating to material constituting or containing child pornography18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256- Definitions18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2260- Production of sexually explicit depictions of a minor for importation into the United StatesThe  mentions that:Simulated child pornography was made illegal with the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA). The CPPA was short-lived. In 2002, the Supreme Court of the United States in  held that the relevant portions of the CPPA were unconstitutional because they prevented lawful speech. Referring to Ferber, the court stated that the CPPA prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production. Virtual child pornography is not 'intrinsically related' to the sexual abuse of children.The opinion in Ashcroft included the statement that:Whether or not the films we mention violate the CPPA, they explore themes within the wide sweep of the statute's prohibitions. If these films, or hundreds of others of lesser note that explore those subjects, contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity within the statutory definition, the possessor of the film would be subject to severe punishment without inquiry into the work's redeeming value. This is inconsistent with an essential First Amendment rule: The artistic merit of a work does not depend on the presence of a single explicit scene. See Book Named John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U. S. 413, 419 (1966)Under , it may be a crime for an adult to provide inappropriate sexual content to a child, even if the content is not legally obscene, but this does not apply when both parties to a communication are minors.Text, written words, may be unlawful to distribute if and only if it passes the , making it legally obscene. The wording of the test is:The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, Roth, supra, at 354 U. S. 489, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. If a state obscenity law is thus limited, First Amendment values are adequately protected by ultimate independent appellate review of constitutional claims when necessary. Pp. 413 U. S. 24-25.This test applies whether the subjects are children or adults.I do not know\\ what rules would be applied by the authorities in Sweden. They are likely to be quite different."}

{"question":"Is there any concept in the legal world that covers laws that are too difficult or impractical to comply with?Here's an example; suppose an American moves to the UK and buys a house. The mortgage is for \uffe1300,000, which is equivalent to $300,000 at the time of purchase. However by the time the house is sold, 20 years later, the house is worth \uffe1900,000 and is equivalent to $1,200,000. The owner must now calculate exactly how much money he earned - taking into account the GBP\/USD exchange rate every time there was a mortgage payment. This would require many dozens or possibly hundreds of hours to do, at massive cost (if performed by a tax professional). In the example above, should the owner not properly follow these rules, and perhaps just make some rough estimate, could he be held criminally responsible for filing an incorrect tax return? Or does there exist some kind of defense that complying with the law would simply have been completely unreasonable or impractical?","answer":"Sometimes laws contain exceptions when they are 'unreasonably' burdensome. For example the US 'Americans with Disabilities Act' does not require providing wheelchair access when this would require tearing down a building, or even major structural changes, and only requires that employers provide 'reasonable' accommodations.But the clerical cost of compliance is not usually a reason for an exception.In the case in the question, since the owner does not actually make a profit until the house is sold. it might be sufficient to compute the profit in local currency, and then apply the conversion factor once to the total profit. But even if a separate conversion had to be applied to each separate payment, that is exactly the kind of thing that an app or computer program could do quickly and easily. Nothing says that the computation need be manual.When compliance with a law is impossible or would violate some other law, courts generally hold that the law cannot be enforced, or must be complied with in some alternate way."}

Can I just fill out this application and get back the 10% extra I've been paying on my electricity? I certainly don't use any of my electricity for 'commercial purposes'.I found  from over four years ago that seems to be related, but it doesn't give a final answer either way.","answer":"As it turns out, Talgov has a convoluted way it bills taxes which it doesn't explain on its bills or website.  claims to bill electricity at a rate of $7.59\/month + $0.10522\/kWh but, with taxes, it actually comes to $8.5631 plus $0.11598\/kWh.On top of the advertised rate, it bills a gross receipts tax of 2.56406%. It also bills a public service tax of 10% on the monthly charge + $.07792\/kWh + the gross receipts tax. That gets you the higher effective billing rate I mentioned above. The $.07792\/kWh is reached by replacing the ECRC rate from the website with $.0077\/kWh--I don't know why and I can't find an official document saying this--but that's what is happening apparently.So, Talgov doesn't bill sales tax after all and private residences are not exempt from the taxes it bills. Thus, it has not overcharged me a tax I should be exempt from and Talgov is allowed to do what it is doing, but it would be better if they represented their billing rate more honestly on their website. I'm also still not sure how they reach their 2.56406% gross receipt tax rate. The  that addresses gross receipt tax seems to specify either 2.5% or 2.6% (I can't figure out which should apply), but not something in between:(b)1.?The rate applied to utility services shall be 2.5 percent.2.?The rate applied to communications services shall be 2.37 percent.3.?An additional rate of 0.15 percent shall be applied to communication services subject to the tax levied pursuant to s. 202.12(1)(a), (c), and (d).

Some Florida companies use a 2.5% gross receipt tax and some use a rate between 2.5% and 2.6%. This is also strange because that Florida statute seems to suggest the rate should be uniform statewide.TL;DR: Talgov is not charging sales tax, but rather some other taxes that I am not exempt from. I was able to figure out what rates they were charging for those taxes, but not why."}
{"question":"I was noticing that there are a lot of documentaries from the 1940s and 50s (primarily American) on youtube.

Are they posted legally?","answer":"Life + 70 years' is the duration under current US law, however, copyright in the US has been subject to a large number of  at different times.For WWII vintage works the terms were 28 years from publication if copyright was claimed, if published without a copyright notice then the were immediately public domain. The author could extend the protection for a further 28 years. With the passage of the 1976 law, the second term was automatically extended to 47 years to give existing works the same 75 year protection as new works.Further, the 1998  increased the term to 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication (whichever is earlier) for corporate works.So, for any given WWII documentary it could have:0 years if published without a copyright notice28 years if the extension was never applied for95 years if the extension was applied for.It is quite likely that extensions were not applied for for WWII documentaries as in the 1960-70s when the original term expired the only way to monetise them was through TV broadcast and 30 year old WWII documentaries were unlikely to be at the top of any network's programming schedule."}

Goldberg is quoted in Wikipedia's  as follows:The expression became one of the best-known phrases in the history of the Supreme Court.I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description, and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.11378 U.S. at 197 (Stewart, J., concurring)and Wikipedia's  begins'The exception that proves the rule' (sometimes 'the exception proves the rule') is a saying whose meaning is contested. Henry Watson Fowler's Modern English Usage identifies five ways in which the phrase has been used, and each use makes some sort of reference to the role that a particular case or event takes in relation to a more general rule.Question: I don't mean to invoke the exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis usage, but instead would like to know if Justice Goldbergs words above have been used as an example of something that while it seems to have worked in this case, is an argument that generally shouldn't be used in rulings.In other words, a scholarly version of 'don't try this at home'.I'm looking for citations and examples of scholarly works or other works of law for examples, and definitely not asking for users' opinions as answers. Note that Justice Goldberg also qualified that (re-quoted from the same source):This simple phrase, embedded in a plurality opinion, carries with it many of the conflicts and inconsistencies that continue to plague American obscenity law. In effect, I know it when I see it can still be paraphrased and unpacked as: I know it when I see it, and someone else will know it when they see it, but what they see and what they know may or may not be what I see and what I know, and thats okay.?William T. Goldberg","answer":"If you are asking if 'I know it when I see it' is a popular formally articulated legal standard, it is not.This said, there are myriad circumstances in which the law entrusts a finder of fact (i.e. a judge or a jury as the case may be) with making a legal determination under a broad and general standard with few formal guidelines.So, while the phrase is uncommon in precedent (and doesn't apply in obscenity cases either any longer), a broad grant of discretion that boils down to an opinion based decision is common."}
{"question":"I'm an MBA student working on an assignment to evaluate the feasibility of transitioning from a license-only model to a franchise model. We're fine doing the business analysis, but we do have some legal concerns about what to do with the existing licensees. Grandfather them, drop them, or convert them?Does anyone know of any businesses in the U.S. that have made this type of transition? Or of any case studies on the subject? We would like to be able to address the issue in our paper, rather then just note it as a concern.Thanks","answer":"You can only vary an existing contract in accordance with the terms of the contract (which presumably is silent on this)or with the agreement of both parties and with consideration on both sides i.e. a contract can only be varied by another contract.So:You can dump themYou can grandfather themYou can change them with a new contract"}
{"question":"As far as I can tell the US government, especially the current US President Obama, wants stricter laws concerning the ownership and \/ or acquisition of guns and weapons in the USA.Now again as far as I can tell, there's the general idea in the US that whenever a (foreign) government reduces your potential sales, you can sue them to replace the money that you potentially may have gained. With the (foreign) only applying when there's a free-trade agreement (like TTIP or NAFTA) between the US and the foreign nation in question including investor-protection measures.Now assume Obama convinces the congress to make a law to restrict the acquisition of guns (e.g., more controls for private sales, less people qualified to buy guns in the first place, etc.) or he just signs an Executive Order having the same effect.In this scenario, can every single company that sells \/ produces guns sue the US government because their sales got reduced by this new law \/ executive order?","answer":"It's not coming to mind right now, but I think there is a precedent in agriculture, where a change in laws that alters the method of practicing business can act as the basis for a valid suit.

{"question":"Within the boundaries of the United States there were at various times \"organized incorporated territories\", that were not a part of any of the states and whose governments were organized by acts of Congress rather than by a state constitution drafted by statesmen within the state and enacted by the voters of the state, and that, unlike the states, had no voting representatives or senators in Congress. (Somewhat like the three territories of northern Canada today, I think?) Is the District of Columbia simply an instance of that phenomenon, or is there some essential difference?","answer":" states that The Congress shall have PowerTo exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over suchDistrict (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession ofparticular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat ofGovernment of the United States, and to exercise like Authority overall Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State inwhich the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines,Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildingswhich then happened in  (1790). It is there referred to as a district of territory but more often simply as a district.Unlike territories, its existence for its actual purpose as seat of government is specifically enabled by the Constitution. Then via  (1801), DC was politically brought within the control of Congress, so that residents were no longer residents of Maryland or Virginia. In this act it is consistently termed a district."}

A simple contract may have one written document. A complex contract, say for the construction of a building, may have tens of thousands of documents.** Entering a contract happens when the agreement is made **Once an offer is made and accepted there is a binding contract irrespective of when (or if) any documents are signed.VariationsA contract can only be varied by:a term in the contract that provides for variationanother contract between the partiesFor the changed delivery date to be binding thene there either needs to be a provision in the contract allowing for the delivery data to be changed (and if there are conditions on how it can be changed these must have been followed) ORBy a new contract where each party provided something of value - if the delivery date changed to suit the vendor, what did the buyer get in return? Or vice-versa. Note that consideration does not have to be money, just something of some (even nominal) value.A signature is evidence of agreementA signature is very strong evidence that the person agreed to the terms - in fact it is almost irrefutable evidence.The absence of a signature is evidence of nothing. In the event of a dispute, determining what the terms are will depend on other circumstance - usually the actions of the parties. For example, if you are provided with a contract's terms and then take any action that brings about the contract (e.g. like accepting the goods) then that is evidence that you have accepted the terms."}
{"question":"I'm wondering about the legality of a system like planka.nu (Swedish subway fare dodgers) (More info here: ) as they would be implemented in the USA.

{"question":"In debates about racial discrimination, the strict scrutiny test is applied to ensure that a government law or policy does not infringe on the rights of an individual. Laws and policies can be exempted from this test if they are any of the following:Necessary to perpetuate a compelling interest (national security, avoiding other constitutional concerns)The most narrowly-tailored means of acting towards that interestThe least restrictive means of acting towards that interest.Apparently, despite some legal scholars' consideration of the latter to be a part of the second, SCOTUS still differentiates between them. How?This all comes from Wikipedia's .For example:In a policy regarding university admissions, where the university seeks a certain level of diversity (but not through a quota system!), the university tends to prioritize specific demographics because previous, race-neutral alternatives have sacrificed scholastic aptitude and\/or undermined the diversity of the incoming class.Someone has a problem with this, sues, it goes up the chain to SCOTUS, etc.Now, assuming the university is found to have a compelling interest in demanding diversity, it still seems that the policy's tailoring towards specific demographic is a restriction. Where and how would the court differentiate between the policy's narrowness and restrictiveness?","answer":"This sounds like a semantic question, and the answer is that when the two terms can be brought to bear on the same question they would mean the same thing.E.g., 'affirmative action' could be described as a racist program 'tailored' to extend preference to certain races.  However, one could instead parse a description of affirmative action as a 'restriction' on the rights of those who are not given preference.  Obviously it could simultaneously be declared 'narrowly-tailored to benefit injured classes' and 'the least restrictive way of infringing the rights of the other classes.'(I await any counterexample ;)"}
{"question":"Recently I notice two game in one is appstore and another one is google play store. but there different company but using almost same logo.My question: is there a violation of copyright?. ","answer":"The images as displayed are quite similar, similar enough that one could violate the copyright of the other. But that is not enough to know if there was in fact a copyright infringement. There are several possibilities:Although using different names, the  developers could in fact be the same company.One developer might have obtained permission to use the image from the other.Both images might be based on the same 3rd-party image which both are using with permission.Both images might be based on a public domain image.Copyright is only infringed if a protected work, or a derivative version of the work, is used without permission from the copyright holder. Without knowing who the rights-holder is, and if permission has been obtained, one cannot know if an infringement has occurred.There is no independent or 3rd-party entity that checks for copyright infringements.By the way, the similarity here is close enough that there might also be an issue of trademark infringement. But again, infringement requires use of a protected mark without permission, and so some of the same possibilities arise. (The source of a trademarked logo doe not matter. On the other hand there cannot be trademark infringement unless the mark has been registered, or actually used in commerce. If the same image is used on products in very different industries, say games and hammers, there may or may not be infringement.)"}
{"question":"I've noticed Software SLAs (Service Level Agreements) contain similar language to each other.Question: Is a software SLA considered intellectual property, copyrighted or protected in any way from being copied word-for-word wholly or in part without attribution?I have googled and searched this StackExchange specifically but did not find an appropriate answer, at least as far as I could tell.(Not a lawyer.  Please forgive if this is obvious or if I improperly use any terms.  Scope of this question is US-only.)","answer":"Yes and no. In principle, any document can be subject to copyright protection, as long as it is created by a person within the required time frame. Legal documents may not be, when they were first written in 1659 and have been recycled for centuries: if it worked in 1659, surely it will work now. In the case of a computer service agreement, it is probable that the document is new enough that the original would not have lapsed into the public domains, thus the original is protected. Since this was probably a work for hire, the rights-holder is probably some company. If they were really clever, they may have registered their copyright, in which case all of those other people could be in a world of trouble. Otherwise, there is the problem of establishing the holder of the right. BTW, attribution is mostly irrelevant, what counts most is permission (which may be publicly granted under CC license terms, with the provision that attribution is given)."}

Although it could fall under the broad rubric of the common law tort of assault, that does not necessarily translate to the crime of assault, so there may need to be a separate law passed. There is  then states the penalty  the actual value depends on points assessed against a person for their prior criminal record.

{"question":"I am curious as to whether there is any precedent in the U.S. regarding the level of scrutiny applied to 14th amendment claims against statutes that hinder a person's ability to engage in scientific research. In particular, whether the courts have deemed the right to engage in science as 'inherent in the concept of ordered liberty' or 'deeply rooted in our country's history and tradition.' It seems plausible to me that a case could be made for this, which would raise the level of scrutiny above rational basis.","answer":"There is no body of constitutional law to that effect.In part, this is because the non-constitutional tradition of academic freedom is so great.Once research is done, publication of that research has strong freedom of the press protections under the First Amendment, but there is no real case law suggesting that the scientific inquiry itself is protected.For example, while research universities usually have tenured professors in order to protect their freedom of scientific inquiry, it is not unconstitutional to have a university or research department of a corporation, where everyone is an employee at will.Similarly, cases regarding whether stem cell research should be permitted are not argued in a manner that raises constitutional questions. They are argued based upon statutes allowing or forbidding those practices and administrative law considerations."}

{"question":"As far as I know, when the cases are heard by Federal judiciary, they are first heard by lower level courts, and only get escalated to SCOTUS once appealed from a ruling by a circuit court.Is that the case for 100% of cases? Or are there any situations where SCOTUS is required as first step (either Constitutionally or by statute)?","answer":"Short answer: Yes. There are some matters in the exclusive original jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court, which consists of suits between U.S. states and\/or foreign states with each other and suits involving diplomats. On average, one or two such suits are filed each year.The original jurisdiction in these cases is created by Article III of the United States Constitution (Section 2, Clause 2), and is exclusive in these cases by virtue of the 1789 Judiciary Act. The 11th Amendment also plays a role in this analysis.Long answer:The original jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court is set forth in Article III, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United State Constitution, which states:  In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court  shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before  mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both  as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations  as the Congress shall make.Basically, these are cases of a state against the United States and\/or another state, often regarding boundary disputes, interpretations of interstate compacts, or water rights, or cases involving diplomats adjudicating the extent of diplomatic immunity.(Incidentally, almost all, but not all of the cases in the U.S. Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction are discretionary, but appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court from three judge panels ruling in certain election law cases are of right.)How rare are these suit in the original jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court? On average, the U.S. Supreme Court has considered about one per year on the merits since it came into existence. This has been between 0.5% and 2% of the U.S. Supreme Court's overall caseload of merits cases in modern times. (These days the U.S. Supreme Court typically decides about 70 case a year on the merits and evaluates about 5,000 certiorari petitions each year.)  Between 1789 and 1959, the Court issued written opinions in only 123  original cases. Since 1960, the Court has received fewer than 140  motions for leave to file original cases, nearly half of which were  denied a hearing. The majority of cases filed have been in disputes  between two or more states. The Court has generally accepted state  party cases dealing with boundary and water disputes, but it has been  much less likely to field original cases dealing with contract  disputes and other subjects not deemed sufficiently substantial for  the Court's resources.In practice, when a case in the U.S. Supreme Court's original jurisdiction is filed, it is almost always assigned immediately to a 'special master' who develops the case until it is ready for U.S. Supreme Court review.The U.S. Supreme Court briefly allowed non-residents of a state to sue state governments in its original jurisdiction, but this authority was quickly eliminated by the passage of the 11th Amendment (which has also been interpreted as codifying the principal of a state's sovereign immunity from suits by its own citizens outside its own courts without its consent).  In the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress made the Supreme Court's  original jurisdiction exclusive in suits between two or more states,  between a state and a foreign government, and in suits against  ambassadors and other public ministers. The Supreme Court's  jurisdiction over the remainder of suits to which a state was a party  was to be concurrent, presumably with state courts since the statute  did not expressly confer these cases upon the inferior federal courts.Notably, this exclusivity rule does not apply to suits between a state and the United States, or to suits brought by states against non-residents (whether or not they are U.S. persons), although such suits have been interpreted to be within the original jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court:  In the 1892 case of United States v. Texas , Justice John Marshall  Harlan ruled that since the federal judicial power extended to 'cases  in which the United States was a party,' and the Court was granted  jurisdiction over cases to which a state was a party, the Court would  take jurisdiction in a United States suit against a state. Such suits  by the United States increased after the 1890s and usually involved  disputes with states over land, though in the late twentieth century  they also included a few suits to enforce provisions of the Federal  Voting Rights Act.As a result of the 11th Amendment and the 1789 Judiciary Act, the U.S. District Courts only have jurisdiction over states when they consent to suit in the forum (usually for federal law cases involving bankruptcies), or when the United States is a party and no private individuals are parties (as in the federal district court case Arizona v. United States mentioned in the comments) since U.S. District Courts have jurisdiction over all suits to which the United States is a party. U.S. District Court jurisdiction is limited, however, by doctrines of state sovereign immunity, to  (although this is circumvented, in part, by bringing suits against state officials as opposed to state governments themselves). So basically, states themselves can only be sued in U.S. District Courts by the United States for injunctive relief under the 14th Amendment. (For this purpose, unlike many other purposes under the U.S. Constitution, the term 'state' does not include local governments which can be sued in federal court, and often are sued there for civil rights violations.)Also, despite the seemingly mandatory nature of the U.S. Supreme Court's original jurisdiction, it .   The Supreme Court further limited its original docket by declaring  that it would exercise discretion over whether to hear cases even if  they were legitimately within the Court's jurisdiction. In a series of  cases in 1971, including Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp ., the Court  declined to hear environmental pollution claims brought by states  against corporations that dealt with complex and technical factual  questions. The justices ruled that the states had other available  forums to bring their claims and that the cases were not 'appropriate'  for the Court in light of its primary function as the nation's highest  appellate tribunal. The Court resolved to examine the 'seriousness and  dignity' of claims so as to preserve its resources for consideration  of appeals involving federal questions. The Supreme Court soon  expanded its appropriateness doctrine to decline to hear some cases  between two states, even where the Court's jurisdiction was exclusive.The U.S. Supreme Court also has the statutory authority (almost never used) under the  are filed directly in the U.S. Supreme Court in its original jurisdiction each year, although very few are granted. The text of the All Writs Act is as follows:  (a) The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress  may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their  respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of  law.    (b) An alternative writ or rule nisi may be issued by a justice or  judge of a court which has jurisdiction.According to Wikipedia (with appropriate citation to authority):  Application of the All Writs Act requires the fulfillment of four  conditions:    The absence of alternative remediesthe act is only applicable when  other judicial tools are not available.    An independent basis for jurisdictionthe act authorizes writs in aid  of jurisdiction, but does not in itself create any federal  subject-matter jurisdiction.    Necessary or appropriate in aid of jurisdictionthe writ must be  necessary or appropriate to the particular case.    Usages and principles of lawthe statute requires courts to issue  writs 'agreeable to the usages and principles of law'."}

{"question":"The Olio Model One is a smartwatch sold from 2015 to 2016 by Olio Devices, Inc. The Olio watches were rather expensive, with a price range from $595 to $1,395. Furthermore, to work, the Olio needs to be able to talk to a specific API server; without this API server, the companion smartphone app will not function, and without the smartphone app the watch itself will not function.Olio Devices was acquired by Flex, Ltd. in early 2017, after which they never sold anymore Olio watches; apparently Flex acquired Olio Devices just to use Olio's technology in their own products. In addition to ceasing the sale of Olio watches, Flex also shut down the API server I mentioned above later in 2017, resulting in most Olio watches losing almost all of their functionality. Neither the former employees of Olio Devices nor Flex gave any solution to this; customers were expected to live with their $595-$1395 paperweights.Under United States consumer protection law (Olio Devices was founded and headquartered in California and Flex has offices throughout the US), can Flex be sued for this, either for payouts or for a solution to make the Olio watch work again? If so, is there a time frame in which such lawsuits would need to be filed?","answer":"There are multiple thorny legal questions and factual questions that would need to be resolved to get an answer. An effective remedy for the consumers against Olio Devices would be challenging, but not impossible to prevail in, and an effective remedy against Flex would be considerably harder to prevail in.The first thing you would need to know is how the sale of Olio Devices to Flex was structured. If Flex truly merged as a corporate entity with Olio Devices, or if Olio Devices purchased the Flex entity and then changed its name to Flex, there would be liability from the consumer to Flex is a cause of action could be established.But, if Flex merely purchased selected assets from Olio Devices for cash, any liability would run from the consumer to Olio Devices, and would be limited to the cash received by Olio Devices in the deal.If that cash was insufficient to pay liabilities owed by Olio Devices to its consumers, in order to prevail against Flex, the consumers would have to establish that the sale to Flex of its assets was a fraudulent transfer which doesn't necessarily require proof that there was an actual intent to defraud, but does require a showing that (1) the total liabilities of Olio Devices (including contingent future liabilities) exceeded the value of its assets at the time of the sale, (2) that Olio Devices did not receive substantially equivalent value for the assets it sold to Flex, (3) that the sale was not ratified by a bankruptcy court if Olio Devices was in bankruptcy, and (4) that the sale of assets from Olio Devices to Flex took place more than four years before the lawsuit seeking to set aside the fraudulent transfer. Alternately, the statute of limitations could be longer, the threshold of proof could be lower, and punitive damages up to 50% of the recovery otherwise available, if there was an actual intent to defraud the consumers of Olio Devices in the sale of assets transaction that could be established.It is also possible that Olio Devices was kept intact as an entity, whose shareholders were now a parent company, and the parent company didn't take any assets out of the subsidiary, which would make it hard to sue the parent company.Of course, all of this hinges on whether there is an underlying case against Olio Devices.Assuming that the watches were sold in 2015 and 2016 without an intent to defraud at that time, one would have to determine what the nature of the contractual arrangement for post-sale service by Olio Devices was with respect to those watches. This would not be an elementary matter and would take review of relevant documents (e.g. warranties and license agreements) and consideration of case law in other circumstances that might be relevant regarding implied contractual terms. The outcome of that would be a close question. If the contract didn't have such a term, or expressly disavowed such liability, then the next question would be whether the absence of such term would render the contract unconscionable causing a term like that to be implied in law.Assuming that the consumers established that there was an implied contractual term that the watches would be supported by Olio Devices indefinitely, the next question would be when the statute of limitations started to accrue. Generally speaking, this happens when there is a breach of the contract and that breach is known to the consumer, which would probably happen in late 2017. The  for a breach of a written contract is four years, and for an oral contract is two years, but I don't know what the relevant statute of limitations would be in the case of a contractual term implied in law or in fact.There might be a consumer protection law specific provision, intertwined with the implied contractual term, but my guess is that this is unlikely.All of the relevant questions would arise primarily under state law. The law that would apply would again be fact specific. Normally a contract to enter into a sale of goods is governed by the state where the sale takes place and runs between the seller and the buyer, who would often not be the underlying manufacturer, so the warranty or license or service contract from the underlying manufacturer might be the controlling document and would usually have a choice of law provision which would probably choose California law as the governing law.It is also conceivable that this issue could be framed as a product liability issue with the product being defective because it relied upon a service that could be discontinued. This liability would run directly from the consumer to Olio Devices. The statute of limitations in California for a products liability lawsuit involving personal property is generally three years.Realistically, the only economic way to bring any economic lawsuit would be via a class action lawsuit, but if any contract or license running from Olio Devices directly to the consumer contained an arbitration clause (which it is quite likely that it would) then a class action lawsuit would probably be barred and an arbitration proceeding would have to be commenced instead.So, there are facts not present in the question that are necessary to provide an accurate answer, but the clock is definitely ticking and many theories of relief are likely to be barred some time in 2020 or 2021 depending upon the theory, and some causes of action may already be time barred.Of course, if this happened in 2017, it is very likely that someone already did bring a lawsuit, which may have been settled, resolved in arbitration proceedings, or resolved in a class action proceedings that was concluded or is still pending. If there was a class settlement of such a lawsuit, it may still be possible to apply to receive a payment under that settlement. It would be surprising for someone to wait until now to sue, if there were many thousands of units sold that were rendered useless and there was a viable litigation option. Somebody would almost surely have investigated the matter before then and there are multiple law firms in California that specialize in these kinds of lawsuits and usually figure out opportunities for lawsuits first and recruit clients second.Other Factual BackgroundFactual background .Data on the sale of the company\/assets .The most valuable asset of Olio Devices was probably .It appears that the purchase price was "}

Similarly, back in the bushfire crisis of 2019 (it's been a good few years, hasn't it?), the Navy was used to evacuate communities cut off by fire.What law allows the ADF to be used in this way?Who has command of the operation?What powers do ADF personnel have in interacting with the population?","answer":"What law allows the ADF to be used in this way?Part IIIAAA of the  2003 (Cth) enables Calling out the Defence Force to protect Commonwealth interests, States and self?governing Territories.It allows the Govenor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence and the Attorney-General to make a call-out order. This may be at the request of the executive government of a State against domestic violence under s119 of the Constitution (or to protect the state from foreign invasion without such a request).Now, the domestic violence envisioned by the Constitution is not how the term is used today: it means civil disorder, insurrection, rebellion, breakdown of law and order etc. However, because the current usage is so prevalent, I cannot find any case law on how or if this term has been interpreted.However,  1998 Parliamentary Research Paper concluded:there are legal difficulties inherent in nearly all uses of the defence forces for 'non-defence' purposessuccessive Commonwealth Governments have used the defence forces without prior consideration of the legal steps involvedthe defence forces have often responded to requests without regard for their own operational instructions, andon a legal basis, the deployed troops are found to be largely unprotected.However, this report predates 60 subsequent amendments to the Act including the Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Act 2018 which completely rewrote Part IIIAAA, so this conclusion is probably no longer valid.Notwithstanding, given the temper of the Australian judiciary, it is highly likely that the courts would defer to the discretion of a State government in deciding what was and what was not domestic violence.Who has command of the operation?As far as reasonably practicable, the Chief of the Defence Force must assist, and cooperate with, the police force of a State or Territory that is affected by a call out of the Defence Force.Further s40(1)(b) requires that the Defence Force is not utilised for any particular task in any of those States and Territories (except in relation to airborne aircraft) unless a member of the police force of that State or Territory requests that the Defence Force be so utilised.However, s40(3) is clear that the law does not require or permit the Chief of the Defence Force to transfer to any extent command of the Defence Force to a State or Territory, or to a police force or member of the police force of that State or Territory.So, Defence Force Personal operate under their own, independent command but can only do so when requested by police.What powers do ADF personnel have in interacting with the population?s46 gives Defence Force personnel the following powers if the Minister of Defence has authorised them (which they normally does) or if the Defence Force personnel reasonably believe they have been authorised:(5) The member may take any one or more of the following actions:(a)  capture or recapture a location (including a facility) or thing;(b)  prevent, or put an end to:(i)  acts of violence; or(ii)  threats to any persons life, health or safety, or to public health or public safety;(c)  protect any persons from:(i)  acts of violence; or(ii)  threats to any persons life, health or safety, or to public health or public safety;(d)  take measures (including the use of force) against an aircraft (whether or not the aircraft is airborne) or vessel, up to and including destroying the aircraft or vessel (subject to subsection (6));(e)  give an order relating to the taking of measures referred to in paragraph (d) of this subsection (subject to subsection (6))....(7)  The member may, in connection with taking any action mentioned in subsection (5), do any one or more of the following:(a)  free any hostage from a location (including a facility) or thing;(b)  control the movement of persons or of means of transport;(c)  evacuate persons to a place of safety;(d)  search persons, locations or things for things that may be seized, or persons who may be detained, in relation to the call out order;(e)  seize any thing found in the search that the member believes on reasonable grounds is a thing that may be seized in relation to the call out order;(f)  detain any person found in the search that the member believes on reasonable grounds is a person who may be detained in relation to the call out order for the purpose of placing the person in the custody of a member of a police force at the earliest practicable time;(g)  provide security (whether or not armed, and whether or not with a police force) including by patrolling or securing an area or conducting cordon operations;(h)  direct a person to answer a question put by the member, or to produce to the member a particular document that is readily accessible to the person, (including by requiring the person to provide identification to the member);(i)  operate, or direct a person to operate, a facility, machinery or equipment (including electronic equipment) in a particular manner (whether or not the facility, machinery or equipment is on a facility or means of transport)....(9)  The member may do anything incidental to anything in subsection (5) or (7), including enter any place or premises or board an aircraft or vessel."}
{"question":"Let's say a minor (17 or younger) living with his parents gets a job or does chores, and with the money thereby earned, buys a video game console.The parents decide that the console is not appropriate for the child and take it away. In fact, they sell it and put the money into their own bank account, with no plans to ever give it back to the child.Setting aside any question of ethics or morality, is this legal on the part of the parents? If the police are called in, will they seek to charge the parents with a crime (such as theft)?I am under the impression that there is no legal case here, as the parents are the custodians\/guardians of everything for the child. Imagine a situation where the parents are very poor, and ongoingly need the fruits of their child's labor to simply put food on the table and pay for the electricity. In my mind, while parents should generally allow their children to own possessions and enjoy the fruits of their labor, they also have every right to take every last penny from their child if it is urgently needed for the basic good of the whole family.When considering this situation, perhaps it would be easier for you to think of the purchased item as something most would agree is unhealthful for the child, though not necessarily illegal for him to possesssay, a book on how to construct a bomb or on how to commit suicide. Perhaps it is a chain saw, or a gun, or a set of lawn darts, or pornography, or anything else that most\/many people would recognize is good for parents to take away from their minor children, no matter where the money came from or what previous recognition there was in the family of the item's belonging to the child. In this way, please try to avoid responding from any distaste about the parents violating your personal feelings about a child's rights, as this question is specifically about the law only.I'd like to know if my impression here stands at odds with any laws or precedents that could inform me better.If a more specific jurisdiction is needed, let's hear answers from Washington state, California, Florida, and Maine. Or chime in with a few other states, so we can get an idea of what the laws are throughout the nation. Feel free to add information on laws in other countries, as well, but please try to answer the USA question first.","answer":"The fundamental question is whether children can own property: they clearly can. See  (I improved the link so it can be more easily read).  As a general rule any property acquired by the child in any way except  by its own labor or services belongs to the child, and not to the  parentMcClosky v. Cyphert, 3 Casey (27 Pa.) 220  The right of an infant to be the owner of property is as clear and as  well protected as that of a person who has arrived at full age. When  anything is given to an infant to be held by him in his own right, he  has the title to it, and the parent, guardian or master has in law no  more right to take it (for any purpose beyond safekeeping) than a  stranger.Wheeler v. R. Co., 31 Kan. 640, 3 P. 297, 300:  As a matter of law a minor may own property the same as any other  person. He may obtain it by inheritance, by gift, or by purchase; and  there is nothing in the law that would prevent even a father from  giving property to his minor child. A father may also so emancipate  his minor child as to entitle him to receive his own wages. It is  probably true that where a minor child lives with his father, and is  supported by him, all things given to the child in the way of support,  such as clothing, for instance, would still belong to the father and  not to the child. But things given by the father to the child, not in  the way of support, but with the understanding that they should become  the property of the child, would, undoubtedly, become the property of  the child.Banks v. Conant, 14 Allen 497, the father  has no title to the property of the child, nor is the capacity or  right of the latter to take property or receive money by grant, gift  or otherwise, except as a compensation for services, in any degree  qualified or limited during minority. Whatever therefore an infant  acquires which does not come to him as a compensation for services  rendered, belongs absolutely to him, and his father cannot interpose  any claim to it, either as against the child, or as against third  persons who claim title or possession from or under the infant.However, a parent does have the right to prevent their child from using or acquiring a computer, car (also prohibited statutorily in Washington), television, cell phone; they can also prevent a child from spending their savings. Parents do retain their property right in things that they give to their children for general support and maintenance, such as a pair of shoes, or books. There can also be specific statutes such as the  (Washington version) which partially recognize this right, making it easy for a person to transfer property to a minor, where the property is in the care of a custodian, but not owned by the custodian."}
{"question":"If I take a piece of software that is licensed as MIT (quoted at the end), and use it as a scaffold to create for my own thing, do I need to keep including the old license perpetually? This would seem ridiculous (although the law may see it differently), as I could potentially change (in actual meaning, rather than just rewriting the same logic but with different terms) every line of code and it would cease to have anything to do with the original author.If I am correct, than at what point does the old author cease to retain copyright\/the license ceases to hold?In either case, at some points I would have made enough changes to warrant copyrighting them as well. How does one indicate which portions are under copyright by the old author and which are under mine?I am interested mainly in answers from the perspective of US\/common law.  I understand that not all of these questions might have been tested in court, so a philosophical answer would suffice.As a concrete example regarding which to test\/explain, I would propose the 'software' to be a style sheet for website. These are composed of relatively similar statements describing how different elements should look\/behave (i.e. font size, font color, placement, etc., so if two people were to style the same element, there is a high probability that they would get at least some of the statements to coincide). Finally, bonus points for explaining the relevant parts with regards to GPL(v2).

How does one indicate which portions are under copyright by the old author and which are under mine?Under the terms of the MIT licence, you can claim copyright on your work but you are required to grant a licence to anyone and everyone on the same terms as the MIT licence so there is little point to doing so. Adding your name to the Copyright line will give you the right of attribution.If you want to indicate which points are yours, you can pepper the code with comments indicating this but so long as the fact that this is a joint work of you and the original author is noted then it is not necessary.

{"question":"When looking for the Helvetica font, it usually costs you a certain amount of money because it is not a free font. But when I am using the free open source software LaTeX, I can use the font wherever I want. But I cannot, for example, use it when writing documents in Word or OpenOffice.Why is that? What kind of special deal or treatment is this?","answer":"Font shapes are not legally protected, whereas font names are. As such, one can make copies of fonts and give them new names. Helvetica is one of the 'base' fonts included in PostScript printers. This made having a 'desktop' version very desirable. Some years ago, the font foundry URW made their Helvetic clone (Nimbus Sans) available under an open license. This allowed the font files to be included in open source software distributions, including LaTeX set ups, with no fee or legal restrictions. Subsequently, these font files have been used as the basis for the 'TeX Gyre' fonts: see  for background.The TeX Gyre fonts are available in OpenType format, and so can be used with (for example) OpenOffice (technically and legally). Note that these fonts are 'metric compatible' with the 'parents', i.e. they can be used directly as replacements for Helvetica, etc. with no change to the appearance of documents."}

{"question":"Everything about the US legal system is based on police lineups and a unanimous decision by 12 of your peers.But surfing a popular physics website I stumbled across   'Under ancient Jewish law, if a suspect on trial was unanimously found guilty by all judges, then the suspect was acquitted. This reasoning sounds counterintuitive, but the legislators of the time had noticed that unanimous agreement often indicates the presence of systemic error in the judicial process, even if the exact nature of the error is yet to be discovered. They intuitively reasoned that when something seems too good to be true, most likely a mistake was made.'And then the article just gets even more surprising from there.This isn't a winger website, this is proven scientific material which is either peer reviewed or will be very soon.I am curious what kind of an impact a talented attorney could have with this kind of material?How flawed are we really?","answer":"First 'everything in the legal system' is much, much more than 'police lineups and a unanimous decision by 12 of your peers'. For a start, police are rarely involved in civil litigation and even in criminal matters lineups are unusual - in most criminal cases there is no doubt who should be charged. However, this is tangential to your questions.I am curious what kind of an impact a talented attorney could have with this kind of material?File it as a historical curiosity. Ancient Jewish law has much less relevance to modern US law than modern North Korean law does; and since that has two tenths of bugger all I guess about one tenth?How flawed are we really?Incredibly flawed. Even setting aside the possibility of corruption; court decisions are influenced by things like when the judge last ate, how long it has been since juror number 4 had sex and if the defence attorney fought with his wife that morning.Focusing on the relatively simple matter of guilt or innocence; that is simple when compared with sentencing or damages, it is The error rate for false acquittals should be considerably higher because of the presumption of innocence and the burden of beyond reasonable doubt, however, most defence lawyers would agree that the mere fact that their client is sitting in the box has them half convicted before the jury is empaneled. However, none of that is something you can argue in court. The system is what the system is. How it is and why it is is a matter of politics (and historical inertia) not law."}
{"question":"I've been in a few niche online forums and chat rooms that specifically forbid their members from discussing anything about the rates they offer as contractors. Some claim it's price fixing and outright illegal, others that it's too gray of an area they just don't want to be anywhere near.I can see where they're coming from: various descriptions of price fixing I can find on google seem to use broad strokes, suggesting any coordination intended to affect market value of a service amounts to the crime. But then I also see professionals talking about it on bigger social media platforms like Twitter, encouraging their peers to price themselves higher (apparently it's common for newer software contractors in particular to undervalue their services and underestimate their costs). These comments, often turning into extended conversations mentioning specific numbers, don't seem to have any problems.Where between explicit market manipulation and well-meaning mentorship is the line drawn?","answer":"Under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, there has to be an agreement for there to be price fixing. If the parties do not agree to engage in price-fixing or other anti-competitive behavior, there is no violation. There does not needed to be a written, explicit contract memorializing the agreement, but there does need to be more than just encouragement to change prices. Telling one person to charge more isn't price-fixing, because the person making the suggestion could then just leave his own prices in place and enjoy the competitive advantage. But if that person were to say, 'We should raise our prices,' and then they both did, you'd probably have a pretty good Sherman Act case. "}

Political campaigns routinely buy such lists and use them to organize door-to-door campaigning, as well as postal appeals.Some years ago I was a (losing) candidate for local office in NJ. I bought such a list covering the township I was running in. It showed each voter's name, address, age, party of registration, if any, and which of the last several elections the person had voted in. I think the lists were available from the board of elections, and local lists from municipal clerks. Exact procedures no doubt differ from state to state, as will costs.

Given that and the fact that there were probably several other ways for the child to have been rescued which would not have involved the death of the gorilla, is there a legal basis for charges to be brought up against the responsible party or could they reasonably argue that it fell under defense?","answer":"The relevant (criminal) defence is Sec 11(b)(3) [the Civil defence in Sec 11(a)(iii) is an easier one]:  (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, it shall be a defence to prosecution under this subsection if the defendant committed the offense based on a good faith belief that he was acting to protect himself or herself, a member of his or her family, or any other individual, from bodily harm from any endangered or threatened species.I would say that the defendant could easily demonstrate a 'good faith belief that he was acting to ... any other individual, from bodily harm from any endangered or threatened species.' Even if there were other ways to rescue the child other than lethal force to the gorilla they all would have necessitated exposing the child to a longer period of danger, exposing another person to danger or may have had less predictable outcomes (e.g. tranquilisers have an onset time) all of which would be unconscionable."}

{"question":"For example, maker community builds a machine implying\/related to technologies\/concepts under patent, and licenses these under GPL.What are the consequences?Example:  community effort.","answer":"I've answered this in the context of US patent law, but similar principles apply elsewhere in the world.As stated in 35 USC 271, 'whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent'. Thus, a patent provides the patent owner with the right to exclude others from performing these actions, and the right to sue anyone who does perform these actions (both to stop them from infringing the patent, and to collect monetary damages for their infringement).Creating an infringing product and then licensing it under the GPL (or any other scheme) does not change the fact that it infringes a patent.35 USC 271 also states that 'Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer'. This means that, even if the creator of the infringing product does not perform any infringing acts in the US, the act of offering it for free use could be construed as induced infringement of the patent, and they could still be sued for that infringement."}

An amended version of the law which did not specify the sex of the related parties in banning uncle\/aunt\/nephew\/niece incest would not raise Constitutional issues, so the court may accept that the state can use a general ban on same-sex marriage to ban the specific case of same-sex marriage between sufficiently related defendants.

It occurred to me after that the fence would have been at the edge of the Canadian landowners property, and the land between the fence and the border was a road allowance on crown land for a road that is yet to be built or may or may not be built.Looking East at the border marker between Toole County, Montana and Warner County, Alberta ().Later that day we met the Rancher who owned the land on the Montana side, he was out herding some stray cattle on his quad, rode over to say hi and we had a friendly chat about the Elk herd that crosses back and forth across the border to and from the Sweetgrass hills. I didn't ask him about it, but it was pretty obvious that he didn't have a fence on the border of his land, and instead relied on the fence 25m inside of Canada to prevent his Cattle from emigrating. Supposing there's a road allowance on the USA side, this guy is potentially ranching on a strip of land up to 50m wide and a few miles long which doesn't belong to him, half of which is in another country. If the Canadian rancher were to suddenly tear down his fence, it would force the USA rancher to put up one on his side, which would potentially lose him about 20 acres of grazing land per mile of fence (10 acres in Canada, and another 10 in USA if he has to leave room for a road allowance).What are the legalities here? Obviously the Montana rancher is using Canadian land, but where is his fence supposed to be? Should it be right on the border? Or is there a strip of land there which is national land reserved for border patrol purposes?","answer":"  It occurred to me after that the fence would have been at the edge of the Canadian landowners property and the land between the fence and the border was a road allowance on crown land.This is one possibility, others are:The border post is in the wrong placeThe fence is in the wrong placeBoth are in the wrong placeThe US rancher owns land in Canada as well as the US  Obviously the Montana Rancher is using Canadian land, but where is his fence supposed to be?Well, its not so obvious but anyway: Who says he has to have one? I am not aware of a law that requires a person to fence their property.  Should it be right on the border?Assuming that is the edge of his land (which it might not be, see above) and assuming he wants to put a fence up (which he might not want to do) and assuming that he wants to put it on the edge of his property (because he could put it inside if he wants to) then yes.  Or is there a strip of land there which is national land reserved for border patrol purposes?You don't know, I don't know - if you are really keen land ownership is public information; check with the governments of Alberta and Montana."}
{"question":"I have a contract that says contractor will be paid X for providing services, is that per pay period, per month, or for the term of the gig?","answer":"If the contract says you will be paid X for providing the services, without further elaboration, it contemplates a single lump sum payment."}
{"question":"After a number of years together, an unmarried couple in a no-common-law-marriage state decide to consolidate households.  The apartment renter (say $1000\/mo) will move into the other's mortgaged house (say $2000\/mo mortgage).  They decide 1) to split the savings, which amounts to the rent on the apartment, thus the non-owner will contribute half of that rent ($500) towards the mortgage\/taxes\/whathaveyou, 2) split the utilities, and 3) the owner will always be 100% sole owner regardless of developments.  While the owner doesn't want a contract, the non-owner is willing and thinks a contract is a very good idea for the benefit of the owner.How might a cohabitation contract benefit the non-owner in the event that 1) the relationship ends disagreeably, and 2) the relationship continues but a lawsuit is filed against one or the other by a third party?(Note .)","answer":"Ownership of real property often carries obligations to local or national bodies, such as property taxes (which are paid to local government).Being an owner of the property puts that obligation on you. Depending on the structure of the tax law, owners may be obligated by proportion (you own x% of the house, you owe x% of the tax) or they may be obligated 'jointly and severally' (everybody owes the taxes together, it can be - and sometimes is - taken from the first person the claimant is able to get their legal process hands on).Contractual disavowment of any ownership interest relieves you of that tax obligation, at least."}
{"question":"Assume a member of the government murdered another individual over some unrelated matter. The attacker is an important member of the US government, so the President classifies this information. Now, if one person tries to reveal this information in order to get justice, would the person who committed the crime get charged or would the person using classified material get charged with a crime like Snowden or both?","answer":"There are a number of reasons why the issue you identify wouldn't come up under the hypothetical facts presented, the first and foremost of which is that the President does not have the power to classify information related to a murder simply because it involves an important member of the U.S. government.There is such a thing as a 'state secrets privilege', however, which can be used to dismiss litigation which cannot reasonably proceed without disclosure of state secrets. This privilege was first officially recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 (1953), and the fact pattern of that case is typical of the kind of circumstances where it might be asserted.  in that case:  A military airplane, a B-29 Superfortress bomber, crashed. The widows  of three civilian crew members sought accident reports on the crash  but were told that to release such details would threaten national  security by revealing the bomber's top-secret mission. The court held  that only the government can claim or waive the privilege, but that it  is not to be lightly invoked and that there must be a formal claim  of privilege, lodged by the head of the department which has control  over the matter, after actual personal consideration by that officer.  The court stressed that the decision to withhold evidence is to be  made by the presiding judge and not the executive.    In 2000, the accident reports were declassified and released, and it  was found that the assertion that they contained secret information  was fraudulent. The reports did, however, contain information about  the poor condition of the aircraft itself, which would have been very  compromising to the Air Force's case. Many commentators have alleged  government misuse of secrecy in this landmark case.The Reynolds case involved a deadly accident occurring on an allegedly secret national security mission, rather than a crime (e.g. an alleged murder over claimed infidelity between soldiers on a secret mission, or a 'fragging' incident in which subordinate soldiers kill their commanding officer because they disapprove of the way he has led them). But, the states secrets privilege could also probably be used to shut down a state criminal case in which national security secrets would have to be available to one or the other party for there to be a fair trial in a similar manner.In the case of a hypothetical federal criminal case, it would not be necessary to invoke the state secrets privilege, because the U.S. federal government could simply decline to prosecute such a case, or could dismiss a case that it had initiated by exercising prosecutorial discretion.  Now, if one person tries to reveal this information in order to get  justice, would the person who committed the crime get charged or would  the person using classified material get charged with a crime like  Snowden or both?It depends upon who wants to reveal the information and how it is obtained. As a strong general rule, only government officials and contractors with security clearances are legally obligated to not disclose classified material. A person without a security clearance generally has no legal obligation not to disclose classified material even if it was obtained from someone with a security clearance who violated the law by leaking the material in the United States.Likewise, if the information in classified material was generated independently of government officials charged with protecting its secrecy, for example, with statements from third-party witnesses who were not legally bound to protect national security secrets, this too would be lawful.There are isolated instances when someone who has not voluntarily agreed to protect classified materials in order to get a security clearance can be obligated to maintain the secrecy of these materials. But, generally speaking, this obligation is limited, for example, to a legal duty not to disclose that a person has received a 'national security letter' (i.e. basically a secret subpoena) from the government under the Patriot Act.Still, even then, the duty is limited to not disclosing affirmative government acts directed at the person involuntarily prohibited from disclosing them, rather than a general duty not to disclosed information that is present in classified materials, or to not disclose classified materials generally.The other main circumstance when there is a duty on the part of someone without a security clearance not to disclose information that is classified involves restrictions on the dissemination of technologies with military applications, especially cryptography related technologies and techniques. But, this would apply to the circumstances of an otherwise relatively ordinary murder only in the most contrived fact patterns. Usually, disclosing the existence of or the detailed workings of a classified technology is not necessary to resolve a murder case.The U.S., in all of the respected above where disclosure of classified material or information contained in classified material is lawful is something of an outlier. It holds this outlier position largely because of its very strong protections of the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press and the freedom to petition government officials which is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (and made applicable to state and local government officials via the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution).On the other hand, there are scenarios in which someone revealing classified materials would be guilty of a crime. One example is that it would be a crime for someone with a security clearance to reveal classified materials that they are charged with protecting. The relevant law even prohibits disclosing or confirming facts in classified materials that have already been made widely known to the public through the media or otherwise, that have not been officially declassified. This was the crime  was prosecuted for violating, since he was a government contractor and former government employee with a security clearance who leaked classified materials.It would also be a crime to pay someone with a security clearance to violate their legal duty not to disclose classified information (which would be a type of bribery) or to threaten someone with a security clearance to cause them to violate their legal duty not to disclose classified material (which would a type of extortion).Likewise, is someone burglarized a government facility and stole or copied classified material in the process, or made an unauthorized hack into a government or government contractor computer system to obtain the classified material, that would also be a crime. It would also be a crime to solicit the services of someone, for pay or otherwise, to obtain classified information in this manner.Both of these things, if done on behalf of, or for the benefit of, a hostile foreign government, would constitute the crime of espionage as well.It is also not a crime for someone who suspects but cannot prove that there was foul play, to say so in the media and to petition government officials including legislative and executive branch officials, to seek justice for the victim of the suspected foul play."}
{"question":"I was researching duty to report a crime, and saw that Ohio was one of the few places that had a general duty to report.

{"question":"When is a summary a derivative work such that it needs the fair use defense to be legal?  For example, consider the following:Farm boy fights evil empire.I don't think that this summary of the original Star Wars trilogy would count as a derivative work, since it it can be used to describe more works of fiction than just Star Wars.  So, is a summary being specific enough that it only describe one specific work sufficient for it to a derivative work?  Necessary but not sufficient?  Or what? (Or if my question is meaningless\/pointless, please explain why.)NOTE: I am NOT asking about when a summary is infringing.  I'm only asking when a summary is a derivative work, regardless of whether or not it's infringing.","answer":"Ultimately whether one work is derivative of another is a question of fact, and there is no absolute rule beyond taking it to a court. Many cases are clear. A Full translation is obviously a derivative work,The definition in  is:A derivative work is a work based upon one or more preexistingworks, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, artreproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which awork may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting ofeditorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or othermodifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work ofauthorship, is a derivative work.A mere description of a work, such as a one-paragraph summary, is probably not a derivative work, but as the summary gets longer and fuller, it starts to approach an abridgment or condensation. One test is if the summery could reasonably replace the original, at least for some consumers. But there is no clear cut place to draw the line.By the way, If something is a derivative work, it is infringing provided only that the original is in copyright and the creator of the derivative did not have permission from, the copyright holder on the original. Fair use may prevent an adverse judgement, but is still an infringement.As the question referred to fair use, a strictly US legal concept, I am assuming US law here."}
{"question":"A civil statute of limitations applies to a non-criminal legal action,including a tort or contract case.[5] If the statute of limitationsexpires before a lawsuit is filed, the defendant may raise the statuteof limitations as an affirmative defense to seek dismissal of thecharge. The exact time period depends on both the state and the typeof claim (contract claim, personal injury, fraud etc.).

Assume the plaintiff is in the United States in California.","answer":"Does the statute of limitations apply if the company to be sued wasn't operating in the U.S.?If the company is not operating in the USA then, of course, US law does not apply to it. There may be statutes of limitations where it is operating but the US ones are irrelevant.However, the company you describe which is entering into a contract with a California resident to provide goods or services in California is most definitely operating in California. The fact that it doesn't have a physical presence in California doesn't mean it's not operating there.If you wish to bring an action in California, the Californian statute of limitations will most definitely apply and time will run from when the breach of contract occurred.You are suffering under the misapprehension that you can't sue a foreign company in a US courtYou can.It's technically more complicated and there can be disputes over jurisdiction, the appropriate venue and which law applies but assuming all of that can be managed and a Californian court has jurisdiction and considers itself the most appropriate venue (it may be that a Chinese court is more appropriate) then there's no reason why you can't sue a foreign company with no physical presence in California."}

I convince them it's a good thing to do and no harm will come, basically ensure they aren't guilty of the intent I have when I trick them into doing something.Would using a na?ve third party allow both the third party and me to get away with the action, since the person doing it lacks mens rea and the law doesn't explicitly make tricking someone else a crime?  Or am I still considered to have committed the crime despite using a third party as an intermediary?I'll accept answers for any common law location, though I'm mildly more interested in USA.","answer":"<h3>General intent is usually enough<\/h3>I believe you are largely conflating motive and intent (see generally R. v. Hibbert, ). For most crimes, there is no need to intend a particular outcome or to have a specific reason for doing the actus reus.Take assault, for example (Criminal Code, ). The mens rea for the simplest variant of this crime is intention: intention to apply force to another person.If you convince another person to apply force to another person, they will still have intentionally applied force to another person. That means they will have had the mens rea for assault. It is no defence for them that you told them to apply the force or told them that it was okay.<h3>Party liability<\/h3>You would also be guilty as a party to that offence, via counselling ().<h3>Some crimes do require specific (ulterior) intent or knowledge of certain facts<\/h3>Some crimes are defined in a way where knowledge and specific intent does matter.  for example, requires that the accused makes a false document, knowing it to be false, with intent... that it should in any way be used or acted on as genuine.If you merely direct someone to make a false document, they will not have the required mens rea.

There is also the standalone offence of using or possessing or trafficking a forged document (which also has a knowledge requirement)."}
{"question":"There has been a lot of cries for social media platforms to be regulated as common carriers.However, what would be the actual, concrete events that must happen for such a thing to happen?Does it require an explicit act of congress, for social media platforms to be regulated as common carriers?Can someone who has been extensively deplatformed, eg. Trump, Alex Jones or Laura Loomer, file a lawsuit arguing that social media platforms are important enough such that they must be regulated as common carriers. And then the Supreme court basically legislates from the bench a la Obergefell?","answer":"However, what would be the actual, concrete events that must happen for [common carrier classification] to happen?Congress would have to pass such laws, since social media platforms are currently covered by a different set of rules. In particular, the Telecommunication Act's concept of information services is a far better fit for social media websites than the common carrier concept. If the FCC were to unilaterally reclassify social media platforms as common carriers, that would be a difficult to defend position. It is also likely that other laws that require some content filtering would need to be updated or removed.Can someone who has been extensively deplatformed [\u2026] file a lawsuit arguing that social media platforms are important enough such that they must be regulated as common carriers. And then the Supreme court basically legislates from the bench a la Obergefell?Congress has already provided rules for the regulation of social media platforms. A lawsuit would have to show that these laws are unconstitutional. The existing rules on social media regulation will not be unconstitutional merely because of the scale and importance of those platforms. A free speech argument will not automatically work, (a) because the deplatformed person's free speech rights must be weighed against the platform's free speech rights, and (b) because the first amendment is a defensive right against the government, not against private entities such as a social media platform. Quite specifically, the amendment only says that Congress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech, but it does not prevent private entities from making rules about how their services may be used."}

A Better Way Wholesale Autos, Inc. v. Better Business Bureau of Connecticut, 2021 WL 5112673 (Conn. Superior Ct.

See  (U.S. 2021) (involving inaccurate terrorism warnings from a credit reporting agency). The TransUnion case essentially added a constitutional standing component to the publication and damages elements that would apply in a defamation action in the context of a statutory claim under the Fair Credit Reporting Act that doesn't expressly require either of these elements.Many of the legal issues, however, are .A survey of the issues in an E.U. context can be found at Thomas Hoeren, Big data and the legal framework for data quality International 25(1) Journal of Law and Information Technology 26-37 (January 8, 2017).  the abstract of which states:Power has a lot to do with knowledge, access to, and utilization ofdata.

{"question":"Question about IOLA accounts (IOLA = Interest on Lawyer Account Fund, see ).  (IOLA is called IOLTA in some states.)Our client has to pay restitution to Walmart.  It has taken me months to get payment instructions from Walmart but now we have everything set.  (I had to get them to assign a magic reference number.)The easiest way to make the payment is to use a web form and enter a credit card number.  That will generate an email receipt.  The slightly harder way is to mail in a check and then try to wring a receipt from the office that took three months to issue a reference number.Our client tried to make the payment to the court months ago but the court wouldn't accept payment.  The client wanted to get the money out of his bank account asap so he wouldn't spend it, so he wrote a check to our firm.  My supervising attorney (SA) put it in his IOLA account.  Now what?I think it's okay to briefly transfer the funds from IOLA to operating (business) and then make the credit card payment online.  SA disagrees and thinks the only kosher way to do this is to write a check on the IOLA account.  I'm going to do it his way but I'm curious whether his concern was a bit over the top.  He thinks what I'm proposing would constitute commingling of funds.If you prefer a more general question, consider almost all of the above background for why I'm asking the question.  Basically what I'd like to know is, is it okay to transfer a sum out of IOLA into Operating (Business) for five minutes in order to make an online payment using a credit card.  (IOLA accounts don't have credit cards associated with them.)What about writing a check on the IOLA account, to make a credit card payment?  (To me, that would not really make things more transparent....)It would be great to have an actual reference but a conceptual answer would be helpful too.","answer":"Note: The sources below are for client escrow\/trust accounts rather than IOLA accounts per se, but IOLA appears to be substantially similar in the sense that they represent funds that the lawyer is not free to spend administratively. In other words, they are trust funds subject to fiduciary duty and not ordinary operating accounts.The Staff of the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission considered such a possibility in their opinion . While not stating outright that such commingling is unethical if there is neither intent to defraud nor recklessness, it gives two reasons why it could cause serious trouble:<ol start='3'>Risks of Lawyer Commingling Client Funds in Lawyer's Personal or Business Account(a) Client funds become available to the lawyer's personal creditors in the event of an attachment of those funds pursuant to proceedings supplementary to execution or otherwise under the Depository Financial Institutions Adverse Claims Act. IC 28-9-1-1, et seq. Even if the identity of the funds is later clarified, the client funds may be frozen for up to ninety (90) days by virtue of the automatic hold provision of IC 28-9-4-2.(b) Upon bankruptcy, dissolution of marriage or death of the lawyer, client funds may become a part of the lawyer's bankruptcy, marital or probate estate. Once again, there may eventually be a separation of interests in the funds, but in the meantime, client funds will be unavailable to their true owners.(c) ...[a scenario involving actual fraud and\/or misappropriation]What they are saying is that even if you 100%, really and truly intend to just use your operating account as an in and out tool with full intention to devote your entire attention to promptly disburse the funds to their proper destination, that five minutes of commingling could coincide with some sort of legal event that would greatly complicate the payment.For example, you transfer the client's funds from the escrow account into your firm's operating account at Time=0, morally confident that the transfer will be complete at Time=5. Unbeknownst to you, an earthquake occurs at Time=3 in which you are knocked offline and you and your entire firm are killed by falling debris. The contents of your operating account are frozen by your bank and sent to probate. Your client and Walmart hire another attorney to spend the next few months arguing over what your intentions were and why all of that operating money needs to be paid over to Walmart.Similar to the above, you are in the middle of the transfer when a court order is served on your bank to freeze your operating account as part of some investigation into something entirely unrelated to your representation of your current client. Now, you are making your case to the court to unfreeze certain funds while Walmart is still waiting and your client is upset that you messed up something that should have been simple.<h3>A potential solution:<\/h3>The same opinion, in Attachment G, provides:Lawyers are permitted to advance filing fees for their clients out of operating funds, see, Ind. Prof. Cond. R. 1.8(e). In that event, no trust account questions arise from the use of a debit card that draws funds from an operating account.The opinion then seems to indicate that debit cards should not be used, but in this case they are talking about linking cards directly to the escrow account:May lawyers use debit cards to pay client funds for filing fees directly out of trust? The answer has two parts. First, current rules appear to prohibit it. Second, even if the rules were not an impediment, many banks refuse to issue debit cards on trust accounts.The professional rule  provides that lawyers may advance court costs and expenses of litigation. If the payment to Walmart can be considered a court cost or expense, it may be reasonable to pay the amount out of your operating fund and then immediately reimburse it with a client reimbursement from their escrow funds.The pay-then-reimburse model also mitigates the issue mentioned above about intervening causes stopping the transfer. If you have a heart attack right after advancing the funds from your operating account but before filling out the paperwork to reimburse yourself, neither the client nor the other party (Walmart) has been adversely affected."}

I did not know this in advance, but , which saysMopeds are considered vehicles for the purposes of vehicleregistration and license plate display. The department, county auditoror other agent, or subagent appointed by the director shall charge thefee required under RCW 46.17.200(1)(a) when issuing an original mopedlicense plate. Mopeds are exempt from personal property taxes andvehicle excise taxes imposed under chapter .Now you need to check all of the definitions to see if a motorized bike is indeed a moped. Definitions under RCW Chapter 46.16A yields nothing useful, but . A moped isa motorized device designed to travel with not more than three wheelsin contact with the ground and having an electric or a liquid fuelmotor with a cylinder displacement not exceeding fifty cubiccentimeters which produces no more than two gross brake horsepower(developed by a prime mover, as measured by a brake applied to thedriving shaft) that is capable of propelling the device at not morethan thirty miles per hour on level ground.If it has a small gas engine it is a moped. How can you interpret the clause having an electric or a liquid fuelmotor with a cylinder displacement not exceeding fifty cubiccentimeters which produces no more than two gross brake horsepower(developed by a prime mover, as measured by a brake applied to thedriving shaft) that is capable of propelling the device at not morethan thirty miles per hour on level ground: does the bold restriction apply to only the phrase liquid fuel motor or does it apply to electric or liquid fuel motor?There is a meta-rule of legal interpretation known as the last antecedent rule, which dictates that the bold clause only applies to liquid fuel motor (the thing right before the modifying clause). However, that rule of interpretation only applies when a clause isambiguous, and the only way to get an authoritative determination of ambiguity is to make the wrong assumption, get punished, then sue the government  the courts may or may not agree with your belief. Since an electric motor has no cylinder, the courts will not assume the legislature meant anything so silly, therefore for an electric bike, it is most likely (not guaranteed) that moped means motorized device designed to travel with not more than three wheels in contact with the ground and having an electric motor, period. Remember that the basic licensing law says Mopeds are considered vehicles for the purposes of vehicle registration and license plate display: a traditional gas moped clearly requires a license and everybody says so.Naturally, I assume you have a electric motorized bike, known as an electric-assisted bicycle, and that you are skeptical about the idea that an EAB is a moped (I am). Internal-combustion mopeds are defined in terms of limited power capability (a Harley Hog is not a moped), but that limit is part of the liquid fuel motor with cylinder displacement clause which doesn't sensibly apply to electric motors. Therefore an electric moped can have unlimited power capacity? Surely the legislature did not intend that (a claim about legislative intent is another tool in the arsenal of legal interpretation).You can start the search over to find out about the licensing requirement for EAB's, and you won't find anything that permits using it on the road without a license. Searching rcw electric-assisted bicycle license yields two helpful pages: <a href='https:\/\/app.leg.wa.gov\/rcw\/default.aspx?cite=46.61.710' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>RCW 46.61.710Mopeds, EPAMDs, motorized foot scooters, personal delivery devices, electric-assisted bicycles, class 1 electric-assisted bicycles, class 2 electric-assisted bicycles, class 3 electric-assisted bicyclesGeneral requirements and operation<\/a>. That statute starts by sayingNo person shall operate a moped upon the highways of this state unlessthe moped has been assigned a moped registration number and displays amoped permit in accordance with (also incidentally, a moped may not be operated on a bicycle path or trail, bikeway, equestrian trail, or hiking or recreational trail, but EABs are in the bike lanes all the time in Seattle).There is some ), but they also say They may be operated most places bicycles are allowed such as multipurpose trails or bicycle lanes, provided 'motorized vehicles' are not prohibited. (RCW 46.61.710). The statement that they are not licensable for street use refers to the part that saysMotor vehicle excludes: (a) An electric personal assistive mobilitydevice; (b) A power wheelchair; (c) A golf cart, except as provided insubsection (2) of this section; (d) A moped, for the purposes ofchapter 46.70 RCW; and (e) A personal delivery device as defined inRCW 46.75.010.Oops. Notice that the law does not say anything about EABs (also, the reference to mopeds is limited to laws about dealers and manufacturers, but not users).You may find that you , but eventually you won't find anything authoritative that says that no license is required. The state patrol page halfway hints that you can't drive them on the road at all  bad phrasing (not licensable?). Generally, the lack of a law requiring a license for an EAB would mean that no license is required. But if an EAB is a moped, a license is required.In lieu of a court case ruling that an EAB does or does not require a license, all you can do is read all of the laws and try to make sense of them. You could ask the state patrol, but they will tell you what they do, not what the law is (I have never seen an EAB with a license in the Seattle, which suggests that an EAB is not a moped for licensing purposes)."}
{"question":"I can find  something like \"money received\", but this seems vague for legal purposes.My specific scenario causing me to wonder is this:I have performed a service for someone.  They offer to pay me for that service.  I say \"hey, instead, give that money to so-and-so charity\".  They say \"okay\".Now, if they gave me the money, then it would be income \"money received\".  I could then give it to charity, but it was still income.But, if I tell them to give the money directly to charity, and I never \"received\" it, was it income?  I mean, these two things seem functionally equivalent... the money was mine, I earned it, the check just never was in my hand personally.I can think of an entire continuum of circumstances in between these two scenarios.... Exactly when does the money become my \"income\"?","answer":"Your example is a borderline case.If you receive compensation for you work, it's taxable. Compensation does not need to be money: it can be goods, services, actions, non-actions or whatever else you can negotiate or agree on. In either case, this is taxable at the fair market value of the compensation.If you create an agreement that states I do work for you and in exchange you donate XXX$ dollars to charity YYY  then this would clearly be bartering and as such it's taxable income.You could also create an agreement that you do this work for free out of the goodness of your heart. You may let slip that you would be delighted if the company would donate some money to a charity but as soon as these two things become causally  related, this becomes compensation income. This means that if the company chooses not to donate anything, there is nothing you can do about it."}

{"question":"I understand that restaurants need not follow the government mandated mask policy for their private place. But here a patron is willing or has opted to wear a mask. Can a restaurant deny service for wearing masks?Here is the  to the story, which quotes an employee at the bar:Our manager sent me over because Im nicer than he is. And yes, this is political.This can be extended for wearing religious garbs to not allow some patrons.","answer":"Yes as wearing (or not wearing) a mask is not a protected trait so there is nothing protecting a patron from being removed. While you make reference to religious garb a mask is not religious garb and should not be compared to that.While there are a few exceptions under some state laws, the answer is usually no. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 explicitly prohibits restaurants from refusing service to patrons based on race, color, religion, or national origin. In other words, restaurants do not have a constitutional right to refuse service. However, this law does not protect those from discrimination based on sexual orientation.This means restaurants can prevent gay people from entering their restaurant and it is not against federal law. There are up to about 20 states, including New York and California, that have enacted that prohibit discrimination in public accommodations based on sexual orientation. However, it gets even more complicated when factoring in local city ordinances within states that allow certain discrimination laws.Listed below there several legal reasons for a restaurant to refuse service, some of which include:Patrons that act in a certain way that is rude or disrupting other guests<br \/>Patrons that overfill the capacity of the restaurant can lead to safety hazards<br \/>Patrons that enter the restaurant after the restaurant is closed and no longer serving food to customers<br \/>Patrons accompanied by large groups of non-customers looking to create rowdy behavior after hours<br \/>For patrons lacking adequate hygiene or cleanliness, discrimination for this purpose is acceptable because it puts the health and safety of others in the restaurant or establishment at risk<br \/>Patrons who bring their dog to your restaurant, which is a violation of local health ordinances. When this happens it is okay to tell the patron to leave because of their dog. One exception would be if the dog is a service dog and protected by the American Disabilities Act.<br \/>Patrons looking to enter a private establishment that requires a certain dress code for etiquette purposes"}

{"question":"A lawyer's client sent me a mild threat via text message. I have contacted the attorney on 4 separate occasions requesting an explanation\/response from the attorney. They have not responded. Are there any ethics rules regarding this lawyer's conduct and failure to respond? Thx.","answer":"  Are there any ethics rules regarding this lawyer's conduct and failure  to respond?No. Typically the rules of so-called 'professional conduct' are that the lawyer owes diligence to his client, whereas the rules would say nothing about diligence toward the adversary. Pro hac vice does not subject that attorney to a higher standard than what local lawyers are expected to meet.If anything, a form of 'diligence' toward the adversary can be somewhat enforced through the deadlines stated in court rules (or rules of civil procedure) for the various phases or elements of a lawsuit.From that standpoint, the deadline to file a response (whether it is responsive pleadings, response to a motion, discovery requests, answers to a request for admissions, and so forth) is a way of converting diligence toward the adversary into diligence toward the attorney's client. That is because the attorney must meet the procedural deadlines for following up with the tasks that representing a client entails: motion\/request\/other that you initiate through court proceedings.In any case, the attorney's missing of procedural deadline(s) constitutes misconduct that only his client may denounce (or at least hold him accountable). If the attorney\/adversary missed a deadline to comply with a court order, the adversary and\/or his attorney might be found guilty for civil contempt and\/or be sanctioned."}

I.e. to push websites, web-services and other online\/offline entities to delete my personal data.Is there any way to punish them by law if they deny to do that?","answer":"In the broad sense encoded in EU law, there is no right to be forgotten in the US. Certain rights recognized in the Constitution, in particular in the Bill of Rights, which prohibit various government actions. The Constitution also gives Congress the specific power to regulate interstate commerce, which has been used to limit individual freedoms (such as the right to grow wheat). In deciding if a law limiting freedom is constitutional, the courts will apply the standard known as  in deciding, when a law restricts a fundamental right (such as the right to free speech). The requirement for passing such scrutiny are that the law is needed for a compelling state interest, it is narrowly tailored, and uses the least restrictive means to do this.There is no such law encoding a supposed 'right to be forgotten', although in certain circumstances one might sue for damages over an invasion of privacy, usually broken down into intrusion of solitude, appropriation of name or likeness, public disclosure of private fact and false light. A requirement to delete a person's posts or posts about a person, or records of transactions would not fall under these categories. The simplest answer to the question is, there is no such law, and it is hard to see what law could be constructed that is consistent with US Constitutional protections of individual freedoms. "}
{"question":"It is common in many jurisdictions to raise one's right hand before making an oath or affirmation. What is the origin and meaning of such a practice?This can help answer similar questions. For example, are there religious connotations connected to raising one's right hand? If so, would it be sending mixed signals to raise one's right hand when simply affirming before giving testimony, as opposed to the legally equivalent-but theologically different practice of swearing an oath before testimony? Knowing the origin of raising the right hand will clarify.Note: To confirm this question was on-topic, I first asked here: ","answer":"In Western law this surely derives from Biblical precedent. See for example Genesis 14:22, or Exodus 6:8. Some other times when hands are lifted up in the Bible, it's an expression of power. These concepts are linked in that an oath involves appealing to divine power to witness what is promised (and to punish the speaker if they break it).The story that it comes from forcing witnesses or the accused to display brands is false. While branding was used historically to mark certain criminals, these marks were not often on the palm of the hand, but could be on the cheeks or chest or elsewhere. Courts have never asked witnesses to remove their shirts while taking an oath. Even in the era when branding was used, checking for the marks would not be applied to all witnesses, but perhaps just to the accused.In contemporary practice, raising the hand is optional, and the oath or affirmation is taken as good if the court is satisfied that the witness is taking it seriously. Raising the hand might be seen as a gesture of respect for the law and not necessarily any particular religious tradition. Raising the hand while affirming is not unusual, nor even a mixed signal: affirmation arose because of Quakers wishing to observe the Biblical command swear not at all."}
{"question":"I'm a leader in a church-sponsored children's group.  We're going to attend a half-day \"day camp\" run by Boy Scouts of America.  The activities will include short hikes, archery, bb guns, and paddling in a shallow pond.  The camp is requesting from me (as a leader) a detailed medical history, including all past surgeries, all diagnoses, and full medication list.This is more personal information than I would like to provide and allow them to store.  If I refuse to provide such detailed information, and rather state that I'm physically able to perform my role as a leader, does privacy law protect me from being turned away?For example, and employer can't ask an applicant for a list of disabilities, list of illnesses\/operations, or medical history.  But they can ask if an interviewee is able to perform the essential functions of the job, or to undergo a medical exam after a job is offered. (Source: University of New England, )Notes:I've recently done activities which involved much more risk--whitewater rafting and sea kayaking. The touring companies I went through didn't ask for nearly as much medical info.I've searched a bit through HIPAA explanations, and the closest example I've found has to do with employers requesting records.  If I understand correctly, an employer has a right to require medical records if they feel they might need to make an ADA accommodation, or if job safety might be endangered.","answer":"You generally are not required to share your medical details with people you don't want to. That said, the camp would also not be required to allow people who don't comply to enroll. They can't force you to divulge your information, but you can't force them to let you come if you don't, either.HIPAA deals with the ability of healthcare providers to disclose medical information to parties who aren't the patient themselves - it would be a HIPAA violation for your doctor to disclose your information directly to the camp without your consent. HIPAA has absolutely no bearing on who you choose to disclose your own information to, however - you can disclose your own information to anyone you want."}

Section 107 of the Copyright Act provides the statutoryframework for determining whether something is a fair use andidentifies certain types of usessuch as criticism, comment, newsreporting, teaching, scholarship, and researchas examples ofactivities that may qualify as fair use.Reference: As far as trademarks go, there are similar provisions.  For example:Trademark owners have challenged unauthorized use of their trademarksnot only in domain names and metatags, but also in search engineadvertising campaigns and keyword purchases. Typically, marketingadvisors recommend these campaigns as a way to direct traffic to theadvertisers website, to achieve a higher ranking in search results,and perhaps also to divert traffic from a competitors website. If theadvertiser uses a trademark belonging to its competitor in a sponsoredad, it is likely to be infringing. However, the unauthorized use ofanothers mark can be legitimate fair use, such as in comparativeadvertising that compares the advertisers product to the product ofthe trademark owner, or a gripe site that criticizes the products orservices of the trademark owner.Reference: Added emphasis is mine.

(They can 'guarantee' in the sense that a car manufacturer guarantees that they will pay if your new car breaks down, but they cannot 'guarantee' like a car manufacturer cannot give a guarantee that your car won't break down). Since that company cannot guarantee that the data will be safe, you cannot guarantee that the data will be safe, which may make it illegal for a European company to let you store that data. Now if you store data for an airport in India, for example, that was collected completely in India, that would probably be a different matter. That would be a matter of Indian law. Whether India allows you to store data of Indian citizens in an unsafe way, I don't know. Your comment: The EU would not have any power to prosecute a company in India. If the European company didn't know what you were doing, it's quite possible that you would be in breach of contract if you look at the contracts that you have with them. If they knew what you were doing, any contracts with them might be void if you both agreed to do things that would be illegal, and that would create an almighty mess. "}

If it is a pure transcription, there is no creative element added - a translation would have such an element in some regard.Making a copy under copyrightCopyright is the exclusive right of the Author to make copies or assign the right to make copies. So by default, transcriptions are copyright infringement.However, there is fair use or fair dealing. In the US, Fair-use is defined as needing to satisfy the fair use factors more than not. They are defined in :the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;the nature of the copyrighted work;the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; andthe effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.In general, the second factor more often than not cuts against fair use in works of fiction. Transcription of the whole work also wouldn't necessarily be fair use, as the third factor demands the absolute minimal amount needed to be taken. However, factor 1 - personal non-profit use, especially for research or criticism - can heavily cut for fair use. And factor four, market impact, of a purely personal file that never enters circulation heavily cuts for fair use. As a result, it might be fair use, if for purely personal use.Sharing would alter the market impact: the more the file is shared, the more market impact it has - it is a full substitute, so it might be deemed to destroy the market of the original, cutting heavily against fair use."}

Would the TSA be able of charging you for anything and would they be able to inflict any repercussions on you (except for detaining you for longer)?","answer":"Intentional sabotage of a TSA computer system is almost certainly a serious crime and would also almost surely give rise to civil liability, although you might avoid both if you warned the TSA that the phone was set up to intentionally break their system, in which case it might be confiscated as contraband.If the product had a 'feature' unknown to you and that you had no reasonable reason to know of that caused the harm, you would ultimately have no criminal or civil liability, although the manufacturer might be strictly liable to the TSA under a product liability theory, and you would probably be detained as a witness to figure out what happened.If the product had a 'feature' that broke the TSA computer that could be de-activated and that you meant to de-active but carelessly failed to, you would have negligence liability to the government and might or might not have criminal liability (I'm not enough of an expert in the relevant statutes to know). You might be liable for a strict liability Federal Communications Commission offense for having a device that is in violation of their regulations."}
{"question":"I've always been interested in issues related to free speech, but they've also always seemed a bit tricky to make any determinations over as they encompass both opinions and strict legal codes. As I understand it, libel is construed as untruthful statements that damage a company in some way. But, what if someone's personal opinion is that a company is bad in some way, and then the company loses money as a result of that person voicing that opinion? Can they be sued? ","answer":"  As I understand it, libel is construed as untruthful statements that  damage a company in some way. But, what if someone's personal opinion  is that a company is bad in some way, and the company loses money as a  result? Can they be sued?Libel is a statement that tends to damage someone's reputation that is made to someone other than the subject of the statement. Truth was historically a defense to liability for libel (although in many circumstances in the United States is has been made part of the prima facie case that must be proved by an accuser).Ordinarily a libel must be a statement of fact, and a mere opinion is not actionable. But, sometimes an opinion so clearly implies a closely related statement of fact in a particular context that the implied statement of fact arising from the statement of opinion, if false, is actionable.Anybody can be sued, but they will not have a viable cause of action and their suit will be dismissed, if the alleged statement is truly a statement of opinion, even if it has consequences for a person's reputation and causes them economic harm.For example, if I say that Calvin Klein clothes look better than American Outfitter's clothes, and people care about my opinion and purchase fewer American Outfitter's clothes, I have not committed actionable libel (even if I don't sincerely believe what I said since it is an opinion either way), even though my statement harmed the company that makes American Outfitter clothes. If I were a celebrity known for being fashionable, such a scenario might even be a plausible one. "}
{"question":".  However, this provides a path for it to become a carte blanche unrestrained power of Congress.  This is a far cry from its intended aim of being a power which would only be exercised with a great self-restraint by Congress.Can this decision reach the SCOTUS only via a case brought by another impeached party?  Or is there another legal path for SCOTUS to consider it again?  Is there a path through an injunction?  I am not asking what would guarantee its overturn.  I am only asking about how the legal system works to make it possible (if a plaintiff succeeds in all challenges which they bring).","answer":"  Can this decision reach the SCOTUS only via a case brought by another impeached party?Yes. A case may only be brought by someone who has suffered or will suffer an actual injury.  The courts have established that a citizen's interest in the constitutionally correct functioning of the government is insufficient.  Or is there another legal path for SCOTUS to consider it again?No.  Is there a path through an injunction?Who would issue such an injunction?  What act would it enjoin?The court is very unlikely to take such a case."}
{"question":"This grows out of a comment in the question If a US citizen is currently resident in the EU, can that person use a GDPR request to the proper government agency (state board or elections or a similar agency)  to obtain that person's own voter record and whatever other information about that person the agency may have in its files?","answer":"I suspect that US voting records would fall under Article 2(2)(a):Article 2Material Scope...<ol start='2'>This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data:(a) in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law;I doubt it would be possible to argue successfully that a foreign election is anything other than an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law.Even the territorial scope could be questioned.  This is set forth in the next article, on territorial scope, the second item of which says:<ol start='2'>This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:(a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or(b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.It is probably arguable whether processing absentee ballots from EU residents constitutes offering services to data subjects in the Union, but in this case it's likely to be more difficult to resolve that question than to determine whether the activity falls outside the scope of Union law."}
{"question":"I am being asked to sign a contract after I completed the work. I do not fully understand the following non-exclusivity and non-solicitation clauses. What does 'solicit sales' mean? Also it never defines 'Competing Product' so could this in theory be extremely wide? Also are these two clauses contradicting each other?  NON-EXCLUSIVITYNon-Exclusivity. The parties expressly acknowledge that the Company is free to engage others to perform services of the same or  similar nature to those provided by the Consultant and the Consultant  is entitled to offer and provide services to others solicit other  clients and otherwise advertise the services offered by the  Consultant. NON-SOLICITATIONNon-Solicitation. During the term of this Agreement and for one year after the termination of this Agreement, Consultant will not  directly or indirectly, for itself or any third party:  (a)       solicit sales of any Competing Product from any person who  was a customer or prospective customer of Company during the term of  this Agreement or encourage any such person to reduce their purchases  from the Company; or(b)       solicit or encourage any Personnel of Company or its  affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing services  to, Company or its affiliates.  'Personnel' means any employee or  contractor of the Company or its affiliates during the term of this  Agreement. 'Competing Product' means any product or service that  competes or competed with any product or service sold, provided, or  intended to be sold or provided by Company or any affiliate at any  time during the term of this Agreement.","answer":"The non-exclusivity clause just means that you will still be allowed to work for other companies while you work for this one.The non-solicitation clause means you can't tell any of your employer's customers to use a competitor's product instead of your employer's product. It also states that you can't advise other employees of the company to leave your employer"}
{"question":"I am a bit experienced with firearms and know how to handle them. I take them out to the range and fire them. My friend is a hunter and recently gifted me with a SPENT 30-08 Springfield casing AT SCHOOL. Now in my school handbook it states:It shall be a Class I felony for any person to possess or carry, whether openly or concealed, any gun, rifle, pistol, or other firearm of any kind, or any dynamite cartridge, bomb, grenade, mine, or powerful explosive on school property.it also states thatInfraction 2Possessions, uses, or transfer of anything deemed as a weapon.This is not classified as a weapon since the shell was ejected, the powder was burned, and the casing was deemed \"Harmless\".I am asking this because my elementary school completely shut me down for having a bullet scale not behind powder or in a casing and they almost expelled me about 10 years ago if my grandfather hadn't stepped in.I need an answer here to calm my father down. I live in the United States in South Carolina.","answer":"The first passage quoted appears to be from the North Carolina General Statutes  (Issuance of permits.) subsection (M) (5). It is quite different in both wording and content.I do not find the second quoted passage in an online search, and I presume it is of the school's own writing.If you were in elementary school about 10 years ago it would seem that you are probably in high school or college now. Rules for those institutions are often quite different from elementary school and from each other.I have no way to evaluate what the school regulations on such subjects might be, but it is probably safer to leave your empty casing at home, although no rule you have quoted or that I can find online would prohibit it.An expended cartridge or casing is not a gun, rifle, pistol, or other firearm of any kind and so this provision of NC 14-269.2 would not apply, even in North Carolina.An expended cartridge is not likely to be defined as a weapon either, and so the second quotes passage should not apply, although it is possible that the school regulations define weapon differently so that an expended cartridge is included.I have no way to know what other provisions the school regulations might include that would be relevant."}

{"question":"I have trouble to understand the exact (legal) difference between binary options and gambling. Binary options are regulated in the United States by the CFTC and gambling is regulated by each U.S. state individually. Some U. S. state have allowed pari-mutuel betting while a few have not, and some other states allow online gambling. [Ref 1]Example from my understanding:Binary Option: Is Facebook trading over $ 300 on 30. January 2022 appears to be a binary option regulated by the CFTC.Gambling: Will Donald Trump be the next U. S. president? Appears to be regulated by the local gambling authority., a prediction market for YES and NO questions has been fined by the CFTC by $1.4m on the 4th January 2022. They announced, they have to removed some markets, and continued to operate until now although a fine has been spoken out by the CFTC.This is basically the part, which I don't understand. It appears the question decides the type of regulation. The type of regulation makes a fair difference. While a banking license requires million of assets a gambling license can be obtained for fairly low amounts.As part of the settlement deal, Polymarket has agreed to pay a $1.4 million civil monetary penalty and to wind down all markets displayed on Polymarket.com that do not comply with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and applicable CFTC regulations. [Ref 2]Summa summarum, does it mean that if a company creates a question (Yes\/No) on financial assets (like an option traded on an exchange) will be considered as a binary option regulated by the CFTC while a non-related financial question is considered as gambling?[Ref 1] [Ref 2] ","answer":"The primary distinction between gambling and non-gambling is whether something is a game of chance, and usually, the statutes of a state prohibiting gambling will expressly define it in those terms.The mere fact that there is some element of chance or probability involved, however, is not sufficient to make something gambling, and the fact that there is some skill involved in a game does not automatically prevent it from being gambling.Generally speaking, if the activity serves some commercial or economically useful purpose, like an insurance contract entered into by someone with an insurable interest in the outcome, or a contract regarding a security or commodity price, it will not be treated as gambling under U.S. law (Britain and Ireland draw the line differently).The status of prediction markets is still unresolved, but since many of them call upon the application of skill and knowledge, rather than random chance, to make predictions, and since their use, for example, by the CIA, has given them an air of legitimacy, more often than not, they are not treated as gambling.Binary options are regulated in the United States by the CFTC andgambling is regulated by each U.S. state individually.This isn't entirely true. But it does appear that the CFTC asserted jurisdiction over this particular prediction market type activity, and did not consider it to be gambling subject to state law regulation.Also, there is some federal regulation of gambling even though it is primarily a matter of state law.Indeed, this ruling was quite helpful in the long run to the prediction market industry. The case held that Polygon.com was subject to CFTC jurisdiction, which would take it out of state law gambling jurisdiction and it provided a road map to come into regulatory compliance:The platform offered off-exchange event-based binary options contractsand failed to obtain designation as a designated contract market (DCM)or registration as a swap execution facility (SEF).All it has to do is register with the CFTC as a DCM or SEF and it is in regulatory compliance (these aren't trivial undertakings and could require months of interactions with the agency and $100,000+ of legal work to accomplish, but there is a clear path to doing so).does it mean that if a company creates a question (Yes\/No) onfinancial assets (like an option traded on an exchange) will beconsidered as a binary option regulated by the CFTC while anon-related financial question is considered as gambling?No.The case held that the questions, for example, about who would win the next Presidential election, constituted a swap regulated by the CFTC and not gambling. It simply said that since the CFTC has jurisdiction and since Polygon.com had not complied with CFTC rules for conducting that activity, that it had violated the law."}
{"question":" indicates that accepting, for example, a presidential pardon, is considered an admission of guilt.If a person were to accept such a pardon, can they then still be held liable in a civil court for the same offense they were pardoned for? It would seem that the act of accepting the pardon could then be used as evidence in such a trial.","answer":"Yes, they can be sued civillyOr, for that matter, be prosecuted by another jurisdiction- pardons only work within the jurisdiction that issued them.In a common law jurisdiction, the pardon cannot be used as evidenceNor, for that matter, can a criminal conviction.This is partly because the elements that need to be proved for the civil wrong wont correspond to the elements of the crime. But mostly, because it just isnt allowed."}
{"question":"I've been watching a lot of episodes of the TV series Cops lately. A common scenario in this show is that when the police catch somebody who ran from them and ask why they ran they get the answer that the person in question had a warrant on him\/her.If somebody has a warrant on them, can't the police just go to their house and pick them up already? Or are all these people homeless\/hiding from the law?","answer":"Seeking out every person with a warrant would take more staff-time and resources than many areas can afford. As such, only the most serious warrants are actively sought out.Others are either passively tracked (officers have a description or image, so that during normal duties, they would recognise such persons) or only heeded if a check of a person already detained shows one (of the warrant is very minor).As well as this, many of the people with 'mid-range' warrants will make efforts to avoid police, such as by moving frequently; not reporting address details; staying with various friends or family, at their homes or businesses; being mobile as much as possible in public areas where few law enforcement personnel are likely to be present, let alone likely to recognise them as subject to outstanding warrants."}
{"question":"I co-own a web design agency, we're finishing up our first three jobs this week for some smaller, local mom-and-pop shops. Obviously the stakes aren't that high at the moment, but I was curious anyways, especially for future clients:Is it important to display a copyright notice on my client's website? Something like: ? 2019 My Business, LLCFortunately the people we've encountered and worked with thus far as a business have been very pleasant and trustworthy, but I know there are some people out there with ill intent. Does a notice like this somehow help protect us?  Could it harm us? It does seem a little strange to be putting our company name on someone else's site.","answer":"It is not critical, however, it can help and it can't hurt. You own the copyright and if you were to take legal action you would need to prove this - the notice is evidence you can use to do so. Note that some jurisdictions (including the US) require registration of copyright before commencing legal action and that damages only accrue from the date of registration.A more significant issue is: what rights does the website owner have? They may believe that their contract with you involved a transfer of the copyright to them: did it or didn't it or doesn't it say?"}
{"question":"I'm in the process of creating an app that facilitates communication between users to buy\/sell (legal) items. My team was talking about forming an LLC to prevent getting sued for personal assets. Keep in mind, we do not make money from the app nor do we handle money (digital or otherwise) anywhere in the app, we just facilitate the communication between users buying\/selling similar items and it's up to the users to meet and fulfill their agreed upon transaction. An auction of sorts, like craigslist, but in the US only.I've been doing research on LLCs and it seems like forming an LLC will not 100% relieve us of legal responsibility of a transaction gone wrong. So I figured (to save spending unnecessary money) it would be possible to just place disclaimers very prominently throughout the app and item transaction process. In the event something goes wrong during the transaction, we will not be liable.Will that resolve us of blame\/responsibility of someone shouting 'your app ripped me off! I'm suing you!'?","answer":"NoAny disclaimer is subject to a number of limitations:The other party must agree to it, if the disclaimer is a click wrap then this would suffice (generally).You cannot disclaim responsibility for everything: local laws in each jurisdiction will generally impose not excludable terms into any consumer contract. The mere act of trying to exclude them may invalidate the entire disclaimer and\/or leave you liable to prosecution for deceptive and misleading conduct.You generally can't disclaim liability for negligence: many jurisdictions consider that allowing people to act with no liability for their actions is not good public policy and so they put laws in place that limit such disclaimers.Your disclaimer is worthless towards people with whom you have no contract: if, for example, your negligence causes damage to someone with whom you have no contract then they can by-pass your disclaimer. It would be a really good investment to get professional legal advice on both the LLC and your disclaimer."}
